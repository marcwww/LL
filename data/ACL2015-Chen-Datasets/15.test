Baby	POS	5	these be awesome for on the go . you do not have to put a messy dirty bib back in you bag , just toss and go !
Baby	POS	5	this product be outstanding ! we use it to take we 2 year old and he car seat across the country and it work like a charm . it even allow we to take we son off a airplane and through a airport sound asleep ! he enjoy he `` stroller '' and would ask to ride in it as soon as it be hook up . it be a breeze to hook together and be a easy matter to take apart and reattach for security check . it be important to note that it only work with a latch system car seat . Ours be a older Britax Roundabout and it work perfectly . we be ask several time by airport personnel , other mother and random people where we get the product . over six year and several trip with we child , we have try a car seat bag -lrb- the strap break -rrb- and a back-pack strap thing -lrb- then we still have to carry we child or a stroller -rrb- and both be outrageously expensive and very disappointing . this inexpensive product be a true find and I intend to tell every parent I know travel with a car seat all about it !
Baby	NEG	2	I buy this after my second child be bear to protect we car 's seat from the child seat . I have the original thin Prince Lionheart from my first child and love it . this one be so bulky with the build in lip that it get in the way of anyone have to sit next to it in the car . also , the two part design cause so many problem as it constantly come undo cause the top portion to slip down -lrb- thus defeat the purpose of protect the seat -rrb- . it do catch spill , but the original thin seat saver do too and actually do a better job . I have just recently move the original one under my younger child and discard this one altogether . I will look for something else to put under my older child 's seat . I do not recommend this product .
Baby	POS	5	I love this product ! it be cute , easy to assemble , and easy to attach to the crib . however , the only problem I have come across be change the battery . you have to take it off of the crib , then take off the back panel , and then change the battery . my daughter 's crib be against the wall , so I have to pull she crib out every time I need to change the battery . the remote control work great , and the different melody -lrb- or rainforest sound -rrb- be really great . all around , I would say I would purchase this again !
Baby	POS	5	very nice product . bought multiple pair . velcro adjustment allow you to tailor the fit . reversible so you can see diff pattern . keep from scratch . prompt shipping . would recommend this product .
Baby	NEG	1	I buy this for we Joovy Ergo Caboose and it do not fit -- perhaps there be fine print in the literature state as much , but wish I have know before I go to the trouble of order it . look like a nice organizer -- too bad it be go back to Amazon , and I be go back to the draw board .
Baby	POS	5	it be a great bib . it have excellent coverage for my 2-year-old . now I can let he feed himself soup , ice cream , yogurt , etc. without worry about he get it all over he clothes !
Baby	POS	5	the picture doesnt do justice to this product . and the color be off as well in the picture . its sooo soft and feel great . I order this product along with the Papagayo bedding and it blend greatly with it . the Poker dot on the cover pad be exactly the same as the bedding . and the monkey be just adorable ! absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to everyone .
Baby	NEG	1	this pump be pretty terrible . some people like it , and for some people it work for a week or a month before give up the ghost . maybe Evenflo have poor quality control standard , but mine do not even work once . I get barely anything , and it pinch painfully to boot . I use a medelum until the motor finally give out -lrb- it be a hand I down -rrb- , so it be not like I have never pump before . complete waste of money , as it sound like you be just roll the dice on if you get a good one or not .
Baby	NEG	2	the cloth use for this product be too stiff to be kid-friendly . even though it be absorbent , but it scratch baby 's neck area . would not recommend this for other parent .
Baby	POS	5	we be a Halo Sleepsack family , both my kid -lrb- 28mo & 6mo -rrb- wear they . this one be particularly cute .
Baby	POS	5	my 3 month old daughter love both she sophie and she Pie toy . both be a soft rubber that smell good - somewhat vanilla - and both be squeaky , which delight she . the Pie toy be a early favorite and Sophie have more recently become a favorite as she learn how to stick the foot in she mouth . the one concern in we house be that the dog think these be he toy because they be squeeky , so we do have to be vigilant about keep they off the floor . we recently receive a second Sophie as a gift and now keep one at home and one in the diaper bag so she be never without it .
Baby	POS	5	this toy be so cute ! my grandaughter be maybe too young to really appreciate it yet -lrb- 4 month -rrb- but I hope she 'll love it eventually . there be several other , and they be all really adorable .
Baby	POS	4	this come prewrapped in cellophane - so it be hard to actually judge the product . it be a gift at a baby shower and as far as I can tell the recipient like it and say the sock be great . I do like the packaging - cute idea .
Baby	POS	5	Great for baby like mine who kick they cover off all night . it be nice and light in the summer and give extra warmth in the winter with pj underneath . love it !
Baby	POS	4	this be the first time I try the Thirsties Diaper Cover and the gusset really help to keep the leak in . you do need to change the diaper often becuase they will not keep leak in for long but that be par for the course if you be go the cloth diaper route . overall , the deign of the cover make it very easy for a quick change .
Baby	POS	5	before I leave the house I throw this necklace around my neck . my daughter be 6 month old and know this be hers to chew away . you cant even tell its a teethe ring and I feel safe know she wont drop it on the floor .
Baby	NEG	2	I be disappoint that this do not fit my active bjorn better . it also have a rough feel to it . it honestly work better just to put he in a bib and then tuck it into the front .
Baby	POS	5	I love this swim diaper . very easy to use ! just put it on and wash it off if baby poop ! what could be easier ? sure beat pay out the wazoo for swim disposable diaper . so good for the environment !
Baby	POS	5	we be one of those hippie family that do `` baby-led weaning '' . for those who do not know what that mean , we skip the puree and rice cereal and go straight to allow we son to try feed himself bit of `` real '' food at 6 month old . although we never use traditional baby food , we do give my son natural applesauce and full-fat unsweetened yogurt . instead of spoon it into he mouth , we `` load '' the spoon for he and hand it to he so he could learn to feed himself . these spoon be great for even a young baby to use for self-feeding . they be lightweight enough that we son could handle they even at 7 month old . they have a long handle , which be good for a baby that do not have pincer grasp yet and still grip anything in he fist . and the bowl be small and relatively deep compare to other baby spoon , so the food do not spill out too easily despite be maneuver by my little one who still flail a bit . the spoon be bright and my son love they . they be easy to clean and to carry in a diaper bag . I can not recommend they enough .
Baby	POS	5	I buy bumpkin , FuzziBunz and Thirsties when I be build my stash for my first child and the Thirsties fit my daughter the best from day one -lrb- well technically day 3 -rrb- . my daughter be 7 lb 6 oz , tall and skinny . the Thirsties cover fit she the best . the extra smalls -lrb- newborn -rrb- be great for she tiny butt and she wear they until she be about 4 month old . my daughter be now 5 month and the smalls be just now fitting she well . I like that the tab have the velcro material on they so you can overlap they for really skinny baby . the leg gusset be a little loose when my daughter be 3 month and under , but ever since she gain a bit of weight -lrb- maybe by 09 lb -rrb- they fit she perfectly . and the leg gusset do not leave mark on she leg like the bumpkin do -lrb- too tight maybe ? -rrb- . the few time my daughter have blow out of she cloth diaper , the Thirsties contain the mess well , unlike the bumpkin which get the poo everywhere . I be definitely keep these thirsty for the next child .
Baby	POS	5	I love these shell . we use they with gdiaper insert and work great . they be nice and trim . my little girl look very comfortable in they .
Baby	POS	5	I have buy 4 of these to date . two for my family to use and the other two as gift for family member . it be very durable and do a great job protect leather and cloth seat .
Baby	NEG	2	this item be over price . how can you expect anyone to pay that much for a child item which they grow out of so quickly . I think it should be in the $ 20 price range .
Baby	NEG	2	I get a lot of compliment on these because they be cute , but my 6 month old be crawl in they for no more than 5 minute and they be wear thin and the thread be unraveling . I be very disappointed . if you be look for leg warmer that will hold up with a active baby then choose a different brand .
Baby	POS	5	pro : while the price of these be a bit difficult to swallow , the bib be fantastic and very much worth it . all my daughter 's previous bib be far too big , and do not have the rolled collar like the Tommee Tippees do , and so the formulum that she spit back out would run down she neck and make she hair\/clothes sticky . with these bib , we no longer have that problem , as this ingenious design of the rolled collar catch \* everything \* . con : a bit costly , and the velcro backing be not as durable as one would expect when pay $ 7.50 per bib . overall : the best bib we have encounter so far , and we would definitely recommend they !
Baby	NEG	1	I can not get these bowl to stay suction onto we highchair tray for longer than 1 minute . I have try make sure the tray be perfectly clean & smooth , wet the bottom suction cup , etc. , but nothing will keep it on . my son do not even try to lift the bowl and it pop up and move around while he be try to eat . once even pop up before anyone have touch it at all ! if you want bowl that actually stay suction on , I would suggest the similar `` sassy '' bowl set that also have lid . they design have a removable suction cup that fit all three bowl . I think it work better because the suction cup be all one piece of flexible rubber and be not join to the hard plastic bowl like the Munchkin set be .
Baby	POS	5	I receive one of these as a baby gift and love it so much I come on Amazon to buy another one ! I have one attach to the diaper bag and one attach to the stroller -lrb- for walk and short outing that do not require the diaper bag -rrb- . this way I have the pacus ready where ever we be .
Baby	POS	5	I order these mitten because I want something to keep my six month old son 's hand warm for winter . these mitten do exactly what the description say . the large size fit my baby well with room to grow and the velcro strap be genius . there be no way the mitten be come off . I have wash they several time and the color hold up well . I have not notice any shrinking , even though I put they in the dryer . the price be worth it . I have already recommend they to other new mom . two thumb up !
Baby	NEG	1	I think these look like decent burp clothes from the picture . get they and they be super thin and after I wash they , they shrink-ed and get even thinner . I would not waste you money on they . I spend $ 11 on a 3 pack of Carter 's brand and they be WAY better and worth the money .
Baby	POS	5	these be absolutely the best bib ! we have three child and be still use the same bib from the first child who be now 7 . so easy to clean . excite to find they here because I think they do not make they anymore and guard the one we have like gold ! order more for we family and send some as gift .
Baby	POS	5	this be a great sleepsack for warmer weather . I purchase this for the end of summer\/beginning of fall and it be just the right thickness for the season .
Baby	POS	5	this be very nice item , for sure would buy again ! baby like to stay in this pad while i be change he .
Baby	POS	5	I love the Avent product line . since I last use they , they have definitely improve . with the new ring that hold the nipple in place , I do not have any issue with the bottle leak . this be a very nice surprise and a change that I do not mind complete a extra step for . as usual , they hold up great and limit the fussiness . the pacifier cover be lifesaver since I hate put they into the diaper bag without protection . with the cover , I no longer have to put the pacifier into a ziplock bag to keep they clean .
Baby	POS	5	I be give two of these cover and start use they when I bring my son home from the hospital . although they be a little big , and occasionally leak , I find they provide the best protection of anything I try . he be now six month old and can poop out of ANY diaper , except a cloth cover with a Thirsties cover . I like the new design where both tab have velcro on the outside , so no matter which side I attach first , the other side can layer over the first tab .
Baby	POS	5	I purchase these to wipe off my daughter pacus when it get dirty and they be perfect for that , but they be also perfect for wipe dirty face , and mouth after eat . these wipe be a great size and I love the many use for they . I feel better use these on the kid face over the one with chemical in they . I highly recommend these wipe for kid of all age !
Baby	POS	5	this be my favorite bottle brush because it stand up and it have a sponge at the end , not bristle . I think this be one of the only brand with that combination . brush with only bristle at the tip make a big splashy mess . I can not seem to use they without liberally spray everything within 6 foot when I wash the bottle . yeah , these brush do not last forever . neither do my kitchen sponge . I have be replace these every 3 or 4 month . I think that be a decent lifespan for something that be use multiple time a day , every day . go Dr. Brown .
Baby	NEG	1	I be give a double snap-n-go stroller as a baby gift from a relative . after two use , the stroller break and will no longer fold down . not only be I strand in a parking lot when the stroller break , but I have be unable to use the stroller -- and thus , unable to leave the house with my newborn twin - for ten week while I have go back and forth with Baby Trend 's customer service department . the Baby Trend customer service department have have I disassemble the stroller three time ... take and email two picture of the broken stroller ... I have have 3 + phone conversation with 4 different customer service rep ... I have wait a total of ten business day for two different box that be send to I -- neither of which be large enough for the stroller . all the while , I be a mother of four child under 4 year of age . they have be completely unreasonable in what they have ask I to do ... the latest request be to wrap the stroller in a black garbage bag to send it back to they ... something that FedEx highly discourage -lrb- and say there will likely be damage to the stroller -rrb- . I have literally miss out on many family experience due to this broken stroller and Baby Trend 's refusal to remedy this issue . we can not take out twin out of the house without a double stroller - and unfortunately , we make the mistake of get a Baby Trend product . do not make the mistake of buy this product . the only thing worse than the quality of the product be the level of customer service you will get from Baby Trend .
Baby	NEG	2	purchase THIS for a 5 month old who be DRULLING A LOT . he like put it in he mouth BUT WOULD not chew on it .
Baby	POS	5	good size - compact , but hold a lot . also very easy to take apart \/ reassemble between kid , and compact when store . we be use it again for we second and it hold ton of bottle . the grate be small enough to set small pump-part on to dry without they fall through .
Baby	NEU	3	although these spoon look colorful and cute it be hard to use they to feed young baby . they be too curved and it be hard for young baby to completely remove food from the bottom of the spoon . I imagine that these could be use for liquid food but they be not as good for puree for witch I recommend use flatter spoon .
Baby	POS	4	this be a great mobile , my only critique be that the song end too quickly . my son love it . almost 3 month old and he stare at it and fall asleep to the music .
Baby	POS	5	this be the perfect solution for all those bath toy for we . there be a compartment for shampoo , soap , loofah , etc , a compartment for small toy and a compartment for larger toy . I have not experience any molding , I just make sure it dry out before I use it next . the adjustable part of it allow I to fit it to my average size tub perfectly . this be so much better than anything that hang on the bathtub wall with suction cup !
Baby	POS	5	love this change pad and the Summer Infant naturally Yours change Table Cover -lrb- sell on Amazon -rrb- fit perfectly ! I highly recommend this cover to go with this pad ; I try other that be suggest and have to send they back b\/c they be too small -lrb- b\/c of the length create by the side at either end -- the summer infant cover be 37 in . long , so it work with the side -rrb- . the pad be great -- high quality and fit my antique dresser just as I have hope .
Baby	POS	4	I be travel with 2 year old twin and already have my hand full without they run in different direction . use this to attach to we luggage -lrb- both carry on and med size -rrb- and it work wonder get we to the ticket gate , past security , and even to the rental car booth . we never have to worry about where the kid be run off to - it be very easy to install and use . we kid enjoy be able to stroll through and watch what be go on around we . we receive a ton of compliment of how smart we be to get the strap and how other wish they have think of it . great product , good quality , and a life saver !
Baby	POS	5	love this bib for the kiddo . catch the sloppy food that would otherwise be in she lap . while its flexible enough to be comfortable for the baby , its sturdy enough -lrb- unlike clothe bib -rrb- to stay in place . buy three of these and wash they after each use with dish soap and water and you 'll never have a smelly mess of bib wait to be wash -lrb- which be also very tempting for the puppy dog to get into -rrb- . in one word ; indispensable !
Baby	NEG	2	very cute but absorb everything . they probably work really well with cheerio but that be not what I need they for . pasta sauce - absorb , watermelon juice - absorb , water - absorb . I find that they do not protect clothing underneath . but they be cute !
Baby	POS	5	very helpful when kid put they dirty shoe on the back of the car 's front seat ! I would recommend it for anyone who have kid or spend time in snowy or rainy weather !
Baby	POS	4	Thought I order a blanket . do not realize a blankie be a miniature version . the granddaughter both love it , though , and enjoy snuggle and carry it around .
Baby	NEU	3	I be have a hard time with bottle for my daughter - she stop use they when I be home for summer vacation as I nurse . I find one think Baby sippy cup but it be tall - she like the spout - I buy this kit because they have different size of bottle - I also buy the sippy attachment kit - the normal nipple leak - however when I use the sippy nipple I have no problem - I like that I can just change nipple and add handle .
Baby	POS	5	1 . never irritated we baby 's skin . smell nice . 2 . you do not have to rinse it , so it be great when you hand be full or while travel -lrb- the dispenser lock in close position -rrb- . I higly recommend it . Cheers .
Baby	POS	4	the tine be not as pointy as they look in the picture . this be very nice for Oatmeal in the morning , since it do not get heat up by the food .
Baby	NEU	3	slide off the active model but keep the drool off which be the point . actually wish I would just make a couple from a old tea towel , its a waste of money to be honest .
Baby	POS	5	this be a great snuggle toy . the fabric use be very , very , soft -- that smooth yet plushy type fabric . a little doll come out of the peanut casing . he have two taggy for hair , and a blue body . the body have arm but then a round body without leg . the casing say Lil Peanut on it . as I call my daughter `` peanut '' I want she to have it for Christmas -- and she love he ! she have not learn how to take he out and put he back in , but she will bring he to I so I can do it for she . Great little toy !
Baby	POS	5	Worth the money , come from a lower income mom and a nurse , more than the best idea . just think about the money you 'll save on formulum , the pump pay for itself ; especially if you go back to work .
Baby	POS	5	my son do not take a pacifer and he do not normally use this item except when he be teethe . he will chew on this all day long when he tooth be break the gum . it work esp . well if you put it in the freezer . my son chew on the handle even more that he chew on the raz-berry part .
Baby	NEG	2	we own the original size sleep sheep when my now-5 year old be bear , and although we like the product fine , it be not a must-have . when my youngest son -lrb- now 5 month old -rrb- start show sign of colic , we buy the travel version hope that it would help he to at least rest a little while we be out and about . the product have all kind of technical difficulty - there be a timer that be suppose to allow the sound to play for either 25 or 45 minute . do not work . the machine frequently shut off after a few minute , usually right as the baby be about to go to sleep which of course wake he back up . also , I often have trouble get it to play at all and have to fiddle for 5 minute with the volume knob and try different button to get it to start . it be not the battery because we change they constantly . just a faulty unit , I be sure but for $ 25 I expect better .
Baby	POS	5	I get so many compliment when I put they on my 4 month old daughter . they be super cute and have plenty room to grow . the color go with almost anything in she wardrobe , she get lot of compliment when wear these adorable leg warmer !
Baby	POS	4	I nurse my son with the original Boppy for a year . yes , it be wonderful and everything the other reviewer say . however , my issue be that it begin to `` bend '' in the middle from use . really , this be fine ... I mean a year of nursing be go to be hard on any pillow . but my main complaint be that the cover they make for these thing be not waterproof -lrb- or spit-up proof -rrb- . what be the point of a cover ? I have to wrap my entire boppy in saran wrap , then put the cover on to get any protection nd prevent smelly stain . just my two cent .
Baby	NEG	1	now that I have have this bib for a bit I hate it ! the neck be too big , it do not adjust well , and worst of all there be some sort of stabilizer or something on the back side that be peel off . its a huge mess and I worry that one of the kid will eat some of it as it fall off . I probably wash it wrong or something , but seriously , its a bib , one that get use everyday -lrb- or use to -rrb- I need to be able to wash it in hot water .
Baby	NEG	1	I purchase this bib because the concept be great and the design be so attractive . but like other have say , only one side be laminate and so mold and stain develop and be impossible to get out . for a relatively pricey item , this be a huge disappointment . I have to toss it out and would not recommend it .
Baby	POS	5	this be we fourth bummi - we son have always be in cloth diaper and we have use bummi as the over-protector for about 2 year now . they wear well -lrb- we wash they at least 3x \/ wk . -rrb- we also use thirsty as well as the cover we diaper service give we and i think both bummi and thirsy be really solid product .
Baby	POS	5	I start cloth diaper with a rental place , get set up with pul cover , but then stumble on the wool cover world . this be my first child , I purchase two , and will never go back to PUL cover . I love how they breath , he cloth diaper even sometimes start to dry if he be nap and wet they , because of the wicking characteristic of wool ! will always use these , and I highly recommend and even try to convert friend over to wool , and cloth diapering !
Baby	POS	5	love this necklace . I be so sad that I could no longer wear jewelry because my son try to pull everything . not only be this necklace gorgeous , but my son love to play with it . I have have numerous compliment on how beautiful this necklace be . I recommend it for any mommy .
Baby	POS	5	seriously , cuter than the picture -lrb- and almost as cute as the litte girl in the picture -rrb- ! they come in a cute , partially clear pastic packaging , so that they could be display appropriately . love they !
Baby	POS	4	I purchase the large swimmus -lrb- 22-30lbs -rrb- because my 16 month old just reach the 22lbs pound range . I return it to purchase the same in medium -lrb- 15-22lb -rrb- because my son be build very thin and have no tush . the medium fit well and I think it will still accommodate he for awhile . even if it do not and I have to re-purchase the large , it be still cheaper than have to buy a pack of disposable swim diaper .
Baby	POS	5	do the job it be intend to do ... what we like about this particular product be that it have `` 4-sided wall '' where most other product only have 3 .
Baby	POS	5	when I first start my baby on food , we go through several fabric bib a day . have to use stain stick on everything before laundry day , and even with the presoak , I ruin several of my favorite coordinate bib . the only one that be sure to get clean be the white one , since I could use bleach . I read about the superbib and it seem like the solution . so , I order it , and be happy to report - this be the BEST bib ever for baby new to feeding . it be almost like plastic , but softer than that - I feed baby , rinse this in the sink , and lay it on the drainboard . by the time baby be ready to eat again , the Superbib be dry and ready . if it start look stain up , I run it in the wash machine -lrb- not dryer -rrb- , and it look good as new . I actually purchase 3 of these , one for the home , one for travel , and one for grandma 's house . I will agree with other reviewer who report that the pocket do not really catch stuff . now that baby be eat mum-mum , I find that crumb end up in the lap or highchair . the pocket do not really stick out , so do not catch anything . so , if you purpose be to catch wet food and save the traditional cloth bib , this be the product for you . if you purpose be to save the lap and highchair from dry crumb , not so much . all in all , I love it , and will be use it for some time to come .
Baby	POS	5	ship quickly and be fairly easy to put together . I do it myself , while my husband watch the little one . take I about a half hr , only because I have screw a couple of the shelf peg in the wrong spot . my husband be 6 ' 3 '' -lrb- I be 5 ' 6 '' -rrb- so I do add the wheel to it and help with the height . it be a sturdy piece of furniture . no dent or broken piece during the shipping process . the price be also why we purchase it . no where could we find one with this quality for that price . only have have it for a couple week but I would recommend this product .
Baby	NEG	1	the bowl be fine , but the suction do not work for even a minute on the smoothest plastic . definitely would not buy it again .
Baby	NEG	1	note : now there be a recall on medelum power adaptor too I own both the medelum pump in style advance and ameda 's purely yours pump . Ameda 's pump be better than medelum . see below . I do not use my medelum pump at all despite have waste about $ 300 on pump and spare part . I be a work mom so I pump a lot with baby # 1 and be do same with baby # 2 - already have a freezer full of milk . why ameda be superior to medelum : 1 -rrb- no mold growth - milk can not get into tube . see below . after I find mold on my medelum pump I go out and buy a ameda pump right away . 2 -rrb- about half the price as medelum if you just buy the pump and not the bag etc. . 3 -rrb- the ameda pump be easily freestand , also have nice slot on the pump to hold you pump milk in bottle . if you remove the medelum pump from the backpack or bag you 'll see the pump casing - the medelum pump have hole in the case around the pump so you do not really want to take it out of the bag - and nowhere to put you pump bottle so they do not fall over . FYI Ameda pump have last since 2008 with pump daily 5 days\/week -lrb- I breastfeed baby # 1 for 18 month -rrb- and it be still go great - I be use it again now . Medela know about the milk in the tube problem - in fact there be instruction about this in the booklet that come with they pump . well , I get milk back up in the tube more than once despite follow the instruction in the manual . then I have to stop pump and dry the tube out . no more pump that day as I do not have spare tube . and , to my horror , despite run the medelum pump for a couple of minute after every pump as per instruction , and dry out the tube if they get milk in they , I open the faceplate of the medelum pump one day and find mold grow on my medelum pump . that be it , I buy a ameda pump and have never go back .
Baby	POS	5	I be write from my husband 's account , but want to share how amazing this product be ! I love it and can not live without it . pump save I really , since after those first 3 day of have my baby my breast be kill I and I almost give up breastfeeding ! but I decide to give pump a shot , and it hurt a bit at first since my breast be so swollen and sensitive - but after a few try I get so use to this pump and even decide to buy a second one to maximize my pump time ! so I highly recommend , if you can afford purchase it , to buy the Avent dual electric pump , since it cost less than buy two single electric pump ... and unfortunately I do not know how much I would like pump and have to buy two singles , one first and later the second . it be amazing to be able to give my baby breast milk without go through the pain of breastfeed every 2-3 hour -lrb- my baby be a barracuda ! -rrb- . so I alternate between pump and breastfeed , and also help with pump milk once you have to return to work as well as pump for the night - if you want someone else to feed the baby and you can sleep to recover ! also I would like to add that if you do buy this pump , buy all avent product since it make it so much easier to transfer from pump to bottle , to plastic avent recipient to any other avent product ! they be all amazing and I be search amazon now for any other Avent product I do not have yet ...
Baby	POS	5	I absolutely love cute hat on baby , love . once I find these adorable ` Lil Monkey Hats , I \* know \* I have to get one for my little girl that be due in July . I purchase the ` Lil Monkey hat with pink trim and will be use it as part of she `` come home '' outfit . : -rrb- keep up the great work and I look forward to more amazing product from ya 'll . : d
Baby	NEU	3	my husband bougth it for I because I want so badly for my return to work . we live in Costa Rica and here it be so expencive that we decide to get it from amazon . the pump it be great , I be so happy that now I can extract milk in 15-20 minut and not 40 . but the box do not come with wthat I be expect , no ice pad , bag to carry the breast milk , extra diafragma or valvula . like the one I have -lrb- the single one -rrb- too bad that amazon do not give a description of the product .
Baby	POS	5	I be hesitant to buy this product - I have shower door , and no review mention door , just curtain ... I be happy to say , it do work with my shower door -lrb- see picture -rrb- and meet we need . the two tray be tight to slide together -lrb- as mention in other review -rrb- . once adjust however , I know they 'll stay put . we toy fit well inside the basket ; there be more space than I expect . my daughter have -lrb- so far -rrb- be good about pick up she toy after she bath , so I can happily announce that they be no longer scatter across the tub and floor after every bath ! I be able to move the basket to the front , middle , or rear of the tub -lrb- depend on who be use it at the time -rrb- . for those review that say this be a unsafe product - the first warning read , `` Bath Storage Basket be not to be use to assist in balance . use only as intend : to hold toy , bath care item , etc. '' I would not want my child pull themselves up on something plastic and unsecured anyway , especially in the tub . clearly it be not go to be stable unless bolt down . if you think you child will be pull themselves up , no tub storage would be a good idea for you ... or , just remove the basket during bath time . I would certainly buy this product again , or recommend it to a friend .
Baby	POS	5	I have two set -lrb- over 4 year -rrb- , and these be awesome ! of course , any suction bowl do not really stay down . you kid will figure out how to get they off ! however , these be still my favorite bowl . they be incredibly stable and sturdy , they travel well -lrb- for snack , even wet one -rrb- , and they last age . only wish I could afford 50 more , and that there be a easy way to attach the lid . I use they for a 5 and 1 year old , and have send they to work with dad , too , for salad dress .
Baby	NEG	1	horrible , the back be not at all like the package or the image shown-it be sharp edge and ridged and do not stay up in any way
Baby	NEU	3	we try everything when we daughter be teethe , include the raz-berry . at first she like the novelty of the cold , but she never get into actually chew on it . I think this may be because it be somewhat shape like a pacifier and she never take to pacifier either . also , when freeze the plastic of the raspberry do not seem to give very much . she favorite teether be Sophie the Giraffe . she also really enjoy we put ice cube in the munchkin fresh food feeder bag . she love that ! if nothing else it be always a good distraction .
Baby	POS	4	I have purchase several other waterproof pad but they be all so rough after a few wash and I do not like that against my newborn 's skin . so I purchase these , which come 2 in a pack , and they machine wash and dry well and be much softer than any of the other pad I own -lrb- I have several brands\/types -rrb- . they will not fully cover a crib or pack n play -lrb- maybe a mose bassinet -rrb- as they be not so large , but would do the trick for a change table or to put under you baby when they be in the swing or bouncer to catch any diaper leak or spit up . expensive , but I think worth it since they be so much nicer against the gentle baby skin .
Baby	POS	5	the travel toddler be a fantastic invention worth its weight in gold -lrb- or more , since it be quite light -rrb- for parent travel with young child and they car seat in the airport . we recently travel with we 2.5 year old -lrb- 30lb -rrb- and she  First year true fit convertible car seat  to transport the car seat , the travel toddler be ingenious . it attach quickly to the latch strap and top tether of you car seat to give you a easy way to roll you seat through the airport -- much easier than the GoGoKidz TravelMate , which take far more time to install . the only drawback I see of this product be : \* you need make sure you route you latch strap through in the forward face position , or they may not be long enough to reach around you suitcase -- so if you be use you car seat rear-facing , you 'll have to re-route the latch strap before reinstall it in you car . not a big deal , but take a few extra minute . \* not so much a drawback of this particular product , but of this concept in general : this strap turn you car seat into a very novel stroller , which will likely attract you toddler 's attention . sound good in concept , right ? in practice , 20lb of suitcase -lrb- or more -rrb- plus 20lb of car seat plus 30lb of toddler make for one really , really heavy contraption to be pull through the airport ! the product photo show a man push the seat and suitcase , but in reality , to get a angle that keep you child 's foot off the floor , you have you exert a fair amount of force , and at 5 ' 10 '' , I would be walk pretty bent over to accomplish that . so we pull it -- still bent over , but less awkwardly . overall , I highly recommend this product and will keep it in my travel arsenal for quite some time .
Baby	POS	5	I buy 6 of these blanket for my little guy and they be perfect . the color be exactly as picture , they be stretchy and big enough to swaddle . they be also very soft . I would recommend they to anyone !
Baby	POS	5	we use prefold with a snappie with this cover . we like the design . it be pretty gender neutral . the only difference I have notice between this cover and a thirsty duo wrap be that it do not have snap that let you adjust it even more . but , that have not really be a issue as we son fit in this pretty well . the velcro have hold up pretty good so far . just remember to use the laundry tab whe you wash they with other diaper . we find that hand wash work too and be a little faster when you be low on cover but still do not have a full load to wash diaper . overall , this cover be great !
Baby	POS	5	this light blue one look like a scarf on my daughter . Navy and Red look like western bandana -lrb- so cute ! -rrb- . absorb like a dream . well make . Wish all we bib be these ... we would only need 3 per day instead of 6 of the cheapo . I have 7 in different color and use 1 per day . I save it for when we go out so that she still look cute and she outfit be not ruin by a ugly\/huge bib . if only I could afford 21 of these ! -lrb- have to buy some color directly from silly Billy 's website , but shipping be cheap there . -rrb- love
Baby	NEG	1	there be no way to mark the correct position of both piece so they would fit together properly . after ruin one piece by put it in the wrong position , we put mask tape on the back of it to line it up with the second piece . that work as a trial -lrb- and something we should have do first -rrb- but when both latch and catch be properly line up , the door would not unlock , as the cabinet door be evidently too thick , although the writeup say the lock would work on door up to one inch ... we give up , think about screw they on , but decide it be not worth the trouble . if you want to use the magnetic lock , be sure you cabinet door be less than one inch thick . a waste of money on we part . tome
Baby	NEG	2	I be hope that these would be thicker . they be super thin ... much thinner than a cheap hotel washcloth . I think I 'll be better off folding a burp cloth over the Bjorn front flap so we little one can chew on it without the saliva soak through . I be expect the bib to be more substantial than this , especially for the price .
Baby	POS	5	this be we first time travel with we little one , but I can not even imagine have to have carry two carseat and all we carry on and manage a wander 2 year old and a bossy 4 year old . for the time where we have to unstrap the seat to get on the plane , I be eternally grateful for the strap make it so easy to get through the rest of the airport . a MUST BUY for everyone with little one !!
Baby	POS	5	we have be use the standard child lock throughout we house but we have a few drawer where the countertop overhung too much and we could not get we finger in between to unlock the drawer . these magnet lock work perfectly . I would like to put these throughout the house if they be cheaper . they work really well but its a good idea to order some extra magnet key . my wife keep lose they throughout we house and we get lock out of we drawer !
Baby	POS	5	I purchase this mobile for my new grandbaby and she love it ! it hold she attention and be very attractive .
Baby	POS	5	I have use fuzzibunz -lrb- which we love -rrb- and bum genious as well as prefold and other CD brand . I have the opportunity to review this diaper and i have to say when i first see its desing i be apprehensive . be use to pocket diaper where you stuff the insert , the way this be to be put together throw I off , but alas i try it out . and boy be i suprised . first the soaker be super duper absorbant . so much so that they last thorugh the night without any leak at all !!! I have yet to be able to accomplish this with any other CD unless i put like 4 soaker and my little man have a huge fluffly butt . one soaker pad be all it take i do not even have to double the soaker . needless to say i be in love with this diaper and the design we get be beyond cute .
Baby	POS	4	my 4 month old boy love this . it really help to settle he and will watch it for a hour ! I wish it play for longer than 15 minute but there be a remote to restart it from the doorway . one downside be that I have to oil it ! it squeak SO loudly when turn I have to turn it off . still , it be fine since I oil it : -rrb- .
Baby	POS	4	very useful to have velcro attachment . imagine pull off a wet , dirty diaper with only elastic at the waist -- messy ! I plan to buy the next size when he outgrow this one .
Baby	POS	4	this be a all around fun teethe product . my son love gnawing on it when he gum be bother he and I love watch he ! the rippled silicone texture be awesome for chew but be careful , it also have a tendency to pick up any fuzz or lint that come off blanket , sweater , teddy bear etc. . . I find myself have to wash it off every time it leave he mouth . aside from that , it be great - we have several !
Baby	POS	5	in 2008 we unexpectedly find out we be have identical twin which would be we 3rd and 4th child . we be a one income household so that I could be a stay at home mom so I do not have $ 400 to $ 700 to spend on a twin stroller that start at the infant stage . if you be just begining you research or be purchase for a loved one who be expect , please note that very few double stroller will actually accommodate infant twin . this stroller be amazing . it be easy to assemble -lrb- take only 30 minute -rrb- and customize to you car seat . it fold up very flat -lrb- much more so than a regular double stroller -rrb- . it be very lightweight and pop out to full size with no problem . I have have it in a car trunk and the back of the van so it can go in multiple vehicle size . I think the absolute best part be the convenience factor . my twin be bear in December so it be such a comfort not to have to take they out of a nice warm car seat and put they into a cold stroller seat . you simply lift you car seat off the base and pop it into the stroller and lock it down . baby remain undisturbed and out of the element . the car seat also help to shield they from people and germ when they do have to be in public . I would pull the sun shield up and lay a blanket over it and drape it over the handle to deter people from lean over the baby . Trust I - you can not be too protective when they have be in the NICU . the maneuverability be also better than average . it get around a lot easier than the double stroller I have now - probably due to it be weight . I would push it into the exam room at the doctor and it make it simple to do one baby exam at a time . I do not always have the luxury of have someone to accompany I when I have to get out with the twin and this system make it easy to do by myself with confidence . the metal frame also work for be creative with option . I purchase a screw on umbrella from CVS that fit on the frame and it work as a excellent sun shield for summer . the large basket underneath be big enough for a large diaper bag and my purse . all in all , the value , design , resell and convenience of this can not be beat . you have to buy car seat so this just maximize they use and value as well . I wish I have know about the single option when my first child be bear and I would have purchae it instead of the crappy `` stroller system '' that I overpay and underutilize due to it be multiple design flaw . if you go with this one you will not regret it .
Baby	POS	4	OMG -- possibly the cutest thing I have buy for my little . he be a big boy , though , and , unfortunately , these pajamas purchase for he at about 8 month be quickly too small .
Baby	NEU	3	I have install some of the original Mommy 's Helper Safe-Lok and the new one with the disable feature . neither of they be particularly straightforward to install , but once you do one the other be a lot easier . I find both kind of Safe-Lok to be much more effective than any of the four kind of Safety First cabinet lock I try -lrb- the Safety First one break if you pull the cabinet too hard , as you might do if you forget the lock be on -rrb- . while the disable feature sound great , they change the design slightly and it be not as good as the original . the mount bracket be much harder to install than the original , but more importantly , the reclose protection feature do not work on these new one -lrb- it work great on the original -rrb- . you have the option of not use the disable feature and mount the lock arm directly onto the cabinet without the outer mount bracket , but the design of the lock arm be change in a few subtle way that still render the reclose feature ineffective . I would highly recommend get the original Safe-Lok without the disable feature .
Baby	NEU	3	this be super adorable , and fit you shoulder well , but it be not very absorbent for baby who have excessive spit up .
Baby	NEG	2	portability , I give a 5 ! but the suction noise be extremely loud , my boyfriend even ask if there be a additional knob to turn the volume down lol . the suction be pretty good , though . even so , it seem to give out after 20minute . it be not that many part , but there be a little blue piece that you have to make sure not to lose , it be essential to the pump . . but they include a spare .
Baby	POS	5	we dd start have reflux on she second week and the one thing that seem to sooth she be a plain vacuum cleaner or a hair dryer , but we end up all annoyed !! ... we day care provider tell we about the sleep sheep and we actually have receive it as a gift but have not really use it on those ocassion where we dd be unconsolable due to the reflux ... this thing work !!! it make she so calm and every time she look sleepy we just start some ocean wave sound and we feel sleepy with she too !! ... also , this one be the small one and it be so practical to take in the car , the stroller , the swing , the crib ... anywhere ... so we have one for day care and one for home ... at first I do not think it would work but it do , and wonderfully ...
Baby	NEU	3	I buy this brush because I be a big fan of the Dr. Brown bottle . I think this brush clean the bottle very effectively until it start to show wear and tear after a few month . in all honesty , this brush last for about 8 month for I , but we do not use it daily to clean bottle , as most of the time we run the bottle through the dishwasher . the sponge start to break down , which be not a big deal as sponge do not last too long , but the wire stem be pretty flimsy out of the box and just break today .
Baby	NEG	1	just like the other have say , the cushion on this potty get so nasty . it just absorb any fluid waste . just plain yucky . and you can not use the potty without the cushion ! I have try soak it in bleach water , but who want to do that every day ? the bleach break down the cushion make it feel sticky\/gummy . bad , bad , bad .
