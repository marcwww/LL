Video_Games	POS	5	there isnt much I can really say about this series that hasnt be say to death but ill be the first to tell you , they be right . the sheer scope and size of the game and its contents be just mind blow with ton of thing to do while you be not try to finish the story . . you could easily put 30 hour into the main story and a amazing number of side mission and minus game to do , and the new social system be great as well which allow you to `` hang out '' with certain character from the story which can benefit you as the story progress depend on who be cool with you and who hate you Main game 5 out of 5 . lose and damned Ill admit im nowhere near finish with it but imagine they take regular gta4 , give you new interior location , new character , car , and even radio station then throw in the attitude and kick arseness of son of Anarchy and you have L&D; . and last but I assume not least be the ballad of gay Tony , havent even touch this one yet and ill be honest with the pure length of the main game + l&d; it might be a while before I get to tony . . all in all its a solid production where Rockstar didnt cut any corner at all , top notch voice act , well think out minus game that dont feel like a grind , i could go on and on about the great stuff in this game but I wont however , I do have one last bit of information . it have multiplayer with up to 16 in some of the most insane action and chase outside of a Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer film , wanna know more quit be cheap and buy this package , i pay 20 for it last month and I wouldnt be unhappy if I pay a full 59.99 +1
Video_Games	POS	5	I be a avid fan of Nintendo . still , I feel the release of the 3d be a bit rush . the launch game be lack , be mostly remake or gimmicky game try to show off the capability of the new system . with this game however , Nintendo hit the sweet spot . they have make a truly amazing game on they revolutionary new console . the platform feel spot on , with game play from 2d and 3d Mario game . if I have to describe it , I would say it be 2.5 d , if that make any sense . it be like a 2d platformer , but instead of have just a foreground to play in , you play in multiple foreground and background . this game have tanookus fever . there be tanookus goomba , tanooki bullet bill , tanookus bowser , and of course , tanookus Mario . defeat goomba with my tail be something I have not do since Mario 3 . this game be HUGE . in order to have a 5 star file you have to complete all level , get all the star coin , complete all level as Luigi , get to the top of every flagpole , and get to the top of every flagpole as Luigi . con : the tanookus suit make thing almost too easy , it almost feel like cheating . in the last couple of level be hard in a bad way . they only give you 30 seconds to complete they , with clock scatter over the level that give you 10 extra seconds . and they use Shadow clone , shadowy Mario doppleganger that follow you every move , damage you if they touch you . it make I feel as if I be run out of a building that be go to explode with a gunman chasing after I . overall , the good outweigh the bad , give you no reason to pass up on this game .
Video_Games	POS	5	we purchase Epic Mickey for we 10 year old son for Christmas . he be a avid gamer and have play through almost all of the Mario game , as well as a few Link game , so we be very surprised to see we son have such a difficult time with the game . the reason why he be have a hard time with it be not because it be difficult to control - on the contrary , it be very easy . it be because it be the type of game where you really need to take you time . epic Mickey be not a `` rush through and finish it out to win it '' game , but be , rather , truly a epic adventure . you get to be Mickey in a entirely new -lrb- or old , depend on how you look at it -rrb- world , where he need not only to save himself , but to help many other . the game change depend on how you play it . if you help out a lot of people , for instance , they 'll be there to lend you a hand when you may need it . or you can skip help other and can just rush through the game yourself , but if you do this the game be a bit more difficult . pro - the control . you get to run around and paint and thin thing . how much fun be that ? grant you can not paint or thin everything , but there be a large number of thing that you can paint and thin , and what you choose to do change the way the land around you look , truly personalize the game . - the sheer size of it . it be huge . it be a game where you can run all over the place and still not see everything , much like Disney World itself . - the sentiment . we just get back from Disney and see some of the same thing , like `` mean '' street and the Disney statue , be so sentimental for I . and watch Mickey 's animated face when he see Walt 's statue - priceless ! con - the camera control - you do not have full , complete camera control like you do in some game , and I can see where that would be frustrate to some people . to I , however , it be just another challenge to the game , and it do not bother I too badly . epic Mickey be a great game - not the easiest game , but definitely great . it actually get emotion out of I whenever one of the character be unremembered by Mickey , and when they talk about be forget about by the world . any video game that can not only challenge you and intrigue you , but also make you feel emotion , be a good one to I .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I have enjoy all the other game but the folk on this line be correct ... it be terrible . I spend six hour try different way to configure it to work without success . the character sometimes move and cast spell and then they just stand there . I have a friend who also have it and have the same problem . since they make the money I be sure they do not care , but this game be something that should be replace with something that work . this will be the last one that I buy and I be over 60 but young at heart .
Video_Games	POS	4	my daughter and I be huge Broadway fan and really enjoy play just Dance so we be eagerly await Dance on Broadway . at first , I be a bit offput by the relatively bad rating compare to just Dance . I think this be because it be a different kind of dancing . instead of the frenetic movement of just Dance , most of these song be a lot slower and require more measure and control movement . also , the game be not as sensitive and have a less refined score system . as for the graphic , there be not any trouble for we to see the dance . the outfit be also kind of cute on the avatar , and it be a welcome change . I also think it be a pretty good aerobic workout if you be willing to move you foot and actually follow the dance ! if you do not move you foot , yes , you will probably will not get as intense a workout as you would with just Dance . 4\/5 because you always want more song .
Video_Games	POS	5	I buy this for my 5 and 7 year old girl , and we have 5 boy between 4 and 8 at we house and all of they love this game . very fun and aerobic , and all the adult love it too . I recommend it ! Great for family night !
Video_Games	POS	4	try to control the plane with you computer keyboard can be very difficult . other than that the game be totally awesome . all though I think they make the flight control a little more flimsy which can account for make it hard to control some of the plane in the game . even with these setback , I love Microsoft Flight Sim 2004 . the detail be more realistic than other version of the Flight Simulator . I take off from the Salt Lake City international airport and actually manage to land a 737 on the landing strip in Las Vegas . the 737 be my favorite plane because once you up in the air , you can put the plane into autopilot and sit to enjoy the view . have read the flight manual for the Boeing 737 , I can say that all the control be right where they suppose to on the plane . I also like to set the weather to thunderstorm . I find it more interesting to see lighting storm go on under I when I be 35,000 foot up ! if you look into take fly lesson this game will defiantly reminder you , there be a lot more to fly than just get the plane up in the air . Flight Simulator 2004 will give you a sure opportunity to fine tune you fly skill .
Video_Games	POS	5	first let I just say that I be very bias towards MGS , its my favorite series . also I buy my PS3 at launch for this game alone , but still I have to say that this be the close to perfection than any other video game in history . first let start with the greatest part of mss4 , the story , simply put , it answer every question a fan could ask . its one of the greatest story of any media . next the graphic , true they be some game with better graphic , but the environment and everything go together perfectly . the sound in this game be unbeleiveable , its so realistic , and the soundtrack can rival the Halo series . finally game play , this be probably the most satisfying game I every play , epic boss fight to the in game battle that rage on the battle field , its so awesome . in my opinion if you have a PS3 than you owe it to yourself to play this game , and if you do not go to a friend -lrb- or make a friend -rrb- with a PS3 .
Video_Games	POS	5	if you be go to buy a Dreamcast , you should probably make this you first game . very fun and fast gameplay , and interesting storyline . you explore in huge area call adventure stage to find action sage , where you destroy enemy and complete one of the three objective . the first one ussually be to get to the end of the stage , second , do that with 50 ring usually , and third , complete the stage in the time limit . this , of course , be as Sonic . there be 5 other character to unlock along the way with different objective for the stage . also , there be a virtual pet part that you can feed they and do other thing , then put the on you memory unit to play with separately . this provide hour of fun . the graphic in this game be stunning , and the music be awesome and set the mood in the stage . this be a great game .
Video_Games	NEU	3	this game be great in many respects . it be a follow up to Mount & Blade , what I feel be the best medieval mount fight semi-rpg of all time . that say , it be a lot to live up to . Mount & Blade Warband fall short of the original and have a lot of bug -lrb- lot ! -rrb- . it appear the developer tweak the game in favor of multiplayer mode and fail to deliver on the single player aspect , forget to expand on the rpg element and to make the world believable . if you be into multiplayer , you be in for a treat . if not , then you may want to wait until the price drop down to $ 9.99 or until more patch be release to fix the bug , or the mod community have have a chance to release some interesting work to play . some of the notable bug I be see : \* - random rainbow artifact with the graphic when roam around the tavern \* - random graphic glitching during combat \* - nerfing of the couch lance ; it be nearly impossible now to be a lancer \* - nerfing of archer ; it be near impossible to hit anyone with a bow or crossbow , even when aim for expose body part , especially when you be on horseback \* - a bug where if you repeatedly re-assign the marshall role to any other lord under you , you relationship with the other increase ridiculously dramatically \* - after a battle , the battle summary that come up be miss the name of the soldier that die or be wound all in all , this game be not ready for prime time . I think it should have be in beta much longer . fortunately , Taleworlds be great at release fix and patch for customer . if you do make the mistake of buy it early and find the problem too annoying , hang on to you copy until the problem be fix or until the modding community have complete a few mod . this be easily the best modding game out there .
Video_Games	POS	5	the game be fun . pure and simple . the bunny be amusing and the fly dragon take concentration and work . the ice slide be outstanding and , again , take patience . if the game be too easy , people would complain ... if it be too hard ... people will complain . bottom line be - you can not please they all . but the way they make the character switch be a good , solidly easy play . I be look forward to the next one . great job , guy & girl .

Video_Games	NEG	1	in many respects this sim be inferior to fs2004 . the frame rate be terrible and the aircraft viewpoint too fussy to get to quickly . anyone with fs2004 and with good add on scenery I would advise to stay with it . my computer be state of the art with dual core pcu , Nvidea 7900GT graphic . over New York in fs2004 with all slider max out I get over 35 fp , with FSX I get 7 fp . with slider at normal and a slide show .

Video_Games	NEU	3	this be a amazing game , up until the point where software bug prevent the player -lrb- i.e. I -rrb- from continue the adventure . therefore , since only about 2\/3rds of the game be available for I to play I rate it no greater than 2\/3rds of the maximum . I 'll just mention the bug without use any spoiler . you 'll eventually encounter a cavern that you must enter and do something , but if you save after enter this cavern and then restart a confirm glitch in the game will prevent you from ever leave . I be incredibly disgusted with this situation and be not yet do deal with Nintendo because they solution be to start over from scratch or from a earlier save record if one be available . if I have it to do over again I would wait for a second release of this game , like a `` Player 's Choice '' release because it be likely that will contain a update build of the game with bug fix . you may also want to consider the Gamecube build because I have read account where people say that the bug be fix for the Gamecube release . this situation and other that I recently have have with Nintendo product have seriously dent the reputation for quality that the company use to have .
Video_Games	POS	5	well , first I buy the Sims Deluxe with 1 expansion and that get old after a while but now that I have this with all the expansion I dont know if it could get boring . there be so much to do now like adopt pet and go downtown . the possibility be endless !

Video_Games	POS	5	great game . graphic : the graphic have greatly improve since the original Halo . the bump-mapping have do a great deal for the game . throw a plasma grenade on the ground and watch the lighting effect . 10\/10 SOUND : I love the sound in this game , great music , and great sound effect . my only complaint be that the warthog sound less `` scary '' and the smg sound more like fully-auto cap gun instead of real gun . but other than that the sound be great . 9.7 \/ 10 gameplay : fun ! I love the new addition of dual weilding . I also like the way that you can board and enemy vehicle . these be just a couple of the many thing that have greatly add to the already fun gameplay of HALO . 10\/10 story -lrb- no spoiler -rrb- : good story . there have be many complaint about the end ... but I think the story be very immersive . I love it . although the end be slightly dissapointing . 9.8 \/ 10 MULTIPLAYER : in Halo this be one of the main attraction . in Halo 2 multiplayer could have make a game . its incredibly fun and addicting . now with the new addition of live you can play with new or old friend while on completely different continent . Multiplayer be what help make this game what it be ... a great game . 10\/10 VALUE : Definatly a game that will keep you occupy for year . 10\/10 OVERALL : Halo 2 leave I completely breathless ... well , it leave I with enough breath to say `` damn !

Video_Games	NEU	3	fable be a game that aim way too high and have no chance of do anything but come up short of gamer ' expectation . yes , it be a good game . yes , it be worth playing . no , it be probably not worth buying , nor be it as deep and realistic as its creator profess . the game be short . I beat it in 12 hour and that include a fair amount of screw around . this be unacceptable consider it be developer claim that fable would be the greatest rpg ever make . the game be easy . if you be good at videogame , you will find this game easy . they say you can `` boast '' to make you mission harder , and while this can make indiviual mission tougher , it be not enough to make the overall game experience more difficult . the good\/evil idea be a good \* idea \* . implement it in a way that be satisfy to the player have yet to be achieve by any game and it would appear we have a long way to go . ca not really blame the developer for try but the morality element be painfully two-dimensional . the action be good . combat be fun and addictive . there be a good amount of skill and powerup to choose from when spend you experience , but again , the extremely short length of the game make all you careful experience spending feel waste . the story blow . take a stereotype fairytale and take away a few hour and you have fable 's story . the game be novel at first . it trick you . but as you play more you see that , at best , fable be a good action\/adventure game : not the ultimate good\/evil rpg that some have hope for . Rent it .

I use it almost constantly , and , in the spirit of `` Tron '' I use it the entire time I be play the game . the controller be of the quality one would expect from XBox , and the light make a great conversation piece when you friend come over for game day . as for the game `` Tron : Legacy '' , well ... I would give it a 8 out of 10 . although I will be leave a review of the game when I purchase it , -lrb- I use Gamefly for my rental -rrb- I will leave some quick feedback here as well . the graphic be awesome , the control be simple enough to master , and the puzzle be engage , and yes , sometimes even a little frustrating . the most glaring fault with the game be all the jump . thankfully , fall to you death do not set you back to badly . although some of the jump be a aggravation when try to master they . and those be only the one that require flawless execution . as a long time fan of `` Tron '' and the original arcade game -lrb- which I would own if I could find one -rrb- I find that the new movie and corresponding game stay true to the spirit of the original movie . one of the few game I have find that do not suck after see the movie , and the controller just add to the legacy . a must have for collector !

I do not know why people complain about the wiimote and nunchuck , because I think they be quite compatible as controller . the graffic be terrific as be the storyline , and if you be not use cheat , the game be just difficult enough to keep you interested , but not so difficult that it drive you nut and you give up , and chuck the wiimote at you poor hdtv . I really love the little village ; they be so quaint and charming -lrb- you have guess it ; I be a chick -rrb- ! the only thing that I dislike about the game be the end : you can not go back and free-play after the grand finale . -lrb- I be hope to return to the cute little village and make Link & Zelda `` create '' little sword-and-shield-yielding baby ! ; -rrb- ha ! -rrb- unfortunately , this kind of end be typical of Zelda game . why oh why ???

I like to buy my point through amazon because I have have issue with xbox live when I give they my credit card number . on multiple occasion , Xbox live have lock my account because of the point I purchase from they -lrb- if you choose to buy directly on xbox live , it be better to buy once large sum of point -- the xbox fraud unit lock the account if there be multiple small purchase -rrb- . unlock the account involve wait up to a week and multiple phone call to xbox live support . while I appreciate they security , I prefer to avoid the hassle . the 4000 point card allow you to buy many item on xbox live . most arcade game range from about 800 point to 1200 point . add-on range from about 160 point -lrb- for Rock Band song -rrb- to 1600 point for very-large add-on . its a good denomination because it last for several week . there be some great xbox live `` arcade '' game . many xbox 360 game offer additional character , level , mission , and other add-on material that can make a great game even better . but xbox point can be use for more than just game add-on . Xbox live offer movie , music , and avatar item . everything you buy on xbox live be save in you download history . so even if you delete it to make room in you hard drive , it be available to be download again . personally , I find xbox point to be a great investment that allow I to unlock the game I purchase for many additional hour of play . for you entertainment dollar , expand you favorite game be win proposition .
Video_Games	POS	5	I must say , I spend a good two month decide on what headphone to buy for my xbox360 . I finally decide on the Turtle Beach x41 .

I have have the headset for a few week now . I do not know if it have improve my gaming in black op , it be a bit overwhelming at first . hearing every bullet , bug in the air , music playing be a amazing . I actually think I be experience feedback on Grid in Black op ... but it be simply the fact that my team spawn in domination next to the power station . the buzz be something I have never hear before even with my surround sound speaker . I have the receiver set right on top of my 360 with 1st generation wireless network adapter , a wireless router , and my iMac run use airport in the next room . still no feedback or interference , even use Comcast and they crazy throttling . one complaint be that the chat volume control take some fiddle to get the right volume set . first time I use it I be blow away at how loud my friend be . overall , very pleased with this purchase . so be my wife ... she do not have to hear the announcer say my killstreak over and over !
Video_Games	POS	5	word can not express how incredible this game be ! I want to start this review by come in with a bit of a background on myself . I first get into elder scroll when I hear about skyrim be release in 2011 when it be 2010 . honestly , it look great . so I pick up oblivion because I think that would give I a idea . now many may disagree with I . but I be not too impressed with oblivion . I have some fun , but I be scare a lot from explore , and the main quest with the oblivion gate be terrifying . I put in many 10 hour into that game before I call it quit . so when skyrim first come out . I wait just a bit to hear about . I be then fortunate enough to get it as a Christmas gift and even the first scene just blow I away . for return fan , this have -lrb- for I at least -rrb- every aspect of oblivion that I do like , and everything else be near perfection . this game be the most true to a rpg theme than any other . from the start you can truly do whatever you want , whenever you , however you want , as whoever you want . the race create a great mix of culture and dispute , with different benefit and like to you character . the universe be immense and you completely fall into this beautiful world of conflict and distress . the most amazing thing . if you pick up this game , you have just pick up at least 50 hour of entertainment . over the course of 3-4 month . I have play over 100 hour of this game . it be mind blowing . how be a game capable of such a defeat ? the quest be great , and you do not even have to do the main quest if you do not want , and the guild quest will be just as intense and lengthy as the main quest , so you have plenty of fun . every skill be improve base off how you use it . be you into stealth ? sneak around , pick lock and pocket and you will get better as you go . more of a brute ? collect heavy armor and some strong weapon and take the enemy 's head on and become the strongest man\/woman in skyrim . it have a adaptional feature , so it really customize the game to you liking . and you can even build you own weapon and armor with the smithing skill . and for the first time magic be as strong as the other lifestyle . so you can finally live as a mage if you like magic . and learn at a college ! it be phenomenal ! if you a fan of medival castle age or fantasy , you could not ask for a better game . it be simplly perfect . on a scale to 1-10 I would give it a 9.8 and the only reason it be not perfect , be because there be a few bug . I have not experience as many as there supposedly be . but I can not ignore they , and for that reason it be not a perfect ten . but it be as close as one can get . it be a very open world game , and rumor have it that a expansion pack like dlc be to come soon that may even open up the old word of morrowind or cyrodill -lrb- previously release title in the series with a new gen touch -rrb- which I be unbelievably excite for . I can not stress enough how amazing this game be . even if it do not sound like you kind of game because of violence or quest , just try it , and see for yourself , because you want be able to drop it once you try it !
Video_Games	POS	4	the game be fun . there be no doubt about that . it probably appeal to the younger audience , hence the e rating . I find it to be clever . it follow the storyline of the movie but be able to deviate in appropriate way . for example when Buzz be navigate through a room , it may switch to he fly through space . it be as if he be get play with , use a child 's imagination just like the movie . the game incorporate the touch pad intermittently so there be a good mix of the control . you can unlock level for free play by collect the pixar ball . my biggest criticism be that it be not challenging , but I think it be appropriate for the younger gamer . by add the free play , it be good for replay value .
Video_Games	POS	4	if you go to a U.S. elementary school in the ninety , chance be you play this game . this version be exactly how I remember the old game from my grade school day . hard work and creative design reward you with success in the game . Poor design and poor planning lead to failure . and let not forget that if you get bore , you can build roller coaster to no where that send people fly to they explosive death . could this game be any greater for a grade school kid ? play this game year later be entertaining , even addictive . the objective of the game usually revolve around obtain a certain park rating and a certain number of guest . often time , these objective can be complete with a lot of time to spare , and it can be pretty bore to just sit around wait out the clock . one thing that be sometimes annoying about this game be that you must use the CD while play the game . this would not be a big deal , but sometimes as you be play the game , you will start scroll to another part of a game level and the game will momentarily freeze . it will freeze for 5 seconds or so while the CD spin up and provide the necessary information . I wish the CD rom would just load all of the necessary file onto my hard drive so I would not have to deal with delay . but it be a minor issue , and the game be still enjoyable . for some add fun , you can look up cheat for the game online . many of they involve re-naming guest in the amusement park and they will do certain thing , include wave , painting , take picture , etc. . some cheat will even make the go-kart drive faster . if you be look for a game to take you back to you younger day or you simply want to instill the capitalistic value in you child\/spouse\/video game play pet Roller Coaster Tycoon be the way to go .

I would recommend this game for anybody who like adventure and level type fantasy game without all the blood and gut . it be also a really great game for kid as there be no profanity or anything of the like involve .

Video_Games	POS	5	roller coaster tycoon be a game that you build you own theme park . it might look boring , but once you start play it , it be very fun and creative . this game 's get lot 's of cool ride like corkscrew rollercoaster , inverted coaster , swine ship and gravitron and more . and there be lot of mild ride and shop like car ride , space ring , gift shop and pizza . this game be creative be because you can almost do what you want to do in this game . for example , you can make a vertical loop go through a vertical loop when you build a rollercoaster . but there be also some problem . you have only two kind of objective in this and that be makeing guest come two you park and increase park vaule . this might make the game boring but you have to accomplish these objective in different park situation . like you have lot trash in you park or something like that . I give this game 5 star because it , s very creative and with a little imagination you can build a park that even you be go to be suprised !

Video_Games	POS	5	the best adventure\/puzzle game I have ever play . the graphic be state-of-the-art and the story line be very original and most intriguing . the puzzle be challenge enough to make you think , but lack the frustration I have encounter with other game . it be a nice relaxing game with the appeal of a great novel , except I get tire of Dan and Olivia -lrb- two minor character -rrb- . I agree with some of the other review that the end be slightly abrupt . I want to see a full-size automaton mammoth . hopefully there will be a sequel continue Kate 's journey .
Video_Games	POS	4	I buy this , it work great for literally 20 minute , then it stop work . manage to get it work again after mess around with the driver and now it work perfectly fine . for the hassle I go through to make it work , its worth the price , you just might have to play with it a bit to get it work .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I could not wait to buy this game , but now I be go to . the DRM be reprehensible and I will not purchase until it be go .
Video_Games	POS	5	this version do not use the nunchuk . yay ! I have give up on game that use the nunchuk so this be a great change . the workout be vigorous , and there be some new fun activity that make you forget how much you be squat and jump . I agree with other who say that it be irritating that the remote and balance board lose contact and have to be turn back on even though they be not use for most activity .
Video_Games	NEG	1	when I first play this game at my friend 's house , I be astounded by the magnificent graphic and gameplay . WOW -- be unlike any other video game I have ever play in my life . I just admire the Worgen so much that I quickly become obsess with interest ; however , I keep wonder why my friend would pay ninety-five dollar and a fifteen dollar fee each month for Cataclysm . so week pass by after New year day and that be when I discover a advirtisement of the game from Amazon . I check the video , picture etc. . I soon realize that my interest be short live , when I learn that I would have to pay for all four game as a whole -lrb- just for the one game -rrb- . not to mention the fifteen dollar monthly fee for a battle.net account . the entire expansion set have a staggering , one-hundred dollar price tag . that be not all . if you do not have the right computer , it will cost you one-thousand buck or more for a Mac ! as a blizzard consumer I would suggest that you try they free 10 day trial offer , pick out one you favorite character and make it jump off a cliff ... why ? because it make absolutely no sense to pay for something so expensive . I be very disappointed and unsatisfied . no offense ; I apologize . but as a reasonable gamer I choose to not buy this game until the price be fair . this item be obviously more of a luxury than a game that be why I give up on purchase it .
Video_Games	POS	5	i have the original gta4 at first , but when i see this go on sale , i decide to splurge as well as use my promotional credit from before to grab this at a steal -lrb- around $ 16 -rrb- . even if it be at full price i would have still be happy come with gta4 , the lose and the damned , and the ballad of gay Tony , all on the one disc . the only trouble i can see be that each section need to be install on the PS3 . overall though , a great package .
Video_Games	NEG	2	I pick this up instead of the new medal of honor . the guy at Gamestop say it blow away mw2 and the new MOH . oh how wrong be he . First off , I be a very big campaign player . I play online sometimes when I get bore , but mostly I be into the campaign . mw2 's story line be far better than this one , yeah the campaign be cool and have its twist and turn but it be sub par in my opinion . I have see much better . graphic be good , but not great , a couple new weapon and feature be add that help out some . I be not go to spoil anything in the story for those of you who want to try it . online play be typical COD , more like WAW than MW though . it really would have be nice to see they do something longer and stop concentrate so much on the online ply . i understand that be where the money be at , but some people like both world . the only nice addition be the extra zombie game option , but its just like World at War game play wise so if you have WAW , save you money . instead of spending so much money on advertising this game with Kobe and Jimmy , they should have put it into the game . I can not believe I buy this . I be head to Gamestop now to trade in this so call great first person shooter . long story short , I should have buy medal of honor .
Video_Games	POS	5	this computer game have a such a wonderful environment to explore ! I wish there be more of it ! the 3-d animated character be a nice improvement over the 2-d animation in `` secret can kill '' . the puzzle be fun , and the game play be addictive . this game be a little bit tougher than the last game ... you really have to hunt for those clue . `` Stay Tuned '' be perfect for anyone who love a good mystery . it be a refreshing alternative to the blood , gore and evil in the popular software game today . I highly recommend it .
Video_Games	POS	5	I purchase another controller think it charge two of the normal PS3 controller and two move controlelr -- but it only charge one move and one nav controller . this one will charge 4 of any combination of move or nav controller . I also believe it hold they better than my other controller , provide positive feedback as to the charge status -lrb- and when it be do -rrb- and have a power button -lrb- my other one do not and thus be always drain electricity -rrb- .
Video_Games	POS	5	when Bungie announce that they be make Halo 2 , a lot of people think that they be just fix up the original one and add thing . Bungie then inform the public that it be build it all over again and this be much more than just a re-make . the game design and control be identical to the original , while the graphic be bump up a few notch . the texture take a few seconds to load sometimes mid cut-scene , but it be a improvement . you can definately tell the same people design the level in this game that do the last , as there be one or two that be pretty redundant and stretch probably longer than they need to . but overall , this game have many new thing to offer . First off , duel weilding weapon . you can still only store one weapon that you be not use , but the current one , if it be hold by one hand , can leave room for you to pick up another one handed weapon . in this case , you can fire both simultaniously or in whatever combination you want -lrb- alternate and such -rrb- because you right trigger control you right weapon , and leave trigger now control the left one -lrb- as oppose to the grenade , like normal -rrb- . this add much to the game on its own . second , you have a plethora of new weapon to play with . the covenant arsenal have be expand exponentially , and you can now wield the energy sword -lrb- a new favorite , as you could imagine -rrb- . you also get the fuel rod projector , which be the big gun that be graft onto the arm of the hunter - the covenant equivalent to the rocket launcher . it have a covenant equivalent to a sniper rifle , and a carbine also . Third , you can hi-jack vehicle . this be a major plus , but definately a skill to be learn and master . this will make multiplayer much more interesting . also , you can climb on enemy tank , pop the cover open , and drop a grenade in there to cook the pilot without waste a rocket like you have to before . fourth , the story be much more complex . there be more cutscene , and another goodie that be leave out of the previous review -lrb- or at least the one I have read -rrb- . while the story do not flow nearly as easily as the last game , there be essentially two story happen simultaneously . I be guess the story will combine later -lrb- I be only halfway through now -rrb- , but beside the one with the Master Chief , you play the Arbitor in the other . you be the disgraced elite that be in charge of the fleet in the first game . you failure to bring the Master Chief down and preserve the Halo have bring you much pain , and the suicidal position of the Arbitor . you play alongside the Covenant military as he , and run mission against Covenant rebel and other thing . this give much exposure into how the Covenant work and develop they much more so than the last game . two variation to the original classic weapon must be note . the pistol do not have a scope on it anymore , which will definately balance multiplayer game by limit those head-shot guru who never fight up close . also , the previous Assault Rifle , with its automatic fire and 60 round magazine be long go . in its place be the battle Rifle , with a 2x scope , but only a three round burst fire mode , and a 32 shoot magazine . sadly enough , take elite out with that be much harder because you can not bum-rush they while empty you magazine . the three round burst definetly slow down the effectiveness of the rifle in short range combat , which be probably why they introduce the sub machine gun , which be a high rate of fire , caseless , one handed weapon . of course , now you have to have both of they for the same advantage you have with the single Assault Rifle before , but it be a minor setback . I do not have access to XBOX Live where I be at currently , but I be sure this will be one of the greatest live experience to date . I know how much fun the orinigal game be in multiplayer , so this one , with its improvement , will be much better . all in all , the developer have make a game with the same addictive attribute of Halo , but with much more replayability , mass multiplayer option , and enough improvement to fill a football stadium . all of the other fpss I have will have to take a backseat to this . there be just nothing that can compete .
Video_Games	POS	5	this game be unlike the other . it be a lot more fun and interesting ! you start out in a train where all the student have something to say . you be already battle monster and explore the train . after that you start lesson and you get to be all the character ! you do so many thing and a lot of it you can do over and over . so buy the game , pleasant encounter await you !

Video_Games	POS	5	this be a great color gaming system that broght the fun of most of the game of sega 's genisis to a pocket version . the color graphic blow away any of it be competition at the time -lrb- except for the 16bit atarus lynx system , highly overlook -rrb- , and should have lay waiste to the gameboy , except for the marketing and pricing . it be tough to believe that the survivor from this time period be the gameboy . this be family friendly , still readily available and with many title in most use gaming store . very well worth look at and buy for younger kid that may not be ready for a psp . this have a few more maturer game for the pre-teens as well , so they can continue to devlop they interest beyond bubble bobble and kirby -lrb- even though bubble bobble be excellet , a classic -rrb- . Worth look at .
Video_Games	POS	4	although this expansion add MUCH NEEDED detail , it be not what it could be , especially for the money . although there be a few skill and a cool town to explore ... I be still look for a expansion with weather ! : -lrb-
Video_Games	POS	5	the PSP be limit by have only one analog stick , and psp user know when play FPS game it become so frustrating . this game instead be a third person shooter , basically overhead , and the creator make this game as fun as it could be on the psp . you aim and shoot with the analog , you get grenade , a lot of weapon , after mission you be reward base on you performance and uncover of veteran money , basically you use this to buy more cool weapon . there be plenty of weapon , feature , mission and they include a update to bring another act with several mission as a free bonus , plus they include a update for free online play . a great package and a great psp game with a entertaining story line , fun game play and rich graphic .
Video_Games	NEU	3	my 3 kid realy enjoy each of they d 's one be buy new and two use . it be very addictive . one thing I would caustion parent about the d 's they break but not like you think . my daughter 's break on the second day she have owend it . we buy it use , so we have no idea how old it be and of course no warrenty by manufacture . my daughter give it to I to set the time and such . I do so shut it and then want to ck something open it again -lrb- this be with out sit it down -rrb- and as I open it the d 's hing crack . I do some reserch and find this be very common . so if you child hing break do not get mad at you child it be a failur flaw of the d it be self . I also strongly advise you spend the money for a screen protecter as they do get scratch up . they be fun but i feel they price be to high for they qulity . I hope this info help you in desige just how much you willing to spend for one . most game be $ 35 , - they go up to $ 50 , - but you can get they cheaper if you by use . beware of copy best way to avoid they be to buy from US seller only . please do not hold this info aginst Amazon or the seller on amazon i buy from , this be nentendo flaw not theirs .
Video_Games	POS	5	this and the final scene be my favorite . it be exciting , not too hard , not too terribly easy and a lot of surprise . Execept when you gotta find those damn bug I love every minute of it . no stupid puzzle -lrb- \* cough Blackmoor \* cough -rrb-
Video_Games	POS	4	excellent product . actually save a battery I be have problem with before . my battery refuse to charge , but with this , it get it right back to charge -lrb- the charge cable could have be bad , not sure -rrb- . it be small , take little space , and charge battery within hour . Great little product for the price .
Video_Games	NEU	3	as any metal Gear fan will tell you , the story and the way it be tell be just as important as anything in this game . and as the final chapter in solid Snake 's legacy , it function as the wrap up of all aspect of the story leave behind for about 20 year . and that be it be problem . after about 25 hour of sit back and listen to explanation that seem to be push into logic , I be not satisfy with my investment . it seem that the more I advance into the game , the less I play and even know how MGS game play out , I be still surprise at how little time I be get to actually have fun . I will not argue about production value or graphic and sound . this game look and sound above all else on the PS3 . but as a game , as something I would like to interact with and be a active participant in , it just do not fulfill my need .
Video_Games	POS	4	this third party battery be a perfect fit in all four of we wireless controller as well as the Microsoft fast charger . recharge time and length of useable time be similar to that of the Microsoft battery . while some reviewer have complain about battery that do not fit , I have to question why they do not send they back at that time . Amazon will exchange a defective product with free return shipping . at one third the cost of the Microsoft brand battery , these be a bargain .
Video_Games	POS	5	I would say this look good ; it seem to be add a firework show feautre , and a major game downfall be no show outside of the cinema . it should be good .
Video_Games	NEG	1	the DRM be insane . I can not even install the game to play on separate account on the same computer . they need to offer a family pack or something similar . I do not mind ` rent ' a game if the DRM scheme be reasonable but what be use for spore make it very family unfriendly .
Video_Games	POS	4	sadly , I have no broadband . therefore , i can not enjo what be probably the best part of this game . however , I have play the campaign , and i can tell you it be a little disapointing . the plot be dumb , and the charactor be thin . through out the entire game , the only threat to you be enemy mech , which pop up more often later , but during the begining it be just point and shoot . the strong point of this game be in the control scheme and the enviornment . almost everything be destroyable , form building to stone pillar and the local fauna . overall , i would only give this game 3 star . but i be allow for benefit of the doubt with the multiplayer thing , and give it 4 .
Video_Games	NEU	3	DaGeDar be a game where you control a DaGeDar steel ball and have it roll through a course . it actually remind I of Sonic the hedgehog with how you control the ball through loop and as you pass through item . you can receive Energy Chargers that refill you Turbo meter so you can go at turbo speed and fly through the air from a cannon . there be other boost and of course patch to slow you down or even eat up you ball so you have to start over . the game include 3 Championship Leagues , 7Zones , and 100 DaGeDar ball to unlock . you have to keep playing -lrb- racing -rrb- to get better speed and slowly you will unlock more and more of the game . so while the game be very easy to play , the challenge be to keep play to unlock more level and ball and get better time . my 3 year old love this game , that be how easy it be for he - now of course he have a horrible time and be not use Turbo or anything , but he be able to beat the level . for older kid it be the challenge of unlock everything and even compete against friend ! we only have one d otherwise I be sure my boy would love to race each other ! oh and the basic level and option you have in the beginning be okay but they definitely get cooler as the game go on !
Video_Games	POS	5	this have the control and proper feel of a xbox controller and I use this for my pc . I like not have to worry about battery . have a long cord that be the right length . a excellent purchase for a pc gamer like myself who do not need a controller all the time .
Video_Games	NEG	1	take a page from Stardock 's playbook - no drm - treat you customer as they deserve .
Video_Games	POS	5	I buy this Wii bundle after covet my friend 's for a couple of year . out of the box , I be play in five minute . the Sports Resort have so many fun game , my favorite be Frisbee golf and speed slice -lrb- swordfighting -rrb- and the whole concept have come a long way since my last console , a n64 back in the late 90 . the graphic be mind-boggling , play nhl2k10 , I think I be actually at Joe Louis Arena . the Wii remote plus sens you movement and that control the game , it be ton of fun . so far I have purchase a  Wii Remote Plus - Pink  who say video game be just for kid ?!?
Video_Games	NEU	3	these controller be great but some require some work . I have bough 3 . 1 come perfect out of the box . 1 I have to open and realign the dpad and one of the shoulder button . 1 the right shoulder board be smaller than the place for it so I hot glue it into place . these work excellent but the manufacturing leave something to be desire .
Video_Games	POS	5	I have not play a battlefield game since bf2 on the pc . I have switch over to the call of duty series over the last few year and love they . I read some of the glowing review for bf3 and decide to give it a shot and have not be disappoint . I recommend download the hd graphic -lrb- which clock in at around 2gb -rrb- . they be great and they make you feel more immerse in you surroundings . I know people have complain about it take up hdd space , but there be only so much you can fit on a dvd . if you have the 250gb console , this should not be a problem . my only complaint with the game be : 1 - you can not customize you class in between round . I find this annoying because I end up adjust my kit during time I should be play in a round . be it the end of the world , no. . it be something that can be fix though . 2 - not be able jump out of the server you be currently on while in between round . at the end of a round you have to wait until the next round begin before you can quit you current server to join a new one . it take about a minute or so to switch in between map . again a minor complaint but one that can be fix in the future I be sure . I try go back to mw3 but find the run & gun pace a bit play out . I like the `` slower '' pace of bf3 , as well as the xp point bonus -lrb- like give ammo to or reviving\/healing -rrb- you get from interact with you assign squadmate -lrb- if you join one -rrb- . the destructible environment bring another level of play in . tank & rocket can take out wall , car & tree . finally , the weapon customization rock in this game . so many option to choose from . from tactical flashlight , bipod , IR scope to foregrip & underbarrel launcher . this be a must own title !
Video_Games	POS	5	first time play both these game , I enjoy they very much . GOW I be simply amazing with Pandora 's temple . very well do . GOW II be a great game but loose some of the luster that GOW I have . however , GOW II do prepare you for the highly anticipate gowiius -lrb- which I can not wait for -rrb- . either way , this be a steal . two great , great game at a reasonable price . enjoy .
Video_Games	NEG	2	I receive this game as a gift and find it to be time consuming but not that great . First off , you have to go back to board you have already be to like a hundred time , which really eat my patience ... secondly it be a bit vague as to which way i be suppose to go and how to get there . it be ok if you like a loooonnng game , but i be more of the super mario brother type ...
Video_Games	NEU	3	the game might be worth 4 star out of 5 . for most people it be probably great . let 's start with the UI . it be okay . not great but okay . the kinect really kind require different menu 's than something like the Wii - option have to be bigger and they should not be close to each other since it be way to easy to select something wrong with it if they be . and the icon need to be self explanatory . unfortunately this program do not follow those guideline very well . the UI be perfectly serviceable after you get use to it , do not get I wrong ... but be ready to select a lot of thing wrong until then use the Kinect . onto the workout . they be not too bad . I be okay with they and I be certain that the person that this title be aim at will be very tired when get do with a session . on the other hand I have be do daily workout with the Wii Fit for three year , ea Sports active for about 1.5 year and the gym for a year . I be not in that category and so I barely sweat ... at least as far as the program have go so far - it may very well get harder as I go . on the other hand , I love the tech - the body scan be useful . and the ability to control the program as you be work out with you voice be just plain cool . the program offer good feedback as you work out that be appropriate to the movement you be make . so for the right person this be a 4\/5 star . for I it be a 3\/5 .
Video_Games	POS	5	this game be go to be so cool because I love the other Roller Coaster Tycoon game . I wish you could be a customer in somebody 's park and you could pick on what ride you want to go on and then ride they . but I be glad this game be come out becuase I will be play it all day ! it will rock !
Video_Games	POS	4	as a electronically inclined college student who do review for store that sell this console , own one , and can actually afford to keep it interesting , I can tell you this much . the ps2 be a very advanced -lrb- consumer wise -rrb- gaming system that can keep the right person amuse for several hour . it do a little more than the other gaming system -lrb- for instance , it be dvd ready , play the game of it be predecessor , have both exensive brand name and not so expensive generic addition , and have a bigger and possibly better reputation -rrb- .  it also tend to get costly , as do the other system . my point here be that while you can certainly just buy one of these system -lrb- ps2 , gamecube , xbox ... or even the new gameboy -rrb- you should make note of the other option . for example : most of these system will run for about the same amount . however , there be downside .  the ps2 be dvd ready and the game ... well , there be more than you can shake a stick at . and if you buy they at the right time the price do not allow for buyer 's remorse . in this particular case I would have to say that if you have play with the original playstation and still have the game then the system be worth the cost .  however Nintendo fan should know that the Gamecube have the right competative edge to go up against the ps2 . it be light , the game be on minidisc , the graphic be plenty better than the n64 , and the controller be pretty much a game player dream come true . yet the game be slightly limited and still a bit expensive .  as for the xbox , I do not know all that much . I think I get too tired of microsoft computer game to bother purchase a separate console to play with . it be dvd ready like the ps2 . it have internal memory and networking capability and like I say I be a electronics kinda person . I just find it strange that I can buy a computer game for say $ 40 or I can purchase a gaome console for the same price that I pay for the ps2 and then go buy the game for that instead .  as a odd little end note : I think that the Xbox 's controller be a tad awkward . it be rather like a morph version of a ps2 and Gamecube controller . after say 25 minute of play a game on it you hand might start to feel quite exhaust . the reason may have something to do with the overall shape . like I say ... morph version .
Video_Games	POS	5	this be a great product that my 4 year old son love . he really like car , especially race car . this product have a number of fun and educational activity to do before Putt Putt can enter the race . my son love the race at the end , but he never rush through the activity , because he have such a good time do they as well . he particularly like have to go to the garden maze and find different fruit and veggy . I would highly recommend this product .
Video_Games	POS	5	we play this game yesterday at a friend 's house with a group of 5 kid who range in age from 3-12 . they all have a great time and burn off a lot of energy ! the gameplay be easy , the team play mode be great , and the kid have lot of silly fun . it be my first time play one of the just Dance game , and I will definitely be purchase the other just Dance game for I and my older kid , because we would prefer the song by the real artist . for people with younger kid , this game be fantastic fun .
Video_Games	POS	5	awesome , lot of content , great game , come with stand and 6 ar card . this game provide you with hour of diverse gameplay . at the beginning of each level you get to fit then you attack on the ground . you get to fuse weapon . this be the best 3d game ever !
Video_Games	NEG	1	I be excite to get this unit so that I would not have to always change out which system I have hook up in my little office on my little tv . the system work great , mostly . although I do notice some glitch , it be good enough to say that it be justify in price . good thing there be controller port for each system that work , because the include wireless one simply do not work . neither of they . at all . period . I be pretty tick off about that as it show they have no quality control whatsoever . I decide to return it and try again hope I get a work set . I might come back and post a follow up if the next set works\/doesn ' t work .
Video_Games	POS	4	I get this game on the first day . I be so excited since i love the first one -lrb- except for the final drive mission -rrb- . it be gameplaywise it have really evolve , which be a good thing . you can now jack the covenant vehicle with `` right timing '' . also they get rid of the health meter , another good thing . all in all i love it . but that doa not mean it be perfect . Let 's move on ahead to the `` not so good '' part . there be a lot of glitch in the fmv sequence of the game . some object pop in & out . and , `` why would i wanna play as a arbiter ? '' . that part totally bum I out .
Video_Games	POS	5	I love this game ! ice Cap be REALLY cool , along with Twinkle Park . when you enter Twinkle Park , you have to get in a bumper car and drive down a long but fun road . it have ton of loop and hairpin curve ... drool . and the ending of Ice Cap be cool , where you have to snowboard down the mountain to avoid a avalanche and then skid down and grab the Emerald on you way . the Storyline : Sonic be return to Station Square after a long journey and run across a liquid monster name Chaos . you have to fight he , and he turn into a puddle and slip down the sewer . then he be at the beach and see tail in he new plane , out of control . you have to get through Emerald Coast to save he . tail show Sonic a Purple Chaos Emerald -lrb- if they be emerald , why be just the Ice Cap one green ? O. o -rrb- and tell he it be the power source of he new plane . then he tell Sonic to meet he at he shop in the Mystic ruin . sonic arrive , but he be stop by Robotnik and have to fight he . I forget the rest , but at one point you have to fight Knuckles . when you be Amy , the end be pretty sad : e-102 die and the bird 's family fly away with the bird .  Chao : the Chao , also know as a-life , be little blue and green coo thing that remind many sonic fan of Tamagotchi . you have to feed they and let they sleep . you 'll notice that when you attack a enemy in a Action Stage , a animal inside a green bubble float out . grab the animal , and when you go to the Chao Garden the animal you collect will fly out . hold one up to a Chao and after glowing green , it 'll get a characteristic of the animal . only animal that have spark fly from they do this , though . if you give you Chao enough animal , -lrb- 20 once , 50 the second time . -rrb- it 'll sit down and form a white cocoon around it . the cocoon will fade and the Chao will look different and be a different color . if you Chao be limp or if you hurt it a lot , it will make a cocoon and die .  so , all in all , this game rule !
Video_Games	POS	4	battlefield 3 be a great game , but not without its shortcoming . First off , the campaign . in the beginning , I be originally concern that it be copy black op , but as other have say , this i impossible because black op be release about a year ago . the only thing battlefield 3 have in common be that the main character 's be interrogate and the campaign go through flashback mission . there be nothing else in common . the mission be fun , and it be all a plausible scenario , give the state of Iran right now . campaign be not solid , but it be not extremely bad . Multiplayer be , however , the strong suite . there be massive map , destructible building , and vehicle aplenty . the ranking system go a little quickly if you play too much but that be not a bad thing . Tactical flashlight be extremely frustrating , though , as a warning . there be unfortunately people online who camp and use other n00bish tactic , but do not worry about they , explosive always take care of those annoying failure . the serve be mostly fine , though ea and dice charge people who buy use copy of the game , which can be annoying to those who frequent Gamestop . it lag sometimes , though this can be forgive , see as how gigantic the map be . there be not a large selection of map , and play a lot make they get old , though not as fast as one may think . back to karkand release in December , so we 'll all be wait .
Video_Games	NEG	1	get a refund , as have many other . have nothing but problem with this game , and be very disappointed . I do not think they could ever fix all the bug and glitch in it if they try ! nothing like Dungeon siege 1 or 2 .
Video_Games	POS	4	I really love this game , but it feel too much like # 2 , they really do not improve a whole lot and the story be very similar . I think I actually like # 2 more so . I would say get it if you love the series , but do not be too impressed .
Video_Games	POS	5	the doom name have always be synonymous with fp -lrb- first person shooter -rrb- , so I be always amaze at how long it take ID to come out with a new iteration of the game with enhance play and graphic . let I just say that this game be worth the wait . the graphic be flawless , right down to the character 's arm hair . you can actually see realistic look dimple and razor scarring on the npc face ! I be get ahead of myself . the premise be rather straightforward . all hell break loose -lrb- no pun intend -rrb- on a top secret Martian research facility , and you character have be give the duty to set thing right . the monster be fierce and agile . the weapon be deadly . the environment be beyond spooky . my suggestion be to play this game at night with the light off and the speaker crank , and believe I , it will scare the living daylight out of you . all the weapon from the original doom be back , and look quite impressive , especially the bfg-9000 . a few extra have be add , such as hand grenade and the Soul cube . yes it can be a pain sometimes because you can not carry a flashlight and fire at the same time , force you to do without any light during critical firefight , but in my opinion that add to the horror and difficulty factor . creature aus be not that great , but let I tell you that these monster be much tougher than you remember from the original . imp can suddenly jump and strike you from 30 foot away , or even drop down from the ceiling behind you . the spider swarm you from every direction . the lose soul charge you at amazing speed from multiple direction . the gameplay can get repetetive quickly , but you heart be beat way too fast for you to even notice . with superb graphic , eery sound effect , and good playability , I say this game be a must have for any fp fan . FYI , the game run smoothly on my pc at 1024x768 at high detail with this setup : AMD Athlon xp 3000 + , 128MB Radeon 9600 pro , 1.5 gb RAM , 2x120 GB SATA strip raid .
Video_Games	NEU	3	good buy . actually third set I have purchase . they be cheaply make , but for three buck you can not beat it in my opinion .
Video_Games	POS	4	I do not have the game controller mat , but since it say it be compatible with the wius balance board , I buy it . it be fun , and a good workout , but it be pretty limit when you be use it with the balance board .
Video_Games	NEG	1	after play for a couple hour I begin to tell some friend how awesome the game be ... three hour later I have to call they all back to tell they how terrible it be . the rest of the review here be 100 % accurate . the game have absolutely no replay value ... I would go as far to say the most fun part of the game be the cell stage . f for effort !
Video_Games	POS	5	Video gaming be one of my favorite activity to do in the lazy time of the day . I be a console stud by heart and have a deep love for the console game . it be for that very reason I be very skeptical work with a video game that only work via a mouse and keyboard . worst of all there be just so many people daily who seem to spam the hell out of other like I say '' get use to it , it be way better ! '' and while this could be consider with game that require keyboard and mouse use such as final fantasy\/etc when it come to game like first person shooter , you learn to grow a deep hate for the w , s , a , and d key . not to mention in the heat of the matter who want to reach halfway across they keyboard to tap r to reload , or hit u to talk , or n to switch weapon ?! I be a shooter by heart and game like Team Fortress 2 , leave 4 dead , Borderlands and call of duty it take much more than just skill master a keyboard . you break you finger on the pad and lose a lot of esteem work that way if you be not into it . it be why that when I have recieve this controller for say game I be in heaven . I have spend week attempt to master the game and even as I have grow use to they the fact have remain I be not a pc gamer . with the mad Catz xbox controller I feel like I have the control again and the edge . most of all I have a one up factor over even the console controller : a smoother compact feel , a more sensitive grip , and full access control map to give I the comfort on which button I feel better with . I will say I be deeply skeptical over get a controller for the pc just as much as play on it . for all I know I be get a piece of junk and that worried I . I be glad to say I have it all wrong and in the end I now have another new console to work with that will provide I another full year of entertainment . : -rrb- a few thing I should mention however about the controller that be not specify be that this be not a exact replica of the 360 's version . this be design to be more compact and the control to remain tighter as a group . the layout be design , in my opinion at the very least , more forward for quicker response and certain button be redesign larger for use of ease such as the left and right bumper . the biggest thing I should mention be the leave and right trigger which be make in a hook like mannor that when tap feel so much greater than the 360 version . the bonus side to all of this be that it do not just stop on the pc though . this controller can also work on you very console provide the same awesome control . a word of advice however to user who be play Team Fortress 2 : in order to gain the full function of you controller you must enter you option menu , go under the keyboard section , go into advanced option and click '' enable developer console '' upon return to the menu press the wave key '' ` '' and then enter on the command `` exec 360controller '' without the '' '' at which point you controller will auto tune to the original control feature on the 360 . for all other game the control easily adjust and can be tune . : -rrb-
Video_Games	POS	5	I have be a fan of the ea Sports NHL series since 1994 , when I buy nhl hockey 95 on cd-rom . due to my be a research nomad at the moment I do not play pc game anymore , but I do own a psp for which I buy nhl 07 the first day it come out in England . after have play several match , my first impression be \/ very \/ positive . the first thing you will notice be that the music be superb , go in the direction of rock , indie , and metal . secondly , you will be please by the in-game commentary by Jim Houston and Craig Simpson who add story about famous rivalry between the team currently play , or about the player who just shoot a goal . this really make the game as real as see hockey live on tv . in addition to the nhl team , there be now also the team from the Czech , finnish , german , and Swedish league -lrb- with licence for player name and team outfit -rrb- , as well as several national side -lrb- without licence -rrb- . this just add to the fascination . most importantly , the gameplay be excellent and just feel like real hockey . I be very impress by this game and glad I buy it . a great experience for any hockey fan !
Video_Games	POS	5	the multiplayer be really addictive . my first real foray into multiplayer . the single player feel like a on rail sort of game which kinda stink . I officially go full-on nerd and get a gaming headset for this game . it be so much fun . the update map be terrific . probably my favorite game thus far . ca not recommend this game enough . it be challenging but with some patient and weapon upgrade you 'll unlock the full potential for maximum fun . I love this game .
Video_Games	POS	5	I recently get this game for my 2 girl , age 5 and 3 , and it be one of they absolute favorite ! they love the `` strike up the band '' song at the beginning and have it memorize . they love choose outfit , groom the animal , and decorate the float . they ask to play this game all the time ! I highly recommend this game for any girl !
Video_Games	NEG	1	I buy a sharpshooter , a mini controller -lrb- whatever they be call -rrb- really only to play with this game . they do not work . at all . so , 2 star off for that . at least with kz3 you can fully customize how the move \/ sharpshooter work , with this -lrb- as far as what happen when you hit the iron sight button -rrb- you just can not . and it do not work . in short , do not even consider use this with a sharpshooter . I have really try to make it work , but no luck . once you hit the ironsight -lrb- zoom -rrb- button , forgehdaboudit . also , this be a completely different game than Res 1 and 2 . and , the problem be , that I really like resistance 1 and 2 . the two player split screen be horrible . it split you tv in half horizontally -lrb- the opposite of Res 1 -rrb- and it just come off feeling cramp . very uncomfortable . res1 work perfectly , no clue why they feel the need to change it . also -lrb- spoiler ? -rrb- : -rrb- let I ruin the game for you : every scene go like this . where be we suppose to go ? ahhh ! TOO MANY MONSTERS ! ! ! ! they be all dead ? ok . . where do I go next ? whereas Res 1 and 2 have you choose cover and take enemy out with headshot -lrb- my style -rrb- this be MONSTER MONSTER BUM RUSH BUM rush constantly . some people might call it `` intense '' . . I call it `` overwhelming-to-the-point-of-constant-frustration . '' -lrb- really ? I get hit by the 10 monster behind I because I be shoot the 20 monster in front of I ? yeah . . that be fair ! -rrb- : -rrb- my son and I be try to get through it , but tonight even he say . . `` wow , this game just be not very good , be it . . '' so , 1 star off for . . not match up to the joy that be 1 and 2 . finally , 1 more star off for this : the swearing . I know it be not for kid , neither be 1 or 2 . . but there be -lrb- comparably -rrb- very little swearing in 1 and 2 . plus , 1 and 2 be so good you could `` forgive '' it here and there . . this be not a very good game and it be back up by a annoying sound track of cuss word for no reason . Boo . so , here end another 1 star review . keep in mind I purchase many other product and game and be quite happy with they -lrb- and usually do not review they as there be enough positive review out there for you to read and help in you decision make . -rrb- I tend to only post review when I feel that the other side really need to be say in case you be try to make a purchase decision . in this case , I would highly recommend a rent or wait until you can get it use for 30 , especially if you be not into multiplayer like I . mho .
Video_Games	POS	5	Gamecube be very different from xbox and ps2 . the xbox and ps2 play dvd 's and cd 's but the gamecube be base only on the game and the fun in the game . thegamecube have great multyplayer game , in a way the gamecube graphic be not as good as ps2 and xbox but very fun . the system be very easy to get use to , the size of the system be like have a blow up sne but its very nice . the controller be a little hard to use but be sometimes very easy to get use to . the dark black color be enterest it make the gamecube look like a pieceof art . if you have a dvd player trust I you should get a gamecube its very fun to play with you friend and its get a lot of good game like super smash brother melee .
Video_Games	POS	4	touchy power switch it will flip with the slightest brush past the power button the rest of the unit be great and I be glad we buy it
Video_Games	POS	4	this game rock ! it be a little different from Super Mario Kart for SNES and Mario Kart 64 in that there be two character per kart , but there inly the fun ! twice the question block , more strategy -lrb- as far as when to release you item vs when to hold on to they -rrb- and add feature like have a second player controll one of the character -lrb- allow you back character to punch other kart -rrb- . New course be a lot of fun and cgus characte be a exciting challenge in the 150cc race .
Video_Games	NEG	1	this be the first and will be the last securom product I 'll ever buy . the game start off good enough , but eventually just become tedious and pointless . give it to the local thrift shop while there be still a activation or two leave . I 'll include a note that the drm stuff will soon make it worthless . Might be worth pay a buck for .
Video_Games	NEU	3	aside from the bug -lrb- which at the time i buy this game be many -rrb- it be a good game . think the expansion have make it more enjoyable . though i do prefer fallout 3 more .
