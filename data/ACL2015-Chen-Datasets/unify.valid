Sandal	POS	5	the keen sandal be simply the best I have ever have . they be very comfortable , fit you foot perfectly and the toe protection they offer be superior to any other I have ever try !
Sandal	NEU	3	after year of speculate , I purchase this 1st pair of Birks not know what to expect . the cradle you foot be in , be at first difficult to get use to with the ridge but soon become comfortable . they may be good for walk anywhere that do not have pebble , because once a pebble find it way onto the footbed , you have to take off the shoe to shake it out . otherwise the comfort level be definitely outstanding . I have be advise to not get they wet , that for I at least , be a new concept when wear sandal . at this price , they be definitely worth a try .
Sandal	POS	5	this be a gift purchase . always a great purchase with Rainbow . usually buy brown or tan . go for black . happy with purchase .
Sandal	POS	5	comfortable , hold up well , dry out after get wet and dont look dark like the leather one get after get wet , and they look good too .
Sandal	POS	5	have keen item before , easy to put on & take of . love the man 's shoe because of the wide foot . find it more room when item arrive do not have to break in . wear my first pair to the old country , have to take shoe of at security check point go through do not have to struckle . ship good , get item within 7 day . love to buy from Amazon .
Sandal	POS	5	this be my first birken actually , I use to think that they be too hard to wear and that I would hate they . well , give it 1 week so it fit perfectly you foot contour and I promise you will not take it off again . I spend my whole summer wear it all the time . it be very comfortable , it go with anything I be wear and it be very light in the foot . it be half a size larger actually , so keep that in mind when you order it ! all in all , I would buy it again !
Sandal	POS	5	I give these to my son last week for a birthday present . this be he second pr . the first pair last 7 summer . he like the removable strap and find they very comfortable . he be please with the fit -lrb- wear 10.5 and I get size 11 since they do not have he exact size . thank you Amazon for another great bargain !
Sandal	POS	4	all of these positive review lead I to believe that many of they be fake . that be say I like these sandal . they have have cover for you toe so you do not jam you they on anything , they have bumpy bottom for better grip , and they feel comfortable to walk in . the one thing that I do not like about these sandal be there be only one strap ! even when I tighten the strap all the way they feel loose if I do not wear a double pair of sock with they . I think I buy a size too big but the lack of extra strap for a tighter fit be a bad idea . I be return these but I may buy a smaller size in the future .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these for my husband for we Disney World vacation . they be great and comfortable for the whole week !
Sandal	POS	5	I be look for some sandal there be water proof . I have own a bunch of other leather Rainbow sandal but find they do not do well when they get even a little wet . these sandal hit the spot for just in time for my beach vacation . they be pretty comfortable but not as nice as the leather . I find they dry quickly and be not at all slippery on possibly slippery surface . I do not remember see on any of the tag if these have a lifetime warranty like the leather version .
Sandal	POS	5	pro : - solid , stable sandal with great foot support . - as always with keen shoe , the wide toe area make it very comfortable . - opening be wider than the classic Newport which make it airier for the summer . - Top be make of nylon in h2 vs leather in the classic . this make it quicker dry and lighter overall . - climb a jaggy volcanic hill in Saudi Arabia and Mukenya in Kenya , and the traction be amazing on these . con : - sand will mound up in the toe area since there be no hole for it to escape . - if you be hike trail with lot of loose debris they will get in the shoe and it be a bit of a nuisance to try and get they out without take it off . recommend you try the classic Newport and the h2 before you purchase . I find the classic 's footbed completely incompatible with my foot , but the h2 be perfect . the reverse may be true for you .
Sandal	POS	5	I have this one before and worn up . need a new and same one because it be perfect for my foot - comfortable ,
Sandal	POS	5	I be go on a camping trip that involve cave walking and learn at the last minute my sneaker would not be appropriate and be advise to buy a pair of Keens . I have -lrb- 48 hour before I leave on the trip and make this purchase with a one day delivery -- and it arrive on time . the shoe be perfect , comfortable and have not only walk in cave and up gentle sloping cliff , but in the backyard -lrb- very comfortable -rrb- and even in the ocean and beach in Hawaii . these be perfect shoe if you have to deal with moisture while walk . 5 Stars for sure .
Sandal	POS	5	I use to buy this 5 bottle at a time and have I know they be go to discontinue the scent , I would have buy as much of it as possible . it be the perfect type of sandalwood scent for this mix . impossible to come by lately . I wish they would start make this again !
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these with we Colorado trip this come May in mind and I have gotta say we get a great price ! and my husband have never once like a pair of sandal , but these in he word `` Feel amazing , so comfortable '' they look really nice on too : - -rrb- I be order a pair for myself right now !
Sandal	POS	5	these have become my go to shoe in summertime . this be my first parus of keen shoe and I bout a second pair base on how happy I be with these . you can ; t go wrong with these .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these shoe because I need something to get around in for a 2 week trip to Hawaii . I get they a couple day before we leave so I have no time to break they in , but they feel break in the first day i wear they . I wear they hike and on the beach and on volcanic rock . I have never be wild about sandal , but I can tell you I be anxious for spring in Colorado so I can wear they again . I be a photographer , and I pretty much expect to wear these pretty much all the time during summer landscape shoot ! I highly recommend they !
Sandal	POS	5	these be so cool I be so glad i can wear these and be cool like a surfer even though i live in the central valley
Sandal	POS	5	buy they close to 3 year ago and they be still go strong , even with daily beach use for a solid year and a half .
Sandal	POS	5	I be on about my fourth pair of these . they be almost the only shoe I wear on the boat in the summertime . the sipe sole afford traction on a wet deck . I find the best price on Amazon , so I order two pair ... one for home and one for the boat .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these shoe for a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon . I go from the river to hike rocky path , sandy path , down creek bed and back and not one blister , and they provide great support on the rock as well . I be go to buy another pair . love 'em !
Sandal	NEG	1	great concept , but poor quality . tear apart at the seem after one use ; a moderate 8 mile hike in the wood . these would be such a better product have they have better craftsmanship . definitely not worth $ 100 if you plan on do any actual hike with they .
Sandal	POS	4	I buy this because I like the product . I have have it before and about every 2 year I need a new pair since I wear they out . this product rock just like the one I have 2 year before that , and the one I have 2 year before that . I be a fan .
Sandal	POS	4	I get my exercise by walk in chest deep water . the surface I walk on be smooth -lrb- too smooth , occasionally -rrb- but these shoe keep I move well . they fit well and be very comfortable . I be have some difficulty become accustomed to the rubbing of my toe on the interior of the shoe but I will , no doubt , become inure . I be pleased with they . mike hogan
Sandal	NEU	3	these seem like nice sandal , and I think they would be comfortable if they fit . I order my normal shoe size , but they be much too small to wear . I recommend order a bigger size .
Sandal	POS	5	they be every thing that I expect . they look good and be comfortable and I expect they to last a very long time .
Sandal	POS	5	these sandal have be a must for my wardrobe since I buy my first pair about 5 year ago . they be comfortable and versatile , stylish and appropriate with jeans or a suit . I have receive many compliment about they , and have they in black and brown . I be glad they be available on Amazon .
Sandal	POS	5	these be super comfortable birk . Perfect for dress occasion or go to the beach . comfortable feel on top with solid corks\/leather-like material on sole .
Sandal	POS	5	I have a pair of keen sandal several year ago and really like they but the soleskept come unglued . this pair have a different sole and that will never be a problem . I have orthotic in some of my other shoe but these feel like they have good arch support right from the start . I be very satisfied with they !
Sandal	POS	4	there be plenty of review here explain how awesome these Keen 's be . I agree . these be the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn . wear they exclusively for a very active week-long trip to Kauai and they be perfect . keep my foot cool and comfortable and provide great support for hike and walk . I only have two criticism : they get smelly very quickly and the sole be not as grippy as expect . walk for a day or two in these and they will develop pretty strong foot odor . scrub they with soap and water get rid of it , but it return pretty quickly . also , I expect the black rubber tread to have good grip on rock and such . they be okay , but tend to slide more than expect . perhaps the sole be make to be more durable and be a little too hard to get good traction . they be great for dirt trail or on concrete or asphalt . I do not trust they on wet rock or slick surface .
Sandal	POS	5	Ok , I be not the `` review stuff online '' kind of person ; this be the first time I have do so . but as I put my four year-old pair of Keen Newport h2 sandal on this morning , I be totally appreciate they comfort and longevity ! I can honestly say that when these wear out -lrb- whenever that may be ! -rrb- , I will go out and buy another pair . they be just well-built , comfortable , and attractive as these kind of sandal could be . my foot have be so happy !
Sandal	POS	4	I receive these for part of a costume . the geta be very good quality , but note that they be not the traditional style : these have more the profile of a pair of high-heel than the more traditional double-t shape such as worn by character like Urahara Kisuke in Bleach . more likely , these could be worn in a costume in place of flat , black sandal . the strap feel a bit tight around the toe and strangely weak , though they feel like they will last through a weekend-long convention with no problem . that say , I receive these before they be re-list with the `` colorful strap , '' so you will not get the same sort of strap . the wood be surprisingly light but durable . I have accidentally clank the two together with no damage to either . these do have light sole , as well , so you geta will not be make direct contact with the floor . the pair I receive be almost precisely a men ' size 7 shoe . thankfully , my foot happen to be just smaller than that . they may take a little get use to , as I still can not wear they for more than a few hour at a time . these be definitely worth a shot if you have a way of make it work into either you wardrobe or you costume .
Sandal	NEG	2	very comfortable , foot love the massage from the nub . Quality have go south . the massage nub break off at a unreasonable rate . be prepare to buy replacement often once you get addict to these .
Sandal	POS	5	I purchase these for my 13 year old . they be instantly comfortable , and he wear they everywhere .
Sandal	NEG	2	I love my keen sandal , mostly due to nice fit , they be a little sweatty though . so much that I buy the shoe -lrb- very good -rrb- , buy the work boot -lrb- steel toe also very good -rrb- , buy the sock -lrb- not so good -rrb- . I do not honestly wear the h2 sandal that much , maybe have they about a year -lrb- buy they last late summer\/fall -rrb- , but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe , 4 -5 month a year or so . so we go to Grand Tetons , these be my `` off hike day '' shoe for the trip . we do a 6 mile flat hike and the back rip out of one of they . by the way the sock have hole in the side -lrb- not heal or toe like you might expect -rrb- . use to be all they product seem to have 5 star rating ... I think the expansion to all kind of shoe may be cause some kind of performance issue . so not much use , the tread on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heel rip . I dunno if I will get another keen shoe , I be see some of they newer stuff have some bad rating . still I would take they over almost anything Teva , but not at full price . I guess I would take another shot for $ 50 or $ 60 ... but for $ 100 they need to last more than a season .
Sandal	POS	5	I have use this sandal for hike , walk dry or in the rain , run , and bicycling , it handle everything ! never get a blister , and they feel so comfortable , even better than my Nike Airs , its amazing . I wear these the whole day my foot never experience any irritation , they be just great ! keen # 1 !
Sandal	POS	4	a lot of people say it feel a half size too small but I think it feel true to both size and width . I receive these shoe and be please to find that there be not any break-in time . I have a job where I walk around for 8 hour straight ; I wear these the first day without any pain later that evening or the next day . there be a adjustable elastic cord that can be tighten , but I think the shoe be more comfortable if they be leave a little loose . I have they tighten one day and notice a pinch sensation after a couple hour of use . another reason to wear they loose be that it make it easier to put they back on if you foot be wet or sweaty they feel like they have very good traction but I be not walk through river with slippery rock so it be not the best test . because these be closed-toe sandal , it create a problem when small rock , sand , or other object get into the shoe . I find that I can not just wiggle my foot around to get rid of the nuisance , I need to take the shoe completely off and dump it out . another thing I notice about these shoe be that it dry out the back of my heel . I only have to apply lotion once to correct the dryness and I have not have a problem since , but it be something to be aware of . overall this be a great sandal and I do not have to worry about stick or other object stab my toe because of the closed-toe feature . I have own these for about a month now and they do not show any sign of wear so I expect they to hold up for a long time . I would not recommend they for walk around on the beach because sand and rock get trap underneath you foot and up in the toe area , but for walk through river and as a casual shoe these be great . one last problem that I just think of be that they be not comfortable for stand around with minimal movement for long period of time . it be possibly just my foot , but anyone interested in these should try they on and stand around for a while to see how they feel .
Sandal	POS	5	this be the first pair of Keens my husband have have and he be pretty please with they - so comfortable and hopefully no more smelly foot !!! highly recommend they .
Sandal	POS	5	I be in my late 50 's and have not worn sandal since I be a kid . however , my son-in-law have a pair of these and recently let I try they on while visit . I be instantly hooked and order mine right away in time for a Florida beach vacation . they be send from the vendor in less time than promise and I have be wear they constantly since then . they be comfortable and well-made as Sperry boat shoe . -lrb- I have be through several pair of those over the last 35 year and love they . -rrb- they do not slip off you foot while walk and do not irritate between the toe . I recommend these even if you do not usually wear sandal , but be look for some casual attire for the hot weather .
Sandal	POS	5	Love Keens ! they be comfortable , easy to maintain , and look exactly the same after lot of wear . they be machine washable and tolerate all sort of abuse . would definitely recommend . these be purchase for my husband . they be he second pair and be pretty much the only thing he wear on he foot all summer .
Sandal	POS	5	I have purchase a total of five pair of this sandal over the year , and I have two still new in the box . I live in annual fear that Sperry will discontinue they . the cushy , just-right footb as well as the overall comfort and durability make these sandal a great value . they can be worn every wake minute even while walk great distance in total comfort . I always order my actual shoe size and get a perfect fit . Hooray for Sperry in keep old fashion , make to last value in a product that be a great performer .
Sandal	POS	4	these be great shoe as they offer firm support versus flip flop - yet just as cool -lrb- temperature wise -rrb- . these be my go-to outdoor shoe for summer , except for when I be run . I have even be tempt to wear these on a short run - but have not . the Keens be worth the price . shipping and order delivery from the seller go like clockwork .
Sandal	POS	5	my husband use to have a pair of birkenstock several year ago , and he always want to own another pair of Birkenstock . so I do some research before order from Amazon , one of my favorite online retailer . the shipping be fast with a nicely package . my husband be very happy with he gift . I be very pleased and happy with my purchase .
Sandal	NEU	3	i have a pair of these exact shoe that i wear for about 5 year before they wear out . i buy this pair last summer and they be just as wear out as the one i have for 5 year . the rubber and foam be both make of less durable product now . not nearly as supportive as they use to be . still comfortable when new , but it do not last long .
Sandal	POS	5	I receive my Birkenstocks in a timely manner ! they be comfortable the moment I put they on . I wear they almost everyday . the color be neutral , so it match nicely with a lot of outfit .
Sandal	POS	5	the very best walk shoe I have ever purchase . very resilient and resistnat to scuff and tear , unlike meny other I have try .
Sandal	POS	5	I have three pair of this sandal . my first pair -lrb- now my bicycling shoe -rrb- be purchase just prior to a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon . work well for the hiking in the canyon , walk in the river , and rafting in the Colorado . work great for everyday wear in Florida . the only shoe I wear now though my wife make I keep a pair of Allen Edmunds for funerals\/weddings . -lrb- I will be bury in my keen . -rrb- they be comfortable , great look -lrb- only sandal I ever own that people have ask where I get they -rrb- . great arch support .
Sandal	POS	5	the Sperry sandal be a well make product and have a sole that be very good on wet and slippery deck . I would difinately recommend this product .
Sandal	NEU	3	size run a little small but over all a decent sandal . this be my second pair and like original one better .
Sandal	POS	4	I buy these as a replacement pair for the old leather reef flip flop that I love but they no longer make . as state in other review , expect a serious break in period . these sandal be very tight at first and actually rub the top of my foot raw the first time I wear they for a extend period of walk . however , the strap stretch out and the foot bed compress down so they loosen up and really do become very comfortable . if you can deal with a couple uncomfortable day at first in exchange for -lrb- hopefully -rrb- a few year of solid comfort , go ahead and pick a pair up .
Sandal	POS	5	he wear out he first pair -lrb- but it take a couple of year of hard wear on the boat and dock -rrb- . he even duct tape they together until I could get he replacement - would not wear different sandal . this time I buy a spare pair !
Sandal	NEU	3	wow , just like the coral you hear so much about , the reef shoe be shrink . since 1996 this style have shrink about 2 size , and get narrower . I have a 13 foot and wear size 12 reef back in the 90 's when thing be generous . but then after after 911 they seem a bit smaller so I go for the size 13 which be just a little bigger . just now I buy the 13 and they be 1\/2 inch narrower and shorter than the previous 13 's so it look like I will need a size 14 . WTF ?!? its not some supermarket consumable item that get smaller and smaller be it ? I mean its a shoe ? I mean the size be the same right ? Whats next ? a 42 inch tv that be actually 39 inch ? what about hat , be they shrink ? Whats go on when the shoe size shrink a entire inch in 15 year ? `` ok we need to increase profit , let make the shoe smaller '' its still a good well build flip flop , but they be make in china now , be that the answer ?
Sandal	NEG	1	the last pair of keen sandal I buy , for my wife and I , be thoroughly appreciate as to durabilty and comfort , but say to say , the one we order this time be inferior in every respect . the size be mark the same , unfortunately they appear to be mean for child . the material be overly lightweight and strange , definetly unlike the one we have buy originally , which be make in the USA . Yours truly , Dennis Mora
Sandal	POS	5	hand down the most comfortable sandal out of the box I have ever worn . they go well with anything and be comfortable and easy to walk in as well as easy to clean . just a great sandal all around .
Sandal	POS	5	I have have Birks for 20 yr and these be the first that I have have that have the soft in-sole . I love 'em , superkawika
Sandal	POS	5	these shoe be no longer available in store . when I recently go on the timberland website , I find out that they no longer make this shoe . the only one available appear to be whatever be leave in the Amazon.com seller ' stock . I buy a pair of these about 5 year ago at Dillards , and they be the most comfortable shoe I have ever own until I finally wear they out . I just get a new pair and use mink oil to soften they up . it work great .
Sandal	POS	5	the Clark 's man 's Hudson Sandal I purchase be the most comfortable and versitile footwear I have own in a long time . my wife swear by Clark 's and now I do too . they can be wear with or without the backstrap , which be removable , the footbed be leather and the sole absorb you stride . I do not know they make man 's product until I do a search on Amazon.com . my highest praise .
Sandal	POS	4	very comfortable . arrive quicker than I expect . price be right . you can not ask for anything more than that unless they be free .
Sandal	POS	5	great shoe , but if you be look at these you already know that . I buy a off color because they be the cheapest here on Amazon , but they be the best color anyway . go figure . so shop around here , amazing the small difference in price . I have a wide foot and they fit I fine , seem to be true in size .
Sandal	POS	5	I highly recommend this product . it look good and feel good . a extremely comfortable sandal . I normally do not bother do review , however this product be really worth it .
Sandal	POS	5	my foot love they right out of the box ! you can take off the heel strap and use they for `` slip on '' but for `` off road '' use the heel strap .
Sandal	POS	4	love the sandal except for one thing : I find the toe strap -lrb- make of leather -rrb- to be relatively wide and stiff , therefore somewhat uncomfortable . it be possible the strap will soften and\/or my toe will toughen up as they break in . -lrb- my foot be pretty sensitive . -rrb- they be quite comfortable otherwise though , and very well make .
Sandal	POS	5	I have a pair of they and wear they out finally they start make they again . they be the same in look and comfort
Sandal	POS	5	Have have these shoe for several week now , great boat shoe , beefy enough you can put you foot down on that big snapper that be flip around in the back of the boat and feel that you foot will be protect . no scuff mark in the boat . Great for wade fishing , I walk out into the grass bed here in the intercoastal of the Florida panhandle and these shoe be work great . Easy on and off , dry pretty fast . I have a pair of speedo water shoe before these , they stink . the eyelet in the speedo have all rust and be pull through , spend the money and get a better pair with these keen .
Sandal	POS	4	I love birkenstock sandal . let 's just say that right off the bat . I love these shoe . they feel so good on my foot . when I can find these shoe on sale , I buy they . if I can not , I buy Betula Sandals ... very similar ... same feel . well , I see these advertise as my favorite shoe with a soft footbed , which I have never have before . so , I buy they . sorry , footbed feel the same to I . that be my only complaint . it be not worth the extra $ 20.00 . other than that ... a great shoe .
Sandal	NEG	1	the high and very hard arch be not right for I . I would not recommend unless you can try it on in a store to see if it be right for you .
Sandal	POS	5	very comfortable and durable especially on the inside of the shoe . these be replace a identical pair worn frequently for 6 year .
Sandal	POS	5	great sandal ! I have have mine for 4 year , and they be comfortable , durable and reasonably price . I have put mine through quite a bit of wear . Beach camping , camp shoe for backpacking , every day wear as a student , etc. . they handle all of it . as far as the smell go , in my experience the leather version smell worse than the hemp , but like any footwear where sock be not worn , there can be some odor .
Sandal	POS	5	this the one of the few fragrance that I truly love and it layer well with my favorite perfume . from what I have be tell the reason why Body & Bath do not have this fragrance in stock at time be because Sandalwood have become so rare and it be hard for they to get the fragrance at a reasonable price .
Sandal	POS	4	I love these sandal . - they be very rugged . - the snug , secure fit over the foot and around the ankle pair with the unique toe space -lrb- see caveat below -rrb- match my preferred fit for a shoe . - the foot bed have just that right amount of cushion and comfort while still feel solid and stable . they really hit the `` magic '' mix on this . - the bolster around the heel and arch eliminate side to side movement create a very stable feel about these shoe . - the hybrid nature of these shoe cause I to reach for they far more often than my sandal or hiking\/walking shoe . have you ever try to run in sandal ? how long do it take to dry hike shoe after a wade ? now to my small caveat : 1 . it may be just that I have a abnormally tall big-toe , but I could stand just one more millimeter of space in the toe well over the top . in fact , the first time I buy a pair of these , I have to return they after a couple day because my toenail just-barely touch the top of the toe well and make I nut . eventually I find a pair that have just that tiny bit of extra space and I snatch they up . this bring I to my second caveat . 2 . you would not expect it , but the size variation across style and even within the same style be pretty significant . I be sure I would never be able to own a pair of keen because of the toe fit thing . when I find they on sale recently , I decide to have another try . to my surprise , I find a pair of original Newport in 10.5 -lrb- my size -rrb- that fit awesome with no toe problem ... but they be leather , which I do not want , and they be just the most ridiculous light green color . next I try the h2 with nylon strap . the first 10.5 be way too small , for fun I try two other 10.5 s , all of which feel like they be different size . then I try a 11 . these be too big by a long-shot . I be ready to leave when I try a 11.5 on a whim and they fit perfectly ... I think you need to try these shoe on before you buy . I buy everything I can online , but in the case of keen shoe , I would be really hesitant .
Sandal	POS	5	the double layer sandal definitely have more support than the single layer . better choice and definitely worth the extra few buck . the `` break in '' time be about a week . it be not too bad the `` break in '' time as some of the other reviewer have say but after it mold to you foot , they be very comfortable and will only get better with time and usage . the strap be tight in the beginning . the size do run a bit small . I wear a size 9 man medium and order a medium -lrb- 8.5 - 9.5 -rrb- and it fit the length of my foot barely , but if I order the next size up , in the long run , it will look a bit too big . like other say , if in doubt , order the next size up . the sandal be narrow and will be tight the first few time you wear they but will be worth it . Mine be so comfortable and I have be wear they every time I step out the door . I walk my dog in they , run errand in time , go everywhere with they . I buy color gray and sierra brown . if you like the sierra brown color , I would suggest order the dark brown color because with wear and tear and footprint , the dark brown will not be as noticeable when it get dirty as the sierra brown .
Sandal	POS	5	I love these flip flop . they take a little while to break in but they be so nice . they have a good amount of arch support which be rare for flip flop , they also be very durable and be mean to last . I believe the company will even replace the top layer if it ever get damage -lrb- the Rainbow company not the store that be sell these flip flop -rrb- , definitely worth the money .
Sandal	POS	5	keen sandal shoe be great for everything . I already have a pair so we order these for my husband . he love they too . they be not you ordinary man 's sandal . they let you foot breath and the sole be make from non absorbent material which be sweat proof . they be good for hike and water activity as well as everyday wear . great product all around !
Sandal	POS	5	this be my first birky and I love they . highly recommend they for we sandalfoot . well craft and comfortable as all hell . would definitely puchase again .
Sandal	POS	5	this be avery comfortable shoe that you can wear all day . I would recommend this shoe over the loose slip-on and off sandal or flip-flop . you will have as much support as you can get from a close in shoe . I love mine !
Sandal	NEG	1	I buy a pair of these exact same shoe -lrb- size 10 -rrb- 2 year ago . they last two whole year and be still very wearable . I have just wear the tread off . I order a new pair with great confidence , and wait for delivery . that be where the pro end . the pair I receive in the mail be MUCH MUCH smaller , and two different size ! the left one do fit , very tightly , but I figure it be because they be new . the right one do not fit at all . I compare they to each other and the two shoe be different size . they be both marked US size 10 . I then compare they to the old one that be considerably larger and also marked US size 10 . my old one be also mark as make in the U.S.A. and the new one be from china . I call a friend that have also recently buy a pair of keen shoe from REI.com . they be two small for he as well , and he say one be smaller than the other ... keen , what have happen ? you go from AWESOME to lame in two year ? I will not be buy anymore keen product anytime soon . I have return these shoe to amazon , and can not review these as positive in any way .
Sandal	POS	5	we order these shoe , they be what my husband want . we receive they before time promise . completely satisfy .
Sandal	POS	5	this be my second pair of these sandle . they be smart look , extremely comfortable , and durable . wear barefoot with shorts or wear with sock for jeans or slacks . thank you , Timberland !
Sandal	POS	4	I purchase these for my husband . he have a pair like they year ago and want another pair . he say the adissage piece be hurt he foot more than massage they so we scrape those off of the shoe and he wear they all of the time now .
Sandal	POS	4	I order the woman 's Keen Newport h2 in the aqua haze\/brittany blue color . the actual color I receive be closer to the process Blue . these be Way brighter . I be expect a more muted blue . aside from the misrepresentation of color , -lrb- maybe it be my computer screen -rrb- the sandal be great ! I normally wear a size 8m , they fit perfectly , but I be a short , wider 8m , so those of slender foot be warn . you can however adjust the fit a little with the elastic tie . they be also very comfortable . not disappointing .
Sandal	POS	5	I receive these shoe very quickly and be really pleased with this product ... only one word of warn when order any birkenstock make sure you order the correct width as most of the range come in a wide width and slim width . I have a very narrow foot and these arrive as a slim fit and fit perfectly . would purchase from this vendor again pain free and no hassle ... thank you
Sandal	POS	5	my husband say : wear they daily . nice arch support , my heel fall in the center rather than on the left side , all in all the best flip flop I have ever have on my foot and I have try they all , Tevas , Rainbows , you name it .
Sandal	POS	4	product arrive on time as promise . color be good . it will require a lot of break in since it seem stiffer than other sandal plus the toe splitter seem to pinch some .
Sandal	POS	5	excellent sandal that can be worn anywhere . plus that , it last forever ! this be my second pair and i rate it top shelf .
Sandal	POS	4	at first I think spend this much money for a pair of sandle be normally not I . I would rather go to Walmart and get a pair of $ 25 special to last I a few month but the pickings be limit here on Guam -lrb- and no Walmart . a Kmart but no Walmart -rrb- I think I give `` online '' shop a try . I find these keen on Amazon and base my choice due to the color to be honest ... man 's blue yellow fade represent the Navy Colors . so I take a gamble and spend so-so money for these shoe and since they arrive I have wear they everyday . they that comfortable . the next time I need sandle I be go keen again . sorry Walmart .
Sandal	POS	5	absolutely awesome h2o sandal ! I buy my Keen Newport H2o 's in 2005 to go on a trip to Costa Rica for 14 day . I be in sand , rock , mud , muck , lava rock , the ocean , river , everything in between , and they perform flawlessly . Easy to Clean , Lightweight , durable , great support , Great Protection , H2o Friendly . I still wear they every spring and summer and they be hold up very well . there be absolutely no separation that I can see anywhere on they , other than `` 1 string '' that go around the side patch where the keen logo be located . and as far as the toe guard go ... it be extremely Tuff . if you smack you toe against a rock , it just bounce right back . you might feel a vibration of course , but I honestly never hurt any toe in these shoe ... -lrb- knock on wood -rrb- . I would not be surprise if these last another 3 to 5 yr , but by then I will have buy a nice new pair of Keens : -rrb- highly recommend !!
Sandal	POS	5	I have worn these sandal extensively and they be very comfortable and appear to be very well construct . the first thing I notice after purchase they be the weight , they be a bit heavier than you average sandal but still very easy to wear . keep in mind the sandal be white and dirt will show up easily if you be not careful . overall a great product .
Sandal	POS	5	there be allot of different vendor for birkenstock on Amazon and , in my opinion , ya get to be careful that you be get real leather instead of the Birkobuc fake leather . I have leather birk that be over ten year old and still go strong . these be real , black leather birk and I pay $ 77.00 for they . fast free shipping and a trouble free transaction . highly recommend Amazon and Birkenstock .
Sandal	NEU	3	the fit be a little tight . but the length of the sole fit my foot so I hope the ankle strap stretch over time . the size run small so get a half size down . I be usually a 10 but the newport i have before and these h2 be 9.5 . see customer pic of my 7 year old leather newport on Amazon . happy with the color but the material seem way cheaper and thinner than I have expect . not supprise since every other chinese product I buy keep get cheaper or crappier . and what happen in most company 's quality control dept ?!? do they even exist anymore ?
Sandal	POS	5	this my second pair of Birkenstock sandal in the last 6 month . these sandal be so comfortable that I buy another pair so I would have a spare pair .

Sandal	POS	5	these sandal like other rainbow sandal be amazing . I have have my original pair for several year . it take a little bit of time but after a little bit of time they conform to you foot .
Sandal	POS	4	while the footbed be well shaped and give good support to the arch , I be disappoint that there be not more `` give '' in the sole . it remind I of the wooden Dr. scholl sandal I use to wear in college . now , all these year later , I have a achy knee ligament , and these sandal do not do much to absorb the shock of a footfall , especially on concrete or asphalt . my foot love they , but my knee do not .
Sandal	POS	5	this be my second pair of ` bo . no sandal in the world like 'em . you will never know till you wear they . supplier be quick to deliver and as state in the listing .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy one pair and they be so comfortable and good look that I immediately purchase a second pair which I get today . do not know how well they will wear but I have never have a problem with timberland
Sandal	POS	5	big fan of the flop . give they a little wear and they form to you foot perfectly . very glad about this purchase .
Sandal	POS	5	light weight , durable , great toe protection and quick on\/off . never own a pair of Keens , Teevas or any type of sandal like this so I can not compare it to other but this particular one be a recommend . I usually wear 9.5 and the 9 fit perfect with a little room .
Sandal	POS	4	i be worry about the way the sandal look in the picture since they round up , but ddint effect walk or anything . very comfortable my boyfriend say . he like they a lot !
Sandal	NEG	1	give this as a gift think it would be a sturdy and well make alternative to the cheapo flip-flop . manage to tear up my boyfriend foot - try to break they in all summer to no avail . they be just really not flexible and whatever they be make of rub on skin the wrong way . a waste of money .
Sandal	POS	4	great product . they fit well and very comfortable . I will be buy addition pair to make sure I have they in the future
Sandal	POS	5	these flop be a little more money BUT worth be , my other half go thru 2\/3 cheap pair a season or they break apart , he be on the 2nd summer and still go strong ! when these wear out he will be get a third pair . I get 2 last year because I never think they would hold up I be wrong ! he say they be comfy and still feel good on he foot !!! thanks Rainbow !!! you will be he flop of choice from now on !!!
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I use to be a subscriber and a avid reader . recently , perhaps in the last two year or so , the quality of the writing have become rather poor . the selection of article be uninteresting , and sometimes half the article themselves be so poorly write as to be unreadable . the fiction be simply mediocre , and the entire magazine seem to be infect with editor Lewis Lapham 's shrill and ever-growing notebook -lrb- do the man ever have anything interesting or original to say ? -rrb- . in short , Harper 's be not the magazine it once be . I would suggest the Atlantic monthly if you want a magazine that be interesting , informative , and well-written , cover to cover .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	... then you will love Vogue ! vogue be the fashion magazine -- the competition pale in comparison . this gem do not only supply beauty and fashion advice , it breathe it . I love the article on the latest fashion , love the profile on the latest designer and I absolutely love the layout take from runway show in London , Paris , Milan , New York , etc. . I shall continue to renew my subscription as long as Vogue continue to maintain my healthy diet of Valentino and Prada .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	Asimov 's science fiction magazine be one of the premier source of new short story and novellum length science fiction . it also have the occasional serialized novel . have be introduce to science fiction through Isaac Asimov 's own short story anthology back in the 70 's I be surprise to find how much I enjoy the return to the short story format after many year of `` blockbuster novel '' . the magazine consistently showcase the best new talent . it also have a stable of veteran , commercially successful , writer that use the magazine as a vehicle to return to they root . notable such as Michael Swanwick , James Patrick Kelly , Kage Baker , and Tom Purdom to name a few . Asimov 's seem to always have nominee in the yearly Nebula and Hugo award for science fiction .  most story be `` Social Science fiction '' in which a loose future backdrop be use to tell a character base story with a eventual universal truism reveal . it be rare to find a `` hard science fiction '' story in which the extrapolation of known science into a future setting play a critical role in the climax and conclusion of the story . Stories from the early writings of Larry Niven be good example of such story . this be a forgivable lapse as most editor would tell you that they would love to see more hard science submission .  the magazine also boast one of the best editorial section pen by acclaimed author Robert Silverberg . he cover topic range from strict science to historical recollection of the science fiction genre . he have also reintroduce many reader to lose story and author such as Cordwainer Smith with great biographical piece .  they also have poem ; no offense Mr. Haldeman .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I have be subscribe to Nat Geo Magazine for year now and truly look forward to each and every issue I receive . it be high quality in every way - from the writing of the article , to the outstanding photograph , to the paper it be print on . it be rare that I skip any article in the magazine - I read they from cover to cover . I wish there be more magazine with the reputation and amazing quality that National Geographic produce each month .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	I read this cover to cover for the inside scoop ... but I miss Guilding Light : o -lrb-
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	for I , the September issue of Vogue , with its 700 page issue , be more than eye candy . it be art . it be that simple . I no longer look at most of the fashion in the magazine , nor the model , as realistic , something that can ever transfer into my own life , nor would I want it to . it remind I of trip to art museum where I can admire one painting half the afternoon , but it do not mean I want it hang on my wall at home . Vogue 's photography be exquiste , pure art . the glossy page , the vibrant , sometimes muted color , seem to jump off the page . the image make my mind wander and explore . when I finally get over the ridiculous price and the more ridiculously thin model with leg longer than I be tall , I be able to fully appreciate the artistry of the ad and fashion spread . I find the ad be as engaging as the fashion spread , which be a good thing , for the magazine be at least half ad . some of the article be quite good as well . I scan the few society article , and I have be surprise at the high number of well-written piece that apply to the average world-wise woman . Cosmo reader most likely will not find much in Vogue , but I would say woman over 30 , who be relatively sophisticated , will find article gear toward they . overall , Vogue be a high end publication with excellent , artistic photographer and produce rather sweet eye candy with a good number of current , well-written non-fashion article .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	this be a great magazine to come up with interesting idea to implement in you house . most of the item advertise be a bit expensive , but for the most part it be a great read .

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	some anonymous person leave three issue of this magazine in the chiropractor 's office , where my wife start read and then ask if she could have they . sure , say the receptionist . thus be we introduce to a very inspirational magazine . who know ? maybe it be angel-guided . we like this magazine enough to subscribe -- which be what bring I here to do this review . `` angel on Earth '' be publish six time a year by guidepost , which many people know through the `` guidepost '' magazine -lrb- inspirational -rrb- and holiday theme book . although guidepost be definitely a christian publisher , the `` Angels '' magazine itself be non-denominational and even inter-religious at time . one of the three issue we find in the doctor 's office have a story about a jewish Holocaust survivor . another story be about a child look for a lose cat , with no real focus on God as such , other than be `` guide '' to look in a unlikely place . some of the people in the story be not all that religious or , if they be , they particular religion be present as a part of they personal bio as it fit into the story , not as preaching or `` witness . ''  the illustration , too vary widely -- from `` church Sunday school '' picture of angel from the Renaissance master , to more ordiinary drawing of sea captain , cop , lumberjack , ordinary mom and dad -- depend on the story they illustrate . -lrb- if you know `` guidepost '' , you know the artwork -- otherwise , think `` Reader 's Digest . '' -rrb-  the purpose of the magazine be not to convert you to anything but , rather , to tell true story about people who have have encounter with guardian angel . `` belief '' be leave up to the reader . some of the angel story be of the `` miracle '' type : survive car crash , shipwreck , serious illness , etc. . other be of the more `` ordinary '' type , such as the stranger who be there at the right moment . this fit with the jewish pov of a angel , since the Hebrew word , malach , can refer either to a supernatural be or a earthly messenger .  personally , I believe in angel , and I find the story fascinating . grant , some of they might strike you as version of `` the vanishing hitchhiker . '' on the other hand , all the story be first-person , by-lined account , often with photo of the people or animal involve . and how do we know the vanishing hitchhiker be not a real angel sometimes ?

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	I subscribe to Kiplinger 's Retirement Report several year ago , but decide to give it a try again . the magazine , if that be what you call a 20 page publication with 4 page devote to one page ad , be write for individual who be in or near `` the end of life '' stage . the article deal with conserve the money you have , provide interest rate that be not even close to the highest insured rate available . they never give idea for travel or thing to do outside of you home or with grandchild . the best and only section I ever get any thing from be the question ask by reader section and that be keep to one page . I guess the Editors feel there be no point in expand the one good section this brochure do have . I would recommend you save you money and not subscribe to this publication . I suggest , instead , you subscribe to a real magazine with information you can use every month Kiplinger 's Personal Finance a much superior publication for half the price .

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEU	3	like so many magazine that have decide to pursue the relatively affluent core of they subscription , Chicago magazine be great if you want to read a magazine to figure out what to buy . it be get lot of article that be relevant to you if you be upwardly mobile , either live in the suburb or have a car to get there , and be interested in the latest trend in entertainment and shopping . that say , it be just not what I look for in a magazine . I have read many issue and while the writing be pretty good , I have never find a article that I think be worth saving , or even much that tell I something I do not know about Chicago , and I have only live here a few year . do not be fool by the title -- this magazine be fine for what it be , but it do not even come close to cover Chicago .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	j-14 be cheap and not well write . in my opinion , it focus too much on celebrity and not enough on thing teens age 11-15 really care about -lrb- intellectual one at least -rrb- . unless you really want to know what Britney Spears eat for breakfast every Thursday , skip it and go for seventeen or Girls Life .

I once subscribe several year ago and , although it be a look at the picture and toss after skim type of magazine , think enough of the magazine to give it another try , but take my advice and save you money . you 'll just get excuse and aggravation , lose money and receive nothing but a chance to write a review and complain .

Unafraid to poignantly uncover some of the world 's most touchy subject , this magazine also proudly display some of the most talented writer and essayist in the world . with former contributor include V.S. Naipul , Joyce Carol Oates , Don Dilillo , et al. , you would be hard press to find a literary rival . fun , user friendly , challenging , and eye opening , Harper 's be just the best thing out there . hold a firm edge over such other as Atlantic monthly , the New Yorker , Mother Jones , and the Economist , Harper 's deliver information and creativity with zeal unmatched in today 's magazine scene .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	its quite simple National Geographic be the magazine . no other publication can deliver the article , the photo , the research proyect , the map and the overal quality . this a magazine for those with the constant `` itch '' to go further and to learn more about the world and the universe .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I be a NatGeo junky . my collection of this magazine span four decade . this publication be magnificent for many of the reason that have already be state . if human be to send a capsule into deep space so that a alien culture might come upon it and learn something about the Earth and it be inhabitant , many have suggest that the capsule contain the entire National Geographic collection - 1888 to the present . in what other publication can you find fascinating article , map , rendering and photo on Pterodons , a frog epidemic , Lewis & Clark , the Hubble space telescope , and balinese culture - and all this in a single issue ?! it truly be the Universal Encyclopedia . answer accusation : the magazine report on `` the world and everything in it '' as honestly and evenly as any publication could hope to do . in the past decade , many of Geographic 's story have focus on imperil species , culture or ecosystem . these be hugely important issue that we should be proud to learn about . I get incense when people accuse the magazine and its editor of be political -lrb- leftist -rrb- . every article -lrb- I have read every issue since 1961 -rrb- which concern the environment explore both side of the issue at hand - the need of people and the impact on the planet . the Magazine have not become more liberal in the past 4 decade , the world itself have become a more impoverished place as the we number have soar past 6 billion . this magazine get my absolute highest recommendation . I wish that everyone out there would subscribe to and collect National Geographic . not only will they become a ornament on you bookshelf or coffee table , but you 'll be wiser and more worldly after immerse yourself in they , as well .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I would like to classify myself as a moderate but I probably lean conservative . because of that , I subscribe to Harpers so that I could read good writing that would challenge my belief and stretch my mind in new way . I get that , more or less , at first , but over the course of a couple of year the magazine drift further and further to a leftist propaganda screed , the worst of which be Louis Lapham 's bitter drivel editorial . it get to a point where the writing be incredibly predictable ; I know exactly what position -lrb- read : left of pelosus -rrb- the writer -- any writer in Harpers -- would take on whatever the issue be , and I have a pretty good idea of what the line of whine would be . if you attend dinner party on the Upper East Side ; if you drive a Prius to the Oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming be a environmental travesty ; if you have ever desecrate a Starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine be for you . however , if you be dumbfounded at how the Republicans can keep win election -- and then you realize they have the democratic party as opponent ; if you realize the genius of George Bush and Karl Rove be in get liberal to underestimate George Bush and Karl Rove ; if you want to read smart , insightful write that will inform and entertain , then try the Atlantic monthly -lrb- which , by the way , I be surprise to see reviewer describe as a liberal magazine ; I think it be moderate , and if anything , a bit on the conservative side . -rrb- needless to say , I let my Harpers subscription lapse . two star , tho , for the Harper 's Index -- however , that be not worth the price of a subscription -lrb- it get to be the only thing worth anything for the price of the subscription -rrb- .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEU	3	I absolutely hate when a magazine choose to send I multiple issue at the same time to start my subscription . I do not have time to get through 3 issue before the next one come . I be sure it be much more convenient for the publisher but in this day and age , they computer can easily keep track of when my subscription start and end . at this point , I be unlikely to renew this subscription because of this practice .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	regular reader of my review be probably get sick of I mention Kage Baker , but I have to credit she for get I to try a lot of thing that I would not normally try if she have not be a part of they . Asimov 's Science Fiction magazine be another time where this be the case . while I have buy Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine every month for a while now , I would also check Asimov 's to see if it have a Baker story . if it do , I would buy it . what I have find , however , be that I have enjoy most of the other story in the issue I have buy as well . thus , from now on I will be buy it every month too . much like Fantasy & Science Fiction , Asimov 's contain mostly science fiction story of various length -lrb- short story , novelette , novellum -rrb- along with a couple of column and some cartoon . the difference between the two be that Asimov 's contain no fantasy -lrb- though some of Mike Resnick 's story have a fantasy feel to they -rrb- . however , the magazine like to concentrate on character-based science fiction , so you will not see a lot of `` technology first , character second '' story in the magazine . personally , I think that be a good thing as hard science fiction turn I off . if you be more into the hard science , you may find stuff in here to interest you , but there be a good chance that you will not . occasionally , there will be guest editorial -lrb- they print George R.R. Martin 's Guest of honor speech from Worldcon in the October\/November issue -rrb- . there be always a `` on book '' column , sometimes write by Paul Di Filippo , sometimes by Peter Heck . the author use this column to recommend book that you may not have come across . Robert Silverberg open each issue with a `` reflection '' column that can cover everything from space exploration to idea on story-writing . James Patrick Kelly occasionally be feature with a `` on the net '' column , examine various science fiction web site and other online activity . unlike Fantasy & Science fiction , there be often some poetry include as well . finally , there be a calendar of upcome convention that cover the world so you can always find someplace to go if you need to get together with a group of fan . the bread and butter of the magazine , though , be the story . each story have a introduction from the editor -lrb- currently Gardner Dozois , though that will change to Sheila Williams with the January issue -rrb- , which may explain the genesis of the story , or just tell we how long it be be since that author have appear in Asimov 's . one of the thing about Asimov 's that be different be that it often serialize story that will eventually appear in book form . Allen M. Steele 's Coyote series have be serialize over the last couple of year with all of they be collect in two book -lrb- coyote from a couple of year ago , and the upcome Coyote rise -rrb- . also , Charles Stross ' Accelerando have be feature in recent issue . the one drawback to this be for reader who only pick up the occasional issue . for instance , `` Survivor '' in the October\/November issue do not really mean a lot because I have miss everything that come before it . it do reward regular reader , though . Asimov 's have many writer who write almost exclusively for that magazine , or at the very least the author submit they story to this magazine for first refusal . my favorite , Kage Baker , only seem to appear here , with only one story that I know of appear in realm of Fantasy . Allen M. Steele be another . Robert Reed seem to be feature everywhere -lrb- I swear that guy be churn they out like he be a machine -rrb- but he be feature a lot in Asimov 's . the magazine be bind just like Fantasy & Science fiction , however the cover be thin paper rather than thicker stock , so it will tear a bit easier . this do have the advantage that you can sometimes leave it lie open for reading -lrb- though this only work if you be toward the middle of it -rrb- . it also mean it can be roll up if necessary . the only other fault I have with it , and this be strictly a personal thing , be that the story do not always grab I as much as they do in Fantasy & Science fiction . this be mainly because I be more into fantasy than science fiction , so this certainly would not be the case for everyone . while the hit and miss ratio vary from issue to issue , I can say that I have never skip a story in the magazine . again , that be a benefit of short fiction . you be not go to waste a lot of time on they . if I have to choose between the two magazine , I would definitely choose Fantasy & Science fiction . however , Asimov 's be certainly good enough that it be easy to make room for both of they . plus , by pick they both up , I feel like I be do my part in keep short fiction alive . it be only a small part , but every little bit help .

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	first , let I say that I love get my magazine from amazon . they be easy and cheapter and there be no constant mail beg to renew at a -lrb- higher -rrb- rate . that say , I get Elle and Bazaar -lrb- $ 10 each -rrb- but forget Vogue . it use to be good-model , clothes , fashion , cut edge-and I subscribe for year . now it be celeb fluff or -lrb- the worst -rrb- some socialite with too much money complain about how she ballgown will not fit in she closet and that she pick the kid up from school and not the nanny . honestly , I be all about Carine Roitfeld and blame Anna Wintour . Roitfeld have style and Wintour lose it year ago .

'' how right she be , despite have glorious photography , fashion model that dare not stand sideways or you would not be able to see they and the occasional good article in it , I have to admit I find Vogue too pretentious . vogue want to be the voice of fashion , the voice of the high brow media but its clientele be the likes of you and I , ordinary people who can not afford to live the high life they be portray on its gloss fill page . personally I would rather spend my money on a movie ticket , I get to see a good thriller , sci-fus , romance etc , etc I do not have to know about the substence abuse and emotional demon that haunt a particular actor 's life , I be just interested in enjoy myself for a couple of hour before I go back to my hard work life in the real world . vogue be try to sell I a dream that I do not really want to buy into , never have a penchant for sell my soul to the devil , it be get two star though because the photography be really superb , shame about the rest of it though .

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I grow up read National Geographic , cherish its splendid photography and exceptional journalism . indeed , it have get better over time , offer cutting-edge story range from genetics to global warming . to its everlasting credit , National Geographic have never lose sight of the `` human element '' in its story , provide its readership with balanced reporting cover all side of a issue , often take the pulse of those affect . it be - and still remain - a exciting armchair `` explorer '' , take reader to distant locale across the globe . but now , you be as likely to read about dispose nuclear waste in the former Soviet Union as well as the people of a newly independent country in the South Pacific . one of National Geographic 's strongest strength have be its photography , and its current staff include some of today 's finest documentary photographer and photojournalist , whose work often rival that from independent photo agency such as black star and Magnum Photos . without question , this remain one of the finest magazine publish now .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	-- as the previous reviewer state , this be not a publication that have much meat to it . but I not only find fault with its ommission but also with what it do contain . if you be seek a authentically catholic perspective , look elsewhere . in its attempt to be inclusive this publication have give the name Catholic to much that be not . a good magazine be faith and Family , though it appeal more to woman . perhaps if one be look for devotional and biblical content , he could look into Magnificat .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	if you be look for catholic news , culture , spirituality , history , apologetic , liturgical update , or DOCTRINE , THIS be certainly not the magazine for you . the article feature in Cath . dig . be HETERODOX -lrb- not orthodox -rrb- , and stray -- in tendency or in explicit term -- from the magisterium of the Church . anti-christian feminism , homosexual activism , and general modernist revisionism and a rebellious `` anti-dogmalism '' pervade the page of `` Catholic '' Digest , though often -lrb- but not always -rrb- with veil language . for Catholics try to get they faith straight , or Protestants and non-Catholics try to find out more about what the christian faith be all about , stay away from this publication !!  as a cleric and a pastor of the flock of God , I strongly urge you not to purchase this magazine .  the Rev. Enzo G. Selvaggi
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I frequently change magazine subscription just to see what be out there . Harpers , however , be a staple and for the simple reason that its writing be the best and the most varied in term of length and subject matter . the real measure of its success be that I will wade into article , memoirs and discussion , whatever the subject , and find I come away with something to talk about with friend instead of a hour spend with teaser paragraph and no payoff . you know the feeling from coffee table mag where you eye wind up tired and inside you head a dull tom-tom begin to beat ... Harpers be a strange amalgam of irreverence , analysis , personal revelation and humor that put it somewhere between the New York Review of Books , the New Yorker and Mother Jones -- without the brand that the other cordon you with . check it out and be sure to read the piece not usually on you checklist . they 'll take you place you have not be .

I subscribe for a year -lrb- I have be play acoustic for 4 year -rrb- before I let my subscription lapse . why do I let it lapse ? well , for starter , the lack of a good digital edition be a factor . but more important , like all publication , Acoustic Guitar depend on advertiser for its existence . naturally , it feature review of guitar , accessory , electronics , etc. , in every issue . but , unlike in more reputable publication , these review be worthless , because they be always good review ! every guitar have a nice warm sound . every accessory would be a great Christmas gift . can you imagine if movie review be write this way -lrb- focus only on the good thing , and ignore the problem ? -rrb- Ebert would be give every movie two thumb up . or , if Consumer Reports rating every product the same -lrb- everything be a Editors ' choice ! -rrb- . the bottom line : Acoustic Guitar Magazine be a shill for its advertiser , plain and simple . -lrb- this problem seem pervasive in the music world . while Amazon be great and allow negative review , other online music store do not allow negative review . -rrb-

RiceCooker	POS	5	it do a excellent job of cooking for a single or double serve of rice while the meal be finish up . lot of complain about they break early in the first year , but after 5 month and 30 use , I have have no problem .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I guess there be not a lot of variety in how the rice end up ... although , I suppose I could try add less water ... but anyway , it be a lot easier than cooking rice from scratch . this machine work perfectly .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I really love this rice cooker . I order another after mine get beat up in a move , because I could not imagine life without it . I will not lie , I be a great cook . but for some reason , I can never seem to cook rice correctly . it always come out burnt or mushy , or I forget to make it for my chinese food altogether . this little rice cooker be TINY , so I do not mind leave it out on the counter all the time . for I and my bf , it make plenty of rice , and then some . I just pour in my rice , water and some salt , push the button and forget about it , and a little while later I have perfectly cook rice ! I have not try the little steamer tray that come with everything , but it do come with it . probably could not hold much more than a cup of veggy . the only con I can think of be that the lid can get pretty messy with the steam and froth bubble out the top , but it be easy to clean , along with the bowl . so convenient and cute ! great for 2-3 , maybe 4 people , probably not suitable for more than that .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	my friend recommend I to buy this rice cooker but the rice cooker break down just now . I buy it Dec 21 2011 ...
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be really please with this rice cooker\/slow cooker . it be simple to use and work very well . my daughter , husband and I be all use it and it be worth the counter space it take up . we have be cooking rice a whole lot more and I have also use it to make pot roast -lrb- 7 hour on the slow cooker ! -rrb- this be a great size machine for my family of three , I would recommend it for a family of four also .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have own rice cooker in the past , and my only complaint be that they be hard to clean because they have a hard-to-clean interior . this rice cooker have a wonderful non-stick surface that be easy to clean . it be fast , it be easy to use , and it make great rice ! it do not make a whole lot of rice , so you might want to get a larger model if you have a large family . I only ever make rice for myself , so this thing be perfect .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have to have a great rice cooker . not just one of those cheap one with the glass lid that almost no one in Asia have anymore , but a fancy , computerized one . so when I see this rice cooker on Amazon and see that it have a separate pot for steaming\/slow cooking , I be sell . I actually have my eye on a 5.5 cup Zojirushi cooker before , but the feature -lrb- compare to this Sanyo one -rrb- just do not compare or justify the price difference . Have have this cooker for about three month now , and have use it at least once a week -lrb- some week more , some week less ... it vary due to my schedule and pantry item -rrb- . Rice come out cleanly and evenly-cooked every time -lrb- even if I add too little or too much water -rrb- . I have be cooking jasmine rice and brown rice in here , and have be able to keep both jasmine and brown rice in the fridge for up to five day without it spoil and get too hard to eat -lrb- especially for fried rice -rrb- . I have also steamed dumpling in it , and the only complaint I have regard that be that I wish there be a better steam tray for this unit . the steam tray that come with this cooker have concave dip in it to accommodate 8 egg , and that get slightly annoying , but only from a aesthetic point of view . not really a dealbreaker ! the recipe booklet that come with this cooker have some great recipe idea . I have only try the beef rice jook recipe so far . it be a bit on the thick side -lrb- like the consistency of REALLY thick oatmeal -rrb- , but it at least give you a start point to tweak the recipe to you liking on some popular asian -lrb- mainly chinese -rrb- dish . timer function be great , if a bit confusing to remember the first few time , along with the 12-hour warming function -lrb- though I have never have to use the warming function for longer than a hour so far -rrb- . no warming function for rice porridge , but if you turn the unit off and then back on again , it will automatically stay on `` warm '' . the noise that this unit make when you food be do be also not the usual somewhat-annoying , very cheesy musical tune that a lot of other fancy rice cooker have . it be just a standard beeping noise , and not too annoying or long . overall , I could not be happier with this cooker . if I can find a better steam tray so that I can maybe steam some meal with my rice , I would be in heaven . this cooker definitely have the potential to do it all .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be well worth the price . it slow cook the rice , but it taste fantastic . I have own this cooker for two year with moderate use and have have no problem with it at all . it be the best kitchen accessory I have ever buy .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this little rice cooker\/stamer be great use it all the time . my husband love it very easy to use pefect rice all the time .
RiceCooker	POS	4	this be a 6 cup rice cooker ... right ? on page five under the head `` cooking rice '' the manual read ... `` this cooker can cook up to 1 1\/2 measure of rice and yield a maximum of about 3 cup of cook rice '' . this little statement will leave you rack you brain when you compare it to page 7 which indicate that to yield 5 1\/2 cup of cook rice you should use 3 rice meaure -lrb- each measure be 3\/4 cup -rrb- and fill the water up to the 3 cup mark . I have to call customer service to find out which be correct . the answer be that the guide on page 7 of the manual be correct . the statement on page 5 -lrb- five -rrb- be simply incorrect accord to the customer service rep. I ignore page 5 and put in 3 full measure of rice and i can verify that it yield just over 5 cup of white rice . one other note ... the rice measure have to be fill to the brim to be a full `` measure '' of rice . ignore the very pronounced ring of plastic just below the rim . it be just another confusing issue with this product . Edit : so we have be use this product for quite some time now . I have move past the mistake in the instruction . if you consider the price , this thing be darn near amazing . I can not give it 5 star since the actual yield be less than advertise . I will say that we have use this to cook flawless Quinoa -lrb- try it with seafood stock to go with you salmon -rrb- , brown Rice and white rice . we use this silly little appliance a lot . I be add a star .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have have the regular inexpensive rice cooker from wal-mart for year . they cook rice fine , or so I think . I want a rice cooker that look attractive sit out in the kitchen . I buy the aroma arc-150sb 20-cup Digital Rice Cooker and Steamer . I expect a prettier appliance that do the same job . I be so surprised when I taste my first bite of rice ! the rice be cook so well . it be fluffy , tender , not hard or mushy , but perfectly cook . it cook brown rice so well . the steamer be amazing . this appliance really steam quickly and well . it work just as well to cook rice and steam vegetable at the same time . this product really have impress I enough to take the time to write this review . it be well worth the 30-some dollar I pay for it on Amazon.com . I check e-bay and a bunch of other retailer and Amazon.com be by far the least expensive . and I get free shipping . it arrive with in two day of order . great product , great shopping service , great price !
RiceCooker	POS	4	the rice cooker work fine . it be smaller than I think . the web say it could contain 8-cup . however , customer should know that 8 cup contain of 4-cup rice and 4-cup water . so it be fit for 1-4 people .
RiceCooker	POS	5	get it for $ 100 . just use it for half a month , and still not quiet familiar with all of its function . but it do good job . I be simply satisfy .
RiceCooker	POS	4	even though the rice cooker stop work , I be still give it 4 star because it be good when it be work . after I have wash the pot , I would consistently put it back onto the cooker , so maybe the cooker have water damage from my carelessness . only thing I do not like about it be that it be not able to keep rice warm for a long while , it end up burn the food at the bottom .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I be Japanese\/American , and have eat steamed rice all my life . have own a rice cooker almost all of my adult year . this be my second Zojurishi cooker . own a Zojurishi be so way worth it . why ? it just plain cook the rice as well as it can be make . I few year ago , I relocate to a far away local and eventually purchase a run of the mill rice cooker , and never like it . finally purchase another Zojurishi and now think I be silly for the time I do not have it . full feature and cooking option be cool too . the only draw back on my current model be that it do not have a run off for excess condensation , like my other one have . this do not affect the quality of my rice , just a noticeable difference . I shop and Amazon offer a excellent price with free shipping . no brainer .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I expect it to be a little bigger than it be . but it work great . no problem so far . Hope it will last long .
RiceCooker	POS	5	product make wonderful rice , much lighter than use the stove . read problem with these rice cooker boil over . I have only make upto 2 cup of brown rice , not 3 so I be not sure if make 3 cup would cause the water overflow people seem to have . it also steam vegtable , but this model seem small to bother with .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	it be only be two week since I buy it but it be already not work ! the life span be so short !
RiceCooker	POS	5	it cook Rice and yep it work , wonderful little cooker for when you just need a cup of rice cook : -rrb-
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be my first rice cooker , so I can only compare it to cooking rice on a stove . this make perfect sticky rice . Use 1:1 japanese short grain rice\/water plus 2 tbsp of water , and 15-20 minute later you have rice you can roll into a sticky ball . I also try quinoa and it turn out perfect . I have try make that many time on the stove with average result . this rice cook be extremely small , but it be a perfect size for two people . I like it because it be small and fit in the cupboard easily , and it be very easy to clean . in the future I might upgrade to something larger and more advanced , but to be honest I do not see a need for it right now . this do a great job , and it be less than $ 15 . what be not to love about it ?
RiceCooker	NEG	2	the lid be attach to the cooker , so it be impossible to properly clean ... and the metal of the cooker be porous . I accidentally leave some vegetable in the cooker overnight . a common mistake -- usually easy to clean up after . but because of the porous metal on the inside of the lid , and the fact that it can not be unattached , it be impossible to clean the stench of rotten vegetable out of the lid . everything I make after that taste of it , until I finally have to throw the unit away . again . impossible to clean . you can not let it sit unwashed overnight , not even once . if you do -- forty dollar out the window .
RiceCooker	POS	5	although I have to admit I have only use this rice cooker in the ` Quick Cook ' mode , the rice have come out perfect each and every time . two japanese cup provide for about 4 serving of perfectly cook basmatus rice . what impress I the most be the high quality material and attention to detail in its design .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I purchase a aroma rice cooker and after I use it twice the lid would not seal . I contact the company and they never even bother to reply . lousy product , lousy customer service . waste money and time . I will never buy another aroma product .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be my second Sanyo rice cooker and its as great as the first . they be the best out there .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	the rice cooker initially work great , but after about 20 usage it start to go from cook to warm prematurely so the rice be not fully cook . it do not happen all the time once every 4-5 usage . the reason I bring this be to cook rice so I do not have to be around to watch it . be not a rice cooker suppose to cook rice automatically ? I do not know if I be the only one who be have this problem .
RiceCooker	POS	5	First off , I be chinese and be basically a life long rice eater . Rice be definitely my daily staple . I do not feel right when I do not have a bowl of rice or two in my stomach daily . therefore , I use rice cooker daily . my parent bring I up use Tiger brand rice cooker . I use to have a basic Zojirushi that I use to cook brown rice for 10 year until it finally stop work last month . great durable rice cooker , but near the end , the rice get burn on the bottom . I then buy a cheap aroma rice cooker from Walmart , but the brown rice come out hard , chewy and in one piece ! after do extensive research online and on Amazon , I decide to go with the Sanyo with fuzzy logic , since it get great review from many different website . since most Zojirushis in the US be no longer make in Japan , I figure why not get the best of both world : a reasonably price rice cooker with all the bell an whistle . I order this from Amazon Warehouse deal and the unit come literally brand spanking new . 2 nice , thick durable non-stick cooking bowl with accurate measurement on the inside for rice and water . I make a batch of brown rice and it come out great ! the timer be easy to use and work like a charm , beep when the rice be do . in the morning . I wash the rice and throw it in the cooker and set the timer to cook for dinner time . by the time I get home from work , I have a perfectly cook , tender , fluffy bowl of hot brown rice for dinner ! no burn bottom and so easy to clean , with no rice gloop to clean from the steam vent -lrb- like my old Zojirushi do -rrb- and two replaceable steam lid include . this machine be a wonder and a great deal ! you can spend mega buck on the Zoji or the Tiger , but why ?
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love my Zojirushi ! my only regret be that I do not buy the bigger one .
RiceCooker	POS	5	after research rice maker in general and automatic one in particular , I settle on the Zojirushi . I may have be prejudice a bit since I have already own one of they bread maker for several year , I use it at least once a week and I be more than satisfy with it . my experience have lead I to both trust they product and have high expectation for they . that say , I have find the rice cooker to be excellent . it do just what it say it do . I have already make several batch of white rice , brown rice and rice porridge , all do to perfection . it be simple to use and easy to clean and with the retractable power cord it store neatly and easily ; it be handle make it easy to retrieve from the lower shelf where I keep it . the direction for use could be better ; they seem to have be translate by a computer rather than a human . the direction for they bread maker be clear and easily readable , so they be capable of do better for this product .
RiceCooker	POS	5	make excellent succulent white rice . love it even better for porridge . able to use timer function , setup ingredient and porridge be perfectly make . texture be better than use slow cook pot or cooking old fashion way over the stove . I be american-chinese and I previously own a Zorushi rice cooker . do not worry about the absence of a condensation catcher on the Sanyo , as mention in some review , because it do not drip very much when you open the lid . I be delighted with this product . I buy this a month ago . my mom be visit and even she be impress with the quality of the cook rice . I will try brown rice and see if it be as impressive .
RiceCooker	POS	5	ok , I can not stand it any longer ! why be so many people freak out about the little cup ? it be 200 ml , or in between 3\/4 and 1 cup dry measure . most people eat more than they need to , it do not hurt to have a little smaller portion . and here be a secret that any of we from traditional japanese family know : put the rice in the cooker . put in enough water so that the water come up to the 2nd knuckle of you index finger -lrb- with the tip of you finger touch the top of the rice -rrb- . it always work , we use to do this in we old rice cooker that have japanese write only , it do not matter what the amount of rice be ; I do not know how\/why this work but it do , and when I meet someone that grow up eat rice everyday like I do , they all seem to know this trick . in regard to the timing-who care if the rice be do before the rest of the meal ? since there be that handy keep warm feature , just make the rice way ahead !! the reason it take longer in the rice cooker be the traditional soak time , help make softer fluffy rice . if you get stick-um on the bottom of you rice , it be prob . not a good quality , or you do not rinse it , or you need to fluff it when the timer say it be do with the cute song . they say max 4 hour for keep warm , but for about 30 year I have keep the rice warm for longer than that and have no problem with food poisoning or bacterium . if you can keep stuff warm in a crock pot all day , why not rice ? my mom be japanese and highly recommend this cooker . for those interested in ayurvedic food , it make great kitcharee -lrb- although not the soupy kind , put you spice and veggy and dahl right in with the rice , if you add too much water it cook until the water be steam out , take about 45 min . -rrb- I love my big Zojirushi cooker so much I be buy this smaller one for at work so I can have my hot soup or rice cooking and ready by mealtime !
RiceCooker	NEU	3	this small appliance change my life for one month until the slow cooker inner pot peel , crack and be render useless . prior to the pot give out , the product be great . I be steam and cook on alternate day make rice , quinoa and polenta in the rice cooker and a variety of slow cooker recipe . I can still use the rice cooker pot and be try to track down a replacement slow cooker inner pot ; part be not in stock with Sanyo US service center and Sanyo be unapologetic that they product crap out after a month of use . from amazing to annoying .
RiceCooker	POS	4	after read several review , I purchase one so that I would not have to watch over rice cooking . my mom come to visit , taste the brown rice & love it . I buy a second one as a gift for she .
RiceCooker	POS	4	first time work great ! need to adjust the water depend on the type of rice . Easy to do and great to have rice soooo easy .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	EMPTYSTRING
RiceCooker	POS	4	this rice cooker be right appropriate for I and my roommate , and it look so cute . I expect it would last long .
RiceCooker	POS	5	my wife and I have be very happy with this rice cooker . we frequently cook brown rice with it , and there be just no comparison to the messy inconsistent stove-top method . we cook 1 1\/2 cup each time -lrb- which seem to be the optimal amount -rrb- and get restaurant quality rice ! we have also use this rice cooker to cook quinoa -lrb- for which it work very nicely , just use the `` white rice '' setting -rrb- . it do not work as well , in my experience , for porrige or oatmeal - which we continue to cook on the stove . regardless , we have find this a invaluable addition to we kitchen appliance arsenal . I highly recommend it .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have a aroma rice maker , and it be ok , but this zojirushus be far , far better . no crust bottom , and the rice be truly perfect . very easy to use , very easy to clean and a perfect amount of rice for a two people household . Worth the money definitely . I have a zojirushus Breadmaker also and I be sell on this brand . Superior quality and performance in both appliance .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Worth the money -- perfect rice every time ! produce restaurant-quality rice , turn out nice and fluffy to perfection . I have cook from 1\/2 cup of rice to 3 cup of rice perfectly on this machine . the unit 's automatic keep-warm function keep rice at a ideal serve temperature until it be ready to be serve . the appliance come equip with a extra-large color lcd display with clock and timer function , a spherical inner nonstick cooking pan and heating system , a convenient detachable inner lid for easy cleaning , and a built-in retractable cord and clear-coated stainless-steel exterior . very easy cleanup . cook many different type of rice include white , sushi , porridge , brown , and quick cooking . accessory include a measure cup , nonstick rice spatula , and spatula holder .
RiceCooker	POS	5	apart from be the smallest rice cooker I have ever see it be still good for 2 people ...
RiceCooker	POS	4	we be pretty happy with the rice cooker - we want to eat more brown rice , but the time it take to cook means we never can do it on a work night -lrb- which for we be 6 day a week -rrb- . be able to throw it together on the way out the door and have it be ready when we come back in be fully worth the $ $ . have not try anything but brown rice so far , but we be thrill . my rating would go up if the instruction manual be a little better write - it be a bit vague and make it seem harder than it be . however , once you figure out how to do it , it be really simple , especially because it save you 2 favorite time for rice to be finish .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I love the convenience of this Panasonic rice cooker . though I have not steam vegetable during the rice cooking cycle use the steamer insert that come with it , I think it be a useful feature . the steam escape in several place and there be a side reservoir that you need to empty after each use . the steam come out of the top do make quite a mess , so be sure to have some paper towel handy . I love the retractable cord . all the rice I have make have turn out great . I highly recommend this rice cooker .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I never really think of myself as someone who make rice a lot , but I always hate make it on the stove . I look into a few rice cooker on amazon and see they be all pretty poorly review , except this one . this be the best appliance I have ever purchase , bar none . it make it so easy to get restaurant-quality rice in about 30-45 minute -lrb- depend on if you use the `` quick '' setting or not -rrb- , and rice become a variable that you do not need to worry about while prepare you dinner . it be just there and ready for you when you need it . I be not a great cook , but this thing be idiot proof . it be worth spend the money on it , I use it all the time and do not regret the purchase price one bit . buy one if you even remotely love have rice with meal , you will not regret it .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	this product be terrible . it last 1 month and it be not work anymore . definitely not buy this product . I be very very disappointed .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy this rice cooker on one of the lightning deal from Amazon , but after use it , would pay triple if I ever have to replace it . it be a tiny rice cooker , but it be perfect for multiple type of rice , quinoa and oatmeal . I use the cooker every morning to make a single serve of oatmeal . the device be really a set-and-go sort of thing , and automatically shut off when the rice or grain be 15 minute from be ready . as I say in the title for this review , I be guess this be go to be my best purchase of 2011 .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the best thing ever , WE MADE SUSHI and the RICE come out perfect and so do the sushi , it be everthe they say it be and more we steam vegtable with fish in it and it be great . thank you .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	we purchase this item but then find it to be not what we expect . this rice cooker make up to 16 cup . in other word you put in 7 cup of dry rice which end up make 16 cup . it say this in the description but title be just a little misleading . other than that , it be a rice cooker and work as such . I know I probably should not rate it on my human error of not read the full description but the title be a little misleading .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I do a lot of research before buy this and have have it for several month now . this rice cooker be great . Perfect rice every time ; white , brown , wild , rice of any kind . Easy to use , durable , easy to clean , compact , look good , a good user experience -lrb- the designer be think when they make this -rrb- . thing to be aware of : it take a while to cook the rice - over a hour for brown rice . also , porridge in Japan be a soup like substance so if you want the non-watery north american kind you will need to adjust the porridge to water ratio . if I remember correctly it be 1:2.5 ratio of porridge to water .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I never really eat much rice but this make really tasty rice like restaurant serve , its so easy , just measure , and put in water and hit start . do not forget to wash the rice ... actually so far I have make more bread than rice , the bread rock ... yeah it take a little time to mix flour , etc but its worth it , I have even start experiment with put chunk of cheese , tomato and rosemary in the bread , etc. . its so yummy . I want to try brown rice soon . the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bab set make a really moist stew type meal . I be glad I get it . it have turn I into a better cook which be not easy .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	this be a very nice steamer . but the cup measurement be NOT we cup measure so when it say steam 3 cup it actually do about 2 -lrb- maybe be asian cup size -rrb- so this be not a good size for a average family of 4 .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	last about 2 week . we use it twice , then the light would not turn off . we unplug and plug back in , will not turn on at all . I do not know how it happen . I have the red rival one that look just like it . last 6 year . this one , 2 week . junk . do not buy this one .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be a big fan of this rice cooker . it be compact , make perfect rice every time , and keep it warm as long as you need without dry it out . I have use it for white , brown , basmatus , and wild rice as well as smaller grain like quinoa . it be very easy to use and clean .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	from the very first time I use the aroma rice cooker , the switch for `` cook '' would move to the `` warm '' position within the first minute of cooking . I would catch it and push it back to `` cook '' . after about 5 use the switch completely break and I could not set it to anything . I have to say that if I do not have this problem I would have keep the cooker because the rice come out great and we enjoy it . I return it to Amazon and actually order the same one again . I guess my thinking be what would be the odds of get another one like that . well I guess I get the jackpot because the new one also have the same switch problem . I say , `` enough be enough '' and pick a Sanyo rice cooker . I do see in the review that someone else have the same problem with they aroma rice cooker , just think it be one-of-a-kind issue , guess not !
RiceCooker	POS	5	I havnt try white rice yet but brown rice come out perfect . I even put to much liquid I think , and it still come out great . brown rice do take a long time in it but I dont mind since it come out so awesome . I add chicken broth instead of water and small diced chicken . the entire pot be go within 20 minute . when I try white rice I will add more to my review .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I purchase this rice cooker over a year ago and use it about two time a week . Wether I cook white rice or brown , long grain or short grain , the rice come out perfect every time . the rice be the perfect moisture and consistency . it be great too that it automatically change to the keep warm function upon finish . this be really nice , allow you to have one less item that you have to worry about timing for . clean the rice cooker be easy too . the bowl that the rice cook in be easily clean with a soft sponge and some dish soap . the rest of the cooker can be clean with just a rag or paper towel , there will be some moisture and excess water that need to be wipe up . I be so happy with my rice cooker I just buy a second to gift to the mom for mother day .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I receive this rice cooker as a present , and I love it ! it cook the rice perfectly and steam the vegetable well . I have not try to cook meat it in , as I be a vegetarian , but it work great for what I need . I do add extra water when steam vegetable while cooking rice . I have cook asparagus , brussels sprout , and zucchini in this while also cooking rice . I have notice it sputter a little , but mine do not make a big mess as other reviewer have notice . I love that I can switch it on and walk away until ready to eat !
RiceCooker	POS	5	the rice cooker work as advertise . it require nothing except put in rice and water , plug in , and rice come out few minute later . it have quite a large capacity , probably capable of handle up to 10 people 's dinner rice . I only use for two people , and it be slightly bigger than what I need . otherwise , it be a reliable product for a pretty cheap price .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	so the positive about this cooker be that it make any steamed food very well . you can make rice , potato , throw in some veggy , and it all steam very well . very easy to make a one-pot meal . however , very few rice cooker will not do this . I like that there be not any fancy feature that make cooking difficult , the simplicity be good appeal . that say , if you do not wash you rice first you will wind up with starchy water spew all over you counter . I only fill this to the bare minimum to avoid this problem and I thoroughly wash my long-grained white rice -lrb- something you should do for better quality rice anyway -rrb- . I also have some serious problem with sticking after I finish cooking . I have try everything I can to get that crispy layer out and it ruin my sponge . I put in some oil , I spray the side , I have really try everything . it still stick ! I like the simplicity , hate the mess .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the most amazing appliance I have in my kitchen ! I do ton of research on steamer and then I find this , it have almost all positive review and the price be fair . I use this to steam fruit and vegetable for my daughter when she start eat solid and it work wonderfully ! I can also cook rice and chicken with vegetable at the same time , and dinner be do in 30 minute . also I make a fritatta the other morning in 15 minute and it taste so good ! I highly recommend this !
RiceCooker	POS	4	for the new year resolution to lose weight , I be cut down on starch food . the Zojirushi rice cooker be perfect for that reason . . set the program be simple and you be able to set it in the morning for whenever you wish it to be ready for you meal ...
RiceCooker	NEG	2	pro : small footprint , proper capacity for two people , quick cooking function for those time where you be in a hurry . con : it do not store rice for more than 8-12 hour without the rice get yellowed . we have a huge , ancient , dented , simple Zojirushi before get the Sanyo that could hold the rice for at least two day before it yellowed . with the Sanyo , you would better refrigerate any leftovers immediately . after a year , the Sanyo fail to work . the last pot be a horrific rice paste with dry grain on the surface . overall : it have a lot of software bell and whistle that do not help it make proper rice and apparently detract from that core ability . but hey , I like to use it to make rice on a daily basis , so if you want to use it to cook frozen bread dough or non-sticky rice with olive oil , go ahead and buy into the review here .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	do not bother with this one ... First off , I ' t do not even make 3 cup of rice , more like 1.5 cup . the first and only time I use it , the rice come out mushy . I assume it be user error , the second time I try to use it , it would not even turn on . I be rating it one star because that be as low as I can go
RiceCooker	POS	5	we buy this rice cooker from a store whose name rhyme with `` Halmart '' . think that we know how to cook rice , we load it up and fire away , only to get a tremendous mess of starchy goop that flood the top of the unit and flow down the side , collect underneath . -lrb- it stink and the stink get worse if you forget that it be there ... -rrb- after read review for other aroma rice cooker here on Amazon , I discover that soak the rice fix everything . and very fortunately , this unit come with a delay timer . just load the cooker with rice and water -lrb- measure , of course -rrb- , press `` Delay Timer '' for the number of hour you would like to delay -lrb- the number be the number hour when the rice will be finish -rrb- , and choose `` white rice '' or `` brown rice '' -lrb- brown rice be give we the most mess -rrb- . I have set the timer as little as 2 hour , and the mess be eliminate even then . I believe that more delay be better . I have set it as long as 12 hour . I do not know the maximum number of hour you can delay . con for this rice cooker : there be a plastic valve inside the lid that need to be clean often , and the underside of the lid need to be clean as well . it do not detach , so you 'll have to scrub with a wet paper towel . I have not try to steam anything yet -lrb- fish , veggy -rrb- . bottom line : I recommend this product .
RiceCooker	POS	4	ok . so I buy this because I really have to watch my food intake . so the rice cooker do a awesome job of steam the rice and veggy . I have steam beet in this and man they be awesome ! I give it 4 star because sometimes it be awesome if it have a on\/off switch . other than that it really be a great rice cooker . I be happy with this purchase . oh and ive have this rice cooker now for almost close to 1 year . so yes its pretty darn awesome .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I first buy a cheap-o cooker from target and it be junk . burn the first batch of rice . drop it in the recycle bin and start my research and even think the price be far more than what I have pay for the cheap-o from target , I absolutely do not regret it . Perfect brown rice ever time ... well worth the price .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I buy this Rice Cooker so I would be able to make rice with out worry about it . SO ... why would I want to go back after 15 minute and stir ? also the steam spout spew water all over . I can do that on the stove top with out any help ! I return this item and will try again with another one .
RiceCooker	POS	4	the aroma arc-150sb 20-cup Digital Rice Cooker\/Food Steamer work best for serve 2 to 4 people at a time . if you try to cook one cup of rice or oatmeal , it can do it but you must monitor it . if you do not eat rice , oatmeal , or steamed food , this will likely be a space consuming dust collector to you . I try cook rice and oatmeal , steam garden vegetable -lrb- carrot , broccoli , squash -rrb- , and baked a batch of brownie . the brownie be make directly in the `` rice basket '' and need to be monitor . I think it would have work better with a double-batch . no hard section of the brownie . as I usually need for only one or two people , I have mix feeling about get lesser result for small quantity . it be necessary to go with this size to have steamer basket capability -lrb- my primary need for the unit -rrb- . when you cook for 2 to 4 , it work very well . fuzzy logic make the unit versatile . it be not a re-warmer . -lrb- the unit take time to warm up and require moisture . you will waste time and electric and probably not like the result . -rrb- it be not a slow cooker . accept it . the unit have be easy to clean , and I have not have the horrible pasty mess that other rice cooker make . then again , I have alternate what I cook . maybe steam between cooking starchy food help . this cooker\/steamer do what it claim to do and do it well .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	the description be mislead . it have a capacity for 3 cup of cook rice , which be less than 1 cup of uncooked rice . this be a toy , not even make enough rice for 1 person . do not buy it .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I get this rice cooker for my 84 year old grandma . she need a small , basic cooker with a nonstick interior for easy clean-up -- nothing fancy , no multiple setting or button . it be perfect for she . the only drawback be the fact that the nonstick interior be dark , so it be difficult to see the line which tell you where to fill the water . -lrb- again -- it be for my grandma -- other might not have a problem here -rrb- . she say she like it , and it be a snap to clean up .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have use and own several rice cooker . this be a very reliable model with good capacity . it make really good rice . be sure not to lose the measure `` cup '' because it be smaller than a regular cup measure . I do not think you can cook brown rice and I never have -lrb- I think you need the fuzzy logic cooker to do that -rrb- . this rice cooker should last several year .
RiceCooker	POS	5	the first day i get this , I make white rice . it be as fluffy and amazing as the best resturant rice . the second day , I make brown rice . it be the first time I have ever enjoy brown rice . it be more flavorful and have a more enjoyable texture than white rice -lrb- but only when make properly -rrb- . the zj make rice flawlessly , and every batch come out the same . I just put in rice and water and set the timer , then I wake up to perfect brown rice for breakfast . the only annoyance be the lack of a count-down timer . but that be no reason to avoid this cooker . just buy it . do not fret about the price . it be worth it for the convenience , reliability , and health benefit .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I think I could trust the Black and Decker name ... not so . this useless piece of equipment stop work after two use . when I call the customer care number -lrb- the bold black number on the front of my Rice Cooker user manual that say customer service -rrb- I be tell it be a company that offer customer reward . think I have misdial , I call back ... same result . I explain I do not want any reward offer , just want to talk to customer support . they cave I a toll free number ... turn out it be a 1-800 number directory number . . not B&D; support . I give up since I do not think this item warrent any more waste time . I 'll be cooking rice the old-fashioned way , unfortunately .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have use many rice cooker before so i know a good one when i see it . it be a excellent choice for people who do not want to cook a huge quantity of rice at one set or for those who want to eat fresh cook rice every day . it have a warm setting to keep the cook rice warm as long as it be plug in , a excellent feature . at this price , this product can not be beat .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have not baked bread as of yet , but the rice cooker function work great , much better than the $ 25 machine it replace . I like the quality of this unit because you can tell it be well build unlike the other
RiceCooker	POS	5	it be so beautiful and fit girl ! i think it be enough for a college student ! I like it very much !
RiceCooker	POS	5	make lovely soup , stew and roast with ease . Digital programming allow you to set the timer , go to work , and come home to a tasty meal that have be keep warm for you . Rice cooker be also great : rice come out perfect every time -lrb- since you choose how you want it -rrb- , and stay warm . most importantly , the rice be still edible the next day in the cooker . the combination of these two function -lrb- slow cooker and rice cooker -rrb- save space in my already too cluttered kitchen . the one caveat be that it do require two different interchangeable pot and lid , so you still need to make room in you cupboard for the pot and lid not be use .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	just have the second one of these die after only 3 or 4 use , same as the first . a false economy to go this cheap . I 'll be look for another brand .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Rice be something that be make at least once a week in my household . previous to purchase the Sanyo ecj-hc55 rice cooker , I have a simple Oster rice cooker that do a adequate job . it only have a toggle switch that cook the rice . it make pretty good white and brown rice , but there be also some issue with it . the bowl be lightweight and the non-stick coating be flake off . also , when the unit signal that the rice be cook , the top would be fine , but the bottom would be crusty and almost burnt and stick to the bottom . I finally get feed up and start look on Amazon for a replacement . I be pretty set on pick a Zojirushi model from all of the positive review I read on not only Amazon but other website as well . as I be browse , this Sanyo model catch my eye . it look pretty sleek with its metal face and top while the rest of the body be white . after read the review for it and compare the feature in a similarly price Zojirushi model , I decide to take the plunge and pick up the Sanyo . what a amazing little machine . the construction be solid , the bowl for the rice be heavy and well make . the unit have all kind of setting for the various type of rice . in addition , the unit come with another lid insert and another bowl to do slow cooking in the unit . it also come with a plastic insert that state it be for make tofu . not sure if I will ever use that , but I do like that I have the option . the rice it make be perfect , be not too mushy or too firm . the rice do not stick to the bottom of the bowl at all . it be just simply the best rice I ever make . as soon as the rice finish cooking , it switch over to a warming mode that state it can keep the rice warm for 12 hour . in addition , the rice can be place in the bowl with water in the morning and a timer set so that you have cook rice when you return from work . while the unit do chime when the rice be cook so that I be alert , when start the cycle , it do not give a estimate of the amount of time that it take to cook . however , that one minor drawback would not stop I from recommend this unit to anyone else look for a affordable unit to make perfect rice .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I pick the Sanyo ecj-hc55 base on the positive review on Amazon and because it come with a second bowl and lid . if you be look to use you rice cooker for more than just make rice , I strongly recommend this model , which cost about $ 10 more than the model with a single bowl . the second bowl allow you to make flavored rice dish , without leave any flavor behind to flavor you plain rice . both pot be very heavy , allow for very even cooking and no burning . cleanup be also very easy , due to the very effective , non-stick coating and the easily removable lid . as with most rice cooker in this category and price point , it do a excellent job on rice . measure you rice with the include cup , give it a rinse , add water to the measure inside the `` rice '' bowl , select the appropriate program -lrb- white rice in regular , firm , and soft , brown rice , sushi rice , porridge , etc -rrb- and you be reward with perfect rice in about a hour . there be also a nice countdown timer for the last 10 minute . once the rice finish and move to the `` keep warm '' setting , you rice stay great for hour , nice and moist with perfect temperature . so far we have use this cooker for white and brown rice , as well as jambalaya , paellum , lemon rice and rice and sausage . you can saute vegetable right in the cooker , before add the rice , to make complete meal right in the cooker . just use the `` Quick Cook '' program to heat the cooker up immediately , saute you veggy , then add rice and liquid and reset to a normal program -lrb- white or brown rice -rrb- and the cooker do the rest .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I never review product , but with this , I just have to . I be a non-cook and purchase this for three simple thing . steel cut oatmeal , brown rice , and perfect hard cook egg . this rice cooker do not dissapoint . its easy to use . clean up be a snap . I will never have to throw out egg again , because of my fail cooking skill . it will only do a small serve of the steel cut oats . half a cup of oats and two cup of water on the porridge set overnight . a batch bigger than that and it will boil over . so if you need more oats than that the bigger model may be best . Quinoa come out perfect also , use the white rice setting and the measurement and direction on the quinoa bag\/box . just do not add more liquid than the highest white rice line in the bowl , again boilover issue . my only small wish , be that the end of cycle timer be a little louder , if you be not right there with it , you may not hear it . definately five star , I would rate it higher if I could .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Panasonic do they homework ! Perfect rice in 30 minute . no over-boil spillage . not worry about teflon . if that do not kill we , something else will . just wish i do not have to unplug it if i want to stop the " keep warm " feature . a old rice cooker have the ability to just push the " lever " up to power off . but i will not take a star away for that , ut i will probably want to in the future if i move the plug into a less desirable spot haha
RiceCooker	POS	4	all these great review ... I do not get it . I have try several way to try and make rice without success . whether its a half cup or a whole it take well over 1.5 hour to cook and I end up with moush . a few minute in the microwave come out so much better . I should have return it when I have the chance . 6\/23\/2010 Update . for those who have request I update my review ... yes I do use top quality rice and I do rinse it first , but what I have find be you need to play with the quantity of water inorder to make good rice . both the rice and Zojirushi say to use a 1:1 ratio of water and rice , but I have find it need to be closer to 1.25:1 water to rice . now that I have find the correct ratio it do cook rice well ... I just wish it be quicker than a hour and a half .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the best rice cooker i have ever own . its easy to use and make wonderful rice . I make steel cut oats every morning and brown rice every night . I just set it at night and its ready for breakfast and then put brown rice in and set it for when I get home from work . I would highly recommend this rice cooker if you a rice `` expert '' and appreciate the taste and texture of well cook rice . BEST KITCHEN APPLIANCE EVER .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	update 12\/10 : I have have this cooker for a year now and be ready to pass it on and get a better one . initially I think it be fine , but I be tired of pot of rice with a crust at the bottom or hard-ish grain . this cooker be basically a hot plate . like the Scarecrow : it have no brain . it do not sense you rice , and it do not make any adjustment . the fancier and more expensive pot do . I be glad I have it for a year , so I could realize that I like have a rice cooker , and I 'll be glad when this one be go and I have a better one . original review : I be not give this rice cooker 5 star because I just can not get \* that \* excite about it . hey , it be just a rice cooker . but it do exactly what it be suppose to do and do it reliably . it be a great size for my family of 2 adult and 2 child , although , like other I be pretty surprise when I see how small the bowl be . to answer some specific concern of reviewer : the rice do not stick in the least , and I have not have it get brown and crusty on the bottom ; I have not have any problem with a starchy mess come out the steam hole ; brown rice need a bit more water -lrb- as it say in the instruction -rrb- and come out just fine . the instruction say that the cooker will take between 20 minute for a small amount of white rice to 60 minute for the largest amount of brown rice . I make a full pot of short-grain brown rice just last night , and I be sure that it do not take 60 minute . in addition , once cooking be complete , the cooker automatically switch to a warm cycle , and the rice can be hold in this way for up to 5 hour .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love the black and Decker Rice Cooker . it be perfect size and easy useage be the reason why I make a second purchase of this item . it would make a great gift for a college student or a wedding gift for sure . the seller provide excellent service .
RiceCooker	POS	5	it do great rice , that be probably be cover in other review . it also do steel cut oats , with 3:1 water ratio on the porridge setting . the timer function allow you to set the time that it finish cooking , so oatmeal can be ready when you wake up . you can even put the cooker on high and toast the oats in butter before you add water . it also do lentil curry . same porridge setting , delicious result . quinoa with frozen vegetable can be do with the quick cook setting . add some broth or bullion cube for much-needed flavor . so there you have it . it be pretty versatile , once you learn how to use it , creativity will get you far .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I like to look at review so I provide they . this rice cooker be amazing . when the rice cook you just walk away and do . you rice be ready . Pretty easy to clean . Make you you pay attention to the rice measurement and steam veggy , it do a great job as well .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I do a lot of research prior to choose the Zojirushi rice cooker and luckily for I by the time I be ready to purchase the company have come out with this model ns-vgc05 which be very compact and perfect for one person or even two . it do a amazing job of cook the rice to perfection . the instruction be easy to follow especially for be a novice . I be anxious to try the different setting for different rice and cake . I call the company to find out about the build in clock . the instruction do not explain whether you have to have the unit plug in to recharge the clock . the answer be that you do not have to have it plug in . it be a lithium battery that have a 5-6 year life and then you would call the company directly to have it replace . the clean up be really easy again by follow the instruction . I highly recommend this product . it be definitely worth the money pay !!!
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I do not like thing that require lot of clean up after . I buy this so I could have rice cooking and not have to pay much attention to it if I be interrupt by kid etc. . first time use , I do 1 cup measure of brown rice use the enclosed cup , and fill to the 1 mark line for water on the pot per the instruction . click cook and go about cook the rest of my meal . 10 minute later and there be splattering of starchy water out of the little vent hole in the lid . everywhere - for a 1 foot radius around the entire cooker . I unplug it , clean it up , start again with only a half cup measure of rice , and water to the appropriate line . same thing . Splatter everywhere . this time I have a towel underneath it and let the rice finish cooking . it be perfectly cook at least . I then attempt steel cut oatmeal overnight use the warm function . that do not splatter and make for creamy wonderful oatmeal first thing in the morning . right now I be do a 1\/4 cup measure of barley with water to the 1\/2 mark line -lrb- since barley require a little more water than rice -rrb- . it be splatter on Cook . I think this will be delegate to only oatmeal or other hot cereal on warm . the Cook function cause the boil-over or splattering and therefore clean up . not sure if I 'll be try another rice cooker .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have have my Sanyo cooker for just over a week now and have use it just 3 time . must say that the first 2 cup of rice be cook to perfection . no overcooked bottom in this little beauty . . second batch just like the first . . try the delay time and it go just great . just the fact that it cook to perfection and then keep it warm all night for rice cereal in the morning make this a winner in my book . Hope it hold up for many year . . my old rice cooker be now retire after 10 year of service . . I be just tire of the crusty bottom layer of rice ...
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be very pleased with this product . I do all that I need . Great for one person and the rice be perferctly cook
RiceCooker	POS	5	very good cooker better than one I use to have that last a few month . so far this one have be very good , great buy , ty amazon
RiceCooker	POS	5	the cooker work rather well . I think because it be so cheap that it might not work well . it do the job and it be easy clean up because the lid and the rice pan come right off . some cooker have the lid attach and they be more difficult to clean .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have this for about five month now and so far its hold up good . I test it with the 2d maglite and the 4d maglite and there be never any problem the snap button have never get loose . but when i do receive my package the packaging for it be really greasy .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have 6 of they and one in my car . I give one to my mom . I tell she you use to hit someone over the head if you need to lol I tell she also if there be ever a fire use it to brake out the window with it . one of mine be at least 13 year old . sure you be spend a little more for maglite but they last for ever . I have drop mine from about 30 foot the dam thing still work great . this week i pick up 10 pack of d battery with spring come up and bad weather .
Flashlight	POS	4	as a goverment Motor Vehicle Inspector and use many flash light over 16 year this be the best ever . the DOT would not be the same without it .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have be work night shift highway patrol work for go on 19 year . I be still use the same rechargeable mag Lite that I be issue in 1990 -lrb- the same model as list here -rrb- . I have wear out half a dozen squad car , and receive a new mounting\/charger bracket with each new car , but always keep the same flashlight . I have have to replace the little rubber button over the switch a couple of time as my thumb wear through it finally . but the light be the same one I be originally issue . it be very , very bright and completely reliable . it have be drop -lrb- if you drop it switch on , it will probably knock the bulb dead -rrb- , submerge , chill to 17 below and 150 above , and switch on\/off literally ten of thousand of time . it be have a few high speed ride outside lay on the air intake below my windshield wiper . I have knock out car window with it , have use it as a impact weapon , and have even use the butt end for a hammer . I have work numerous squad car crash , and have never see a instance of a maglite that have jump out of its mount bracket due to a crash . there be room in the endcap to keep a spare bulb tuck in a piece of foam or napkin . the bulb last a long time and be easily replace . the battery stick last a long time -lrb- about 2 hour on a charge -rrb- and it be as easy to replace as change any flashlight battery . if you use the light for public safety work -lrb- police , fire , EMS , security -rrb- , and keep it in you in-car mount\/charger bracket , you will likely never see it go dim ... until it reach end of life , which be every couple of year with heavy use . it be big enough to use for self-defense , and can easily be carry on a duty belt by slip it though the handcuffs carry there , or you can use a ring make for that purpose , or just slip it inside you beltline behind you back . and -lrb- this be important -rrb- it be big enough to be carry by tuck it under you armpit , thus leave both hand free . you can not do that with small flashlight . it be also big enough not to be easily lose in the grass in the dark , like some of the hi-tech minus flashlight . I like this light so much that about 10 year ago I purchase another one out of pocket and mount the charger on the workbench in my garage . that have turn out as equally successful as my shop flashlight . when you buy this kit , you 'll get one charger\/mounting sleeve that you can mount in either home or car , and they include the proper electrical hardware to power it up by plug into either home or car power source . that be my experience . this thing be a workhorse and I consider it a `` partner '' at work . I highly recommend it .
Flashlight	POS	4	for my use this work great . so far I have not have any issue get the light it in or out , it do hit the on button sometimes and make the light flash when you pull it out . I have not break it in yet , and the button to close it be very tight , it take a really firm tug to open it , I assume it will eventually get easier , if not too easy to open . if you pack a flashlight every day you might want one deign for that , but if you like I and just pack it on you person occasionally -lrb- camp trip , hunting , fishing ... -rrb- this work fine .
Flashlight	POS	5	I already have 2 of these for 4 yr . buy these for additional location and great price . good design , rugged , flexible beam , easy to see , interchangeable rechargeable battery .
Flashlight	NEG	2	the quality be great and it be easy to operate . I buy a couple of these as keychain light . however , the light output even with a fresh battery really be not sufficient for my use .
Flashlight	POS	5	I purchase this product to be use by a entire division of over 25 personel onboard a NAVY vessel . in the workspace , temperature be always over 100 degree , and the flashlight have be drop numerous time on steel deck . the Maglight have even be submerge in oily water , and I have not have one problem with it .
Flashlight	POS	5	great product . i look in all my local store and could only find a 14.4 volt bulb so i look here and sure enuf they have just what i be lookin for !
Flashlight	POS	5	for a small flashlight that use aa 's , this thing be bright . I also like that additional and useful accessory that you can purchase separately .
Flashlight	NEU	3	this be the great flashlight for the cost . it be very bright , and the focus beam be very useful . they claim it be waterproof . I drop mine in water and it still work , kind-of . it be very dim and practically useless . grant , it sit in the water for about 5 minute , and it have a ph of 11 , so I think it go beyond the intended exposure . it 'll last forever in you garage , but if you be buy it for industrial use , do not expect it to last forever .
Flashlight	NEG	2	I have a 3-d cell and a 2-aa lead maglight as well as a 2-aa regular maglight . my complaint with the 2-aa maglight , whether lead or regular bulb be that they do not hold they charge . I have keep both 2-aa maglight in my car , and barely use it , yet the battery get drain . the 2-aa maglight be not good with battery life when you have it store for several month . I have also store my 2-aa non lead flashlight in my house , and same problem , the battery get drain and I barely use the darn thing . but I guess that be why the maglight be so much cheaper than say streamlight or the other high end flashlight . the 3-d cell lead maglight however be great , battery life hold when store in the house for month , and when use it it do not die on you and keep its brightness .
Flashlight	POS	5	great size and light power . . I use flashlight for work and this 3 c battery model have be my favorite for year .
Flashlight	NEU	3	this flashlight be construct to the same high standard as the other maglite that I have use . however , the beam quality be not as good as my d and aa maglite . it provide a good spot focus but the wide-angle beam be very non-uniform , which can make see where you be walk at night difficult . I have find the beam quality of the 2AA Maglite to be much superior for walk outside after dark .
Flashlight	POS	5	I need one of these to have my flashlight with I when work ... really cumbersome carry it in my backpocket ... especially when one have to do any climbing or co into crouch position . the clasp be very sturdy leather and the actual holder seem to be a hard plastic type material which can fold up against the clasp , conveniently , when not in use .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have a five d-cell maglite since 1986 and it be still work great ; I have only have to replace two lamp within that time . I be a scoutmaster for year and the boy call my flashlight , `` the Sun '' . when they would try to sneak off I could always find they ... the flashlight light up the whole mountain or I could narrow the beam and spot a boy nearly a mile away . I buy this six-celled maglite because I be tire of always have a lone battery with my five-celled light because battery be not package in odd number . that in fact be my recommendation to you to buy a six-cell maglite rather than a five-cell so you do not have a odd battery go to waste . I now have two great flashlight one be under my bed and the other be on my refrigerator where they be always available for emergency and light up the whole dang town if I have too : - -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have Maglite 's for many year . this be a gift for my kid and I be amaze at how bright these light shine . it be compact and the candle light feature be a nice touch which be actually extremely practical for outside dining on camping trip .
Flashlight	NEG	2	the Mag-Lite Solitaire be well design and well make but simply be not bright enough . however , if all you use a flashlight for be look for you key under the seat of you car or assist with read menu , it may be ok . it have a sleek design , and it be appeareance will not draw attention on a keychain . it function like any other -lrb- large -rrb- minus mag light , by twist the end where the light come out to turn it on and off . Change the battery by unscrew the other end . a spare bulb be conceal within the end cap . pro : - it be small . - it be well make , with all component fitting together smoothly , and a clean simple appearence . con : - it be just not that bright . some of the newer led flashlight be of a similar size but much brighter . overall , I would have to give this one a pass , unless I develop a fetish for small , well design gadget -lrb- like watch , watch be SOOO cool ! and miniature sextent , those thing be sooo neat ! -rrb- . ok , so I have this fetish , and this would explain why I have a Solitaire in my toolbox .
Flashlight	NEU	3	due to its rigid aluminum construction any form of shock absorb by the light , generally from a fall at hip level or even a roll out of the truck door , will kill the bulb . I have be tell the lead version of this light be a better option as the LED 's be more durable . personally after own a few of these I find they to be over rate . they be to heavy , the beam be very weak when its widen and very small and bright when focus . I find there be no good in between . in my opinion you can get just as good performance with a smaller 2d mag light of even the aa version .
Flashlight	POS	4	so far this be a great tool to expand the use of we 18v tool battery . I wish that DeWalt would update the tool with either a lead lamp or a Xenon lamp opion becuase the lamp it use be neither super bright nor super efficient .
Flashlight	POS	5	the item be ship and arrive within a few day . the replacement battery work great for my mag light .
Flashlight	POS	5	as a firefighter for over 40 year , I can say the mag-charger be one of the most dependalbe light I have ever use . my original , which I use for 15 year , be lose at a incident scene . I immediately order a new one . I have replace the battery stick only one time . it be mount in my vehicle and be always charge and ready to go . the service time from one charge be more that adequate for most incident . I highly recommend this product .
Flashlight	POS	4	few flashlight will grab more attention than a 6d cell maglite . it be 20 '' long and weigh well over 3 lb with battery . as allude in other review , this really gun for the guy instinct . it be exaggerated and give the same feeling as see the volume go to 11 -lrb- a la spinal tap -rrb- . ever since I first see one on display 20 year ago , I have want it -lrb- but have to settle for a Mini-Mag -rrb- . of course , as a Maglite , it live up to they reputation of be virtually indestructable and a good substitute for a baseball bat . however , in light of recent innovation in led technology , it do not have as much practical value . as one would expect with a 6d -lrb- 9 volt -rrb- light , it be one that can signal satellite . when I first see it , it be brighter than anything else , at least operating from standard battery . 20 year later , it still use the same technology , albeit with the availability of the Xenon `` mag-num '' bulb , which add 23 % brightness -lrb- per Maglite 's web site -rrb- . other technology have emerge that make this beast show its age , especially the so-called `` tactical '' light , some of which be smaller than a mini-mag , but brighter than the 6d . do not get I wrong . it be tough as nail and extraordinarily bright . but , the 3d cell maglite with the led upgrade put out a comparable amount of light , while consume only half the battery and be 40 % smaller . as of this writing -lrb- 7\/2007 -rrb- , there be no led upgrade bulb available from Maglite , save the 4d cell version , use with 2 dummy d-cell -lrb- why ? -rrb- third-party vendor have some good one , but they be either dimmer or do not focus . one even cost $ 75 + -lrb- for a $ 25 chassis -rrb- . one company boast its upgrade bulb will yield 140 lumen ; for comparison , the mag claim the 6d cell with the Xenon bulb yield 218 lumen . if Maglite be to put a lead upgrade for this light out on par with the 3d cell led upgrade , it would make this light incredibly bright and I would also give this the full five Stars . Bottom Line : if you must have a gi-normous flashlight that be well-engineered and virtually indestrctable , this be the one for you . I have one and love it , but truthfully , it be more of a novelty that satisfy some primal yearning inside of I . for emergency and everyday use , I have strategically located maglite 3d and min-mag , all lead , around the house . UPDATE : I get this 7\/17\/2007 from mag 's customer service about the 5-6 cell led upgrade : `` we do not plan on make a lead for the 5 or 6 cell light because the volume be too small to justify the tooling cost . led be voltage sensitive and if use in the wrong size light will either reduce the overall life of the lamp or blow it out . you can also purchase a battery spacer \/ dummy battery and use we 4 cell led module , model # sh34dcw6j .

Flashlight	POS	5	this be the greatest flashlight I have ever use . this have to be the brightest flashlight ever make .

Flashlight	POS	5	one day i fill up the sink and put my mag instrument 3d cell battery flashlight next to the sink go to use the washroom and when i get back it fall in the sink i take it out and to my surprise it still work
Flashlight	POS	5	this be the recommend bulb for the 36V Dewalt flashlight as well , I have have mine in there for about 6month with no issue .
Flashlight	POS	4	the name `` Maglite '' have always be , to I synonymous with quality -- I have be wear this one on my belt for several year now . it be small , light-weight and have a powerful light for something this small . the beam be quite bright for a flashlight this size , and the `` candle '' mode be a nifty feature -lrb- especially when the end of the flashlight fit into the upended top -rrb- . it help I more than once , especially when in a crowded elevator during a minor power outage . my parting comment to all who be in this elevator with I - `` why do not you have a flashlight with you ? '' my only gripe -- the nylon belt-sheath , which be durable -- not only allow the flashlight to fall out in some situation , but it do not keep the rotate head of the flashlight protect . more than once someone have come up to I to say `` Umm ... you belt be all light up !! '' I solve that problem by sew a -lrb- rip-stopped -rrb- strip of nylon onto the top of the sheath -lrb- back to front -rrb- , and attach velcro to the end of the strip and to the front of the sheath , so now my maglite stay securely in the sheath . would I buy aother Maglite ? sure ! I would like to eventually buy the whole family of Maglites -- from tiny to huge . they do the job and do it well .
Flashlight	POS	5	I buy this flashlight about 18 year ago . I be a police officer and have work many night . the flaslight have be bang around and drop numerous time . it be send back to maglight once after about 5 year of use for a defective switch . maglight fix it for free . I have to buy a new battery stick twice due to the battery lose its ability to charge . the new stick cost about $ 16 . a full charge usually last I a week of do midnight . now that I work day the charge last for month . the only down side be tha it be large and heavy , but I would not replace it for anything else . if you be look for a extremely bright and durable flashlight , this be it . I just want to add that after about 18 year of use the charger cradle stop work . I send it to Maglight and they fix it for free again . now that be the way to stand behind you product . I see alot of people rave about surefire flashlight and put maglight down . well I have be a police Officer in the Bronx for nearly 20 year now and use the same rechargeable maglight . it have be bang around and look it , but it still work like new . I pay about $ 100 18 year ago and now it sell for $ 85 . let see you $ 200 surefire after 18 year -lrb- I do not think so -rrb- .
Flashlight	POS	5	i love the feel of this . i keep this in my car and i feel safer in more way than one . ; - -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	if you be sick of constantly buy battery , and never have a flashlight handy , buy this gem . it be awesome , especially if you already have sink a few hundred into other dewalt product and wish you could use those battery for something else ! it be bright and take a beating !
Flashlight	NEG	2	essentially this add up to have a $ 60-ish workhorse powerhouse of a battery on the base , with a rather cheap flashlight attachment that be worth maybe $ 5 . I have have this light hang around for a couple of year from a combo set . it actually work well enough , though I do not often need a worklight . we recently have a 4 day power outage and this be great while it last both as a very bright flashlight , and to point at the ceiling to give some nice general non-glare room illumination . it only last about two hour on a charge be the problem . if anything scream out for a lead bulb , this be it , but at this point DeWalt do not even offer that as a separate bulb . they do sell a 12v lead worklight which sound just awesome , but I do not have the 12v system , I have the 18v . with a lead this would never burn out the bulb . this one will last maybe 10-15 hour which be not what you want in a emergency light with no spare . also if you drop this light the bulb filament will probably break , LED 's be much more robust . moreover , with the same brightness it would go probably 8-12 hour on a charge or more . that would be pretty much my essential emergency light . I would buy two or three . though the gooseneck probably look like the better design . what really kill this be that the head ought to swivel so it could point downward while stand upright on the battery base . you could work at a table or workbench with the light pointed at you work . but this only swivel from straight up to horizontal , which be really not all that useful . in short , wait for they to offer the gooseneck with a led , and get two , it will be super .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have one at work and I have one at home . I can always count on it work and use it all the time .
Flashlight	POS	5	I buy several of these as gift for the guy at work . they be a great small size flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	very bright little flashlight . nice little pouch with it fit almost anywhere but be as bright as a larger flash light . still use initial battery have have for 2 + month .
Flashlight	NEG	1	both my wife and my electrician manage to break a pair of these . unless you be really careful when set the light in place , they give away . it be the cheapest of plastic and do not take a beating .
Flashlight	POS	5	I order the light and it come in 3 day with regular shipping . the light be very bright , it be very lite for it be size and stay charge for day .
Flashlight	POS	4	I be take part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine , and everyone have two tool : a Mini Maglite and a  Leatherman  they all wear they on they belt , and they come in handy on numerous occasion . of course I pick one up and I love the little holster that come with it . if it do not look dorky I would probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time . it be not just good for night use . change a fuse , adjust equipment , find something under the desk . for those kind of everyday , all-the-time use , the Mini mag be much more handy and useful than the larger  maglite  highly recommend for its simplicity , utility , and durability .
Flashlight	POS	4	I purchase a couple of these set . I have a hard time find my flashlight when the electricity go out . so , I purchase these and now I have designate place for my maglite flashlight . Safety wise , it be a good thing too . I do not like that you have to put so much pressure on the flashlight in order for it to lock in place . be careful with you finger . I get the feeling these bracket may break if you put to much pressure on they .
Flashlight	POS	5	it have the expect Maglite quality . I give this product five star . my wife be very happy with it and with the service provide by the vendor , whatever its name be .
Flashlight	POS	5	I think that this be the fourth AA Maglite that I have purchase . the oldest one be still work and date back to 1990 . these be very dependable flashlight !
Flashlight	NEG	2	Thats how this work . you rotate the top portion around and the brightness and focal length increase . but then it come off at the end . I read this about this product before , but its kind of annoy when you want to use this in a hurry and it become loose . would have prefer a switch . its quite compact and slip easily into you pocket . would buy again from Maglite , but not the same design . Advice : look for something else , but make sure it doesnt operate the same way as this device .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a excellent light . it be quite bright , well-constructed , and rest easily on the shoulder when hold in the hand . it be a unparalleled $ 25 when I buy it , and absolutely worth that pittance . I wrap around it a good length of duct tape and electrical tape , and thus make it a dispenser of each . I carry it in my car at all time .
Flashlight	POS	5	I need a small flashlight for work and have go through many , many aa size flashlight . I just notice these 2aa lead maglite in the store and decide to try one out . I be not sure how bright it would be because besides the 3 watt label , mag do not really state the brightness of the light . when I get home I be pleasantly surprise . this light be at least 5 time brighter than a regular 2aa maglite and it be also brighter than any other -lrb- include lead -rrb- flashlight I have use . and what matter more , compare to the regular bulb maglite , the beam on the LED light focus perfectly to a even circle . no more dark area . the one thing I miss be the little hole in the endcap which can be use for lanyard or keyring . also the lead version be a tad bit longer than the bulb version , but for the huge performance gain , I 'll gladly have a slightly larger flashlight . I can not comment on the battery usage yet , as I have not have to change battery yet , a good sign ... and I be so glad that I do not have to worry about the little bulb burn out every so often anymore . I can highly recommend this light , it be well worth the money if you need a good flashlight . I do wish that the other color be available as show on mag 's website . Amazon or any other local store just seem to have the black version .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a nice , sturdy , flashlight in a metal casing . it have a nice bright beam and fit easily into a drawer . it be a definite improvement over the cheap plastic flashlight that I have . Amazon have it at a good price . I recommend .
Flashlight	POS	4	all man like flashlight , perhaps its a carryover from we day as caveman when we always make sure we have fire available . the mag be the equivalent of a muscle car . sure there be smaller , faster and even cheaper flashlight but the mag just work . its totally no-nonsense and have the product recognition value equivalent to Apple Computer . the drawback be many . its big , heavy , the krypton light be not the best and the adjustable beam be rather ragged look but it put out a good amount of light and be tough enough to be drop , use as a self defense weapon , improvise hammer , dog repellent , or crowbar . you can get a xenon bulb for greater light output at the expense of battery life , or a lead upgrade which drop right in . many police force stop use the mag not because it be a bad flashlight but because they be beat suspect to death with they so they be force to use cr123 base minus tactical light . that one tough flashlight . they be not overly expensive , as there be other out there cost 4-5 time as much and frankly I be unsure why they charge such a premium . they be make in the USA so they can be consider a reasonably patriotic purchase .
Flashlight	NEG	1	light wont stay on . after filing and sand all contact area it improve a little . I still have to bang it to stay on . very disapointed . flashlight from a dollar store be better .
Flashlight	NEU	3	I have have several of these for many year . good for find a keyhole . have now discover the 3 aa lead mag . major improvement , a REAL light up the night instrument ! for twice the cost , it be 5 time the light . pass on the 2 aa , move up to the 3 aa lead !
Flashlight	POS	5	the Sheriffs deputy in we police department carry the `` magcharger '' system flashlight for decade , and the reason be very clear : this be one of the most powerful semi-compact flashlight on the market . there be a lot of great flashlight out there , and the latest led light be awesome for light output , longevity , and burn time , but you really can not mess with perfection . I have have the chance to use the rx1019 for a long time because a family member be a cop and carry one . my first impression be holy cow ! I have see some really bright light , the 9 volt search and rescue spot light , 5 + watt lead light from Surefire , Pelican , etc. , but the mag be as bright , if not brighter , and cost $ 100 less than the Surefire . this be not a led-type lamp light system . it use a high-pressure halogen bulb fill with xenon and krypton gas . it be similar to the one in you car . Streamlight 's Stinger -lrb- also a awesome light , which I own -rrb- series use they as well to great effect . the difference between the halogen and lead lamp be that the led do not use a filament to generate light , so they last longer , run considerably cooler , and use less energy -lrb- more efficient -rrb- . they also produce light that be closer on the Kelvin scale to daylight , so it be much purer , whiter light , which provide better visibility at night . they can be very powerful , but they just do not produce the same effect as a halogen bulb , and lead technology be still be perfect . in the box , you get the flashlight , charge cradle , battery , car adapter , ac adaptor , and two mount plate for mount the charge cradle to a wall or other surface . the Nicad battery be not a `` sub-c '' type , but have cell similar in size to c-cell battery for increase run time . in fact , mag claim 2-hour run time , and I can substantiate that . it do take a while to charge it though . I really like the Magcharger . it be not `` small '' at over 12 inch long and 1-1\/2 inch thick , or lightweight either -lrb- that big battery stick be heavy , but without it , the light be really lightweight -rrb- . it weigh 2 or so pound , which be not really a detriment . every mating surface -lrb- tail cap , lens bezel , focus head -rrb- , include the switch , be rubber seal for water resistance . it be get a temper glass lens that be really tough and unlikely to break . you get a spare bulb in the tail cap , and change the bulb be simple : unscrew the lens bezel , take out the lens , and pull out the bulb . plus , it be beautiful . it be construct of aircraft aluminum that be be machine from a billet , and it be make entirely of aluminum , then anodize with gloss black inside and out for maximum corrosion resistance in marine and other harsh environment -lrb- think Iraq , the desert -rrb- . the body be knurl for a good grip , and the charge contact be actually a polished aluminum ring that encircle the front of the light behind the switch . the weight and heft of the light be actually beneficial because you can use it as a weapon if you have to . cop know this , and this be why they carry the mag . it be a effective weapon as well . Cold hard aluminum can do serious damage . this toughness also mean it be well-protected from abuse . I have hear story of these be run over , drop off building , fall out of the back of a pickup on the highway , and submerge for day and they still work -lrb- bulb might need change -rrb- . now for the flashlight part of the mag . to say it be bright be a understatement . this thing be really bright . Maglite say you can get 40,000 candle power , which be a lot . it throw a bright shaft of light over 250 foot in spot mode . focus it to flood and you can illuminate a very large area . the focus action be very solid , with no noticable play or eccentrcity . up close , the beam be positively blind . this be much brighter than my Streamlight Stinger , which be already very bright . the beam be very powerful . if you be to shine someone in the eye with this , it would be debilitating and disorienting , which be good if you be a cop enter a house with possible suspect inside , or in a home defense situation . it be almost like this be make for law enforcement ! the only gripe I can think of revolve around the nature of the beast . the lens area get really hot during extend operation and can burn you if you come into contact with it . also , the Nicad battery stick only last about a year of constant charge\/discharge cycle , and replace it be expensive . plus , maybe a minor gripe , you can not use it in a HazMat environment . so ... pro : Super bright can be use as a defensive weapon adjustible beam high quality construction solidly build water resistant good run time rechargable will outlast you Cons : Lens get very hot battery pack do not last very long can not use it in HazMat environment I really like the Magcharger . it do everything you want it to very well , and even do a little more . it be beautiful , reliable , durable , and a high quality instrument that will last you for year and year . if you be look for a new light , but do not want a led , or want something bigger than the Stinger , check out the rx1019 .
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be awesome . it be just about 2 foot long . it could easily be use defensively since it look like a baseball bat flashlight . it put out 160 luke which be great for this more natural look light . great buy and very happy .
Flashlight	POS	4	Mine be order with lead bulb , which extend battery life a lot . that be useful in case there be need to search for someone lose . c-battery do not make it excessively heavy , though so far have not have to carry mine for hour . I get the idea from a magazine article by Massad Ayoob .
Flashlight	POS	4	I be seek a AA Maglite flashlight and notice the `` lead upgrade '' offerer by a number of vendor . I find this flashlight and decide to buy it because it be the genuine maglite brand and feature the lead bulb . the lamp be much brighter and the light be much whiter without the dark spot typical of the standard maglite bulb . what be disappointing be that its larger than the standard size aa maglite , and the larger size feel strange in the hand . I wind up buy the standard aa maglite and the nite-ize led upgrade .
Flashlight	POS	5	what more can I say - it ' a a MagLite & it work in Sub-Zero Deg f - -rrb- `` no surprise '' . a few suggestion for the unknow on the use of the mode : full power : for distance work - full saturation 25 % power : use during reading ; close work not blind by surface reflection ; extend usage Strobe : Beacon for warn or attention when use color lens -lrb- optional -rrb- ; search & rescue locator SOS : Beacon for search & rescue locator finally , later model tail cap permit a lanyard to be attach . why MagLite put out the earlier led model with the `` FLAT Tail Cap '' be beyond I .
Flashlight	POS	5	unless you want to spend hundred on a flashlight -lrb- see streamlight-primarily use by fireman -rrb- you can not find a better unit than a maglite . I have AAA , AA , C and D cell maglte flashlight . both my wife and I feel that the c cell size be easier to hold than the d cell model . I really prefer the 3 c cell model-i find the length just right , though the 2 cell model fit in car better . make in the USA . and can be easily upgrade to a lead ` bulb ' . a little bonus : if you live in hurricane territory , when the store run out of d cell battery , there be always c cell battery on the shelf , mean you can get battery when other can not .
Flashlight	POS	5	we have own a few cheap-o led minus flashlight , but think it would be smart to have a higher quality item with we camping tool , so I purchase this one . this mini maglite led be perfect ! it out-shine we other 3 lead light , have a focus option for the beam -lrb- very helpful ! -rrb- , a all-metal housing , and the quality feel you get with all maglite product . I be so please with this light , I be order a couple more to replace the one we keep in we glovebox .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I can not believe they still make this . I have have my aa maglight since 8th grade . I have replace the bulb about 10 time back in the day . as soon as led light come out - I upgrade , and NEVER look back . Modern lead light be way bright , much more durable , and many of they much smaller . Cheapo Fenix single AAA be build better than this , be much smaller , and MUCH BRIGHTER . I just can imagine a single instance when I would recommend this .
Flashlight	NEU	3	always know where you flashlight be with these handy clip . Works on most `` d '' cell flashlight in either the horizontal or vertical position . one clip be sufficient for a 2-cell flashlight . I keep one one the wall by the garage door so I always know where the flashlight be . it would work equally well in a car , truck , boat , or camper . I be think about mount one on my bike handlebars : -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	when three tornado hit my board school , I come to realize the importance of a flashlight -lrb- which I didnt have at the time , unfortunately -rrb- . realize my error in not own such a essential item , I immediately go to the store and buy one . my family have own -lrb- and lose -rrb- numerous flashlight , and we mag lite be by far the best flashlight we have ever own . some flashlight go on and off as the battery jiggle around , die as soon as you drop they , or just be not make to live long . mag lite be definitely not these flashlight ! my minus Maglite have be drop , kick , stomp , squish , throw , everything ... and it still work great ! it be three year old now and still work like it do on day one . it do not suck battery dry , which be definitely a plus , and the light be constant . it do not flicker on and off if teh battery somehow shake . I love how you can change the beam to cover a large area or focus in on a small area . it be great for late night read in the dorm room . now I even own a small MagLite Solitaire for my keychain . it be very small but just as powerful . altogether , a great little flashlight and a excellent price .
Flashlight	POS	5	a well know , try and true product with enormous light output and long battery life . we own many .
Flashlight	NEU	3	this flashlight be ok in most situation , but only put out 2 lumen of light . I suggest get a flashlight that have more lumen .
Flashlight	POS	4	the Mag Charger , as all maglite , be a american icon -- we all love they and love use mag 's ! although there be many product on the market which be superior -lrb- as with the Harley-Davidson -rrb- I still like my MagLite more than other . I have upgrade this mag charger with the excellent terralux -lrb- of USA -rrb- tle-300mr which be a 600 luman lead upgrade . WOW ! the basic product be still great and have the shape , fit and finish we be all use to -lrb- and be make in USA like TerraLUX -rrb- while the performance be unsurpassed ! way to go .
Flashlight	NEG	2	these be decent light for navigate the wood in the dark , but if you do ... get two of they . they like to cut out often , require a sharp rap to get work again ... then they work just fine for a bit ... and repeat the entire scenario all over again . it be as though the contact be inferior and unable to provide a constant load to the led bulb . why do they send more of those stupid nylon sheath ? I have to have at least twenty of they now over the year , and have yet to actually find any use for any of they . on a positive note , they be plenty bright , and the battery last quite a while , if they would just always work as they should , they would be great ... but they just plain do not ... not at all dependable .
Flashlight	POS	5	to start , I be a tradesman who have to carry he lifeline on he belt . not only on the job , but I be also the unnofficial handyman of this apartment complex . every time I even move to take my workbelt off , it seem to be a signal for a neighbor to bang on the wall say something be on fire or will not open all the way . and the Mini mag be the universal flashlight . it be sell everywhere , include this fine site and even family store , and despite its legendary quality and design , be at the most ten dollar with include holster . I prefer the classic aa design , where CA not you find aa ? I have use one of these on my belt for about four year . it be a excellent tool , and I have never have one wear out on I . the bulb , however , be the Achilles heel . the rest of the flashlight be military , police and trade quality , for civilian price . but these dang bulb go orange after a couple week and last a couple month of casual use . I be consider shell out forty buck for a small led , just to save the money on bulb . then , walk through a sport outlet , I pass the flashlight section . and next to the usual Mini mag with holster , which I own close to six of , be a Nite ize accessory design for this same flashlight . a lead bulb . now , I have see these online for about twenty to thirty buck , and this be a ten dollar flashlight ! but this one just sit around on a shelf be eight buck , about a buck less than the flashlight 's shelf price . what the heck , I get one . to quote another review , my trusty old mag be now a state-of-the-art torch , with nearly triple battery life of the old bulb . and led , as all mag-hater know , do not burn out or even go out when bump . so , for a total of twenty buck , you get a american-quality led beam that compete and plain out whip fifty-dollar import with plastic casing . I would not recomend this flashlight if there be not there be a way to fix its biggest flaw . just get you hand on this led adapter , and put it in like you would the standard bulb . replace the mirror reflector , and stomp the old bulb into powder . you will not be need they , ever again . there be also a combo pack availiable , for the same price , that include a push-button adapter if you have ever wish you could tap a red button on the end instead of twist it on and off . I have not try it , but it come with the LED , and for eight buck ? and hey , the flashlight itself come in six different color . these thing be easily replace if one get bang up or you room-mate\/girlfriend draw all over it with sharpie while she be on the phone . I have have these work perfectly even they have be through Hades and back , but some prefer a more formal-looking flashlight . just take the lead out and put it in the new one , those bulb last forever . and now , so will this flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be simply the best flash light I have ever use . really like the light focus feature and solid feel .
Flashlight	POS	5	not much need to be say , a fantastic light that have serve I for year . it just get to be time to replace a very old one . I stand by the traditional bulb for the same reason I recommend the 3 cell over the 2 cell , they be better if you need to crack somebody in the skull .
Flashlight	POS	5	maglite s2c016 black c cell flashlight , 2-c  awesome !!
Flashlight	POS	5	this very portable flashlight be heavy and sturdy . it have be drop several time , with no damage to the glass . the illumination be also quite strong for the size of the flashlight , and will last for several week of use without a battery change . this be easily the most durable flashlight of its kind ; you be likely to lose it before you damage it .
Flashlight	NEG	2	wow . never buy another torch again ! portable light , without heat . this thing be _ AMAZING _ . beware , it do eat battery . also , do not look directly into the fire , as it may temporarily blind you ! mag be back with another winner here !
Flashlight	POS	5	for Makita owner , I can confirm that this bulb do work in the Makita 18V flashlight , and it seem just as bright as the original Makita bulb .
Flashlight	POS	5	Maglite flashlight be renown for they top-notch quality , they waterproof \/ water resistant design , and they extremely durable and corrosion-resistant aircraft grade aluminum casing . the Maglite AA Mini Flashlight -lrb- model : m2a01h -rrb- be no exception . pro -- - come with a Holster the holster have a loop for thread a belt through . it be well-stitched and make of durable nylon . - waterproof \/ water resistant the maglite be immersible in a few foot of water . - durable the aircraft grade aluminum make the casing of the Maglite extremely durable and completely corrosion resistant . - small and portable the maglite be handy for emergency , hike , camping and other use - and its small size make it very portable for take it along anywhere you go so you would not be catch without a flashlight when you need one ! - well-crafted and beautiful con -- - Painted Exterior The black paint of the exterior be extremely durable but it can get inadvertantly scratch off . if that be a concern , I would recommend the silver maglite , which have a bare , unpainted aluminum surface . - incandescent flashlight bulb the incandescent flashlight bulb that come with the Maglite can blow out , especially when subject to extreme temperature . LED Flashlight Bulb Replacement ------------------------------- the  terralux lead flashlight bulb  lead light bulb be brighter , use less energy , and have a 30,000 hour lifespan . conclusion ---------- the Maglite Mini Flashlight be waterproof \/ water resistant , portable , and have a extremely durable exterior . if use with a lead flashlight bulb , the Maglite Mini Flashlight be a extremely bright and reliable light source that consume very little battery power . it just do not get any better than this !
Flashlight	POS	5	this be the best , most usable flashlight I have ever use . get a bright color or silver so you can find it in the DARK . significant advantage over cheap throw-away light : - aluminum construction make it durable and beautiful . - great size for the hand - relatively light weight -lrb- but heavier than cheap plastic light ! -rrb- - Extra bulb hold within the flashlight ! - take two common aa battery - candle function . neat ! - focusable beam change from wide to narrow and bright . - come with a durable cloth holster . this be my flashlight of choice for around the house , toolbox , camping , and emergency kit . it be tough , reliable , and look pretty nice too . I do not recommend the camo design - it can be easy to lose if you drop it outside !
Flashlight	POS	4	I have a maglite on my keychain . I forget how old it be , but almost all the black paint be rub off leave bare metal . it still work on the original led . sometimes the twist-switch get gunk up , and need cleaning , but it mostly still work like new . I can not think of any design improvement .
Flashlight	POS	4	I buy this for my 18V B&D; flashlight . it fit a little looser than the orginal and I be a little worried that it would not work , but it work just fine . I have not use it long enough to comment on bulb life .
Flashlight	POS	5	I get one of these issue at work today because I could not find my normal use flashlight . I throw out the box immediately so I have to look up the multus mode feature online to clarify why the light be do what it be do . I really like these feature though . the 25 % brightness feature will help if you want to use the light in candle mode as the bare led be super bright and not suitable for light a table if the power go out . less bright equal more comfort in those situation . I can see myself use the flash feature as well . you could leave the light outside flash as a signal if someone be go to you house and could not find it , for instance . the SOS feature be a neat thing , I suppose , but I hope I never have to use it ! I have a mini mag aa at home with a lead conversion , but this one be much brighter . same mag quality you expect from they other stuff . if I have to buy this light , I certainly would . I be glad work give I one for free -lrb- go toolroom guy ! -rrb- but I want to recommend this product in case anyone be on the fence about it .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have this flashlight for literally over 25 year and it be go strong . I get it as a boy scout for campout when I be about 15 . it be not buy on Amazon since they do not exist back then ! it have survive many a camping trip and now that I be a dad myself come in handy around the house . always a great accessory to bring with you to check out those `` bump in the night '' - this bad boy double as a formidable club . I remember check out the different size from 3 to 6 cell and the 4 cell have -lrb- for I -rrb- just the right balance between weight and light output . I like it so much I just order a lead upgrade which be no longer manufacture by mag and cost about the same as a new light since it be in demand . financially not the smartest thing I have do but I want to keep this one go . sentimentality and loyalty to a flashlight ? only to a maglite !
Flashlight	POS	4	I sure do like this light . light be bright , and last a pretty good long time . the only thing that I do not like about it be that if you set it down on the battery , and raise the lamp up and point it down , it become unbalanced . but ... that do not hinder my use it ... love the light .
Flashlight	POS	5	Maglite be a little late get into the lead market , but this little light be a good value and the same maglite quality .
Flashlight	NEG	2	I be very excite to get this light ... initially , I like it . out of the packaging , I hook it up to the 18v battery and it work , emit a fairly bright beam . the sale ad say that it come with a `` extra '' bulb , which be not include . I email Amazon regard the issue and they send a 2nd light to my address , instead of send a bulb or two -lrb- ? -rrb- . it be worth mention the the re-ship do not have the extra bulb either . I have pretty much decide to just purchase the other light as well , think I could use one and leave one in the work truck as a spare . then , I be use one of the light , hit it pretty hard with a board I be use in a attic , and it fizzle . I go and get the other light , use it the rest of the morning , then go to use it in the afternoon and it be burn out too - with little to no abuse -lrb- that I can remember -rrb- . I send both of the light back - they be not as durable as they should be . instead , I order two of the flexible-head light -lrb- Dewalt 18V -rrb- . a few of my friend have these and have have no issue . I will leave a review for those as well when I have have time to put they to the test . all in all , this be a bright light , but if you put you equipment to the test day-in and day-out , it might not be the quality you be look for .
Flashlight	POS	5	Got this at Wally World for a little more than Amazon -lrb- last minute buy -rrb- for a camping trip . boy be I glad I buy this ! half we group be separate from we during the trip to the camp site and it be late . luckily I be the only person in we party that have any light for the first night and I use this to collect wood for a fire and get a fire go . ton of use for two battery and extremely bright and powerful for it be size .
Flashlight	POS	5	my company buy one of these Mag Lights and I didnt expect much from a rechargeable light . wow be I wrong , this light be better than any dry cell flashlight ever make . this be more like a spotlight on a police car with 50,000 candle power . we use this light all the time in a industrial enviroment where it get greasy a lot , and this have lead it to be drop a time or two , none the less it have never fail to operate like new . . the rechargeable feature on this light be so handy . we just hang up the light at the end of the day in its cradle and it be ready for hard action the next day ...
Flashlight	POS	5	this little flashlight have be a great help in many situation . I keep one in my purse and one in the kitchen drawer with the dog 's leash and drop it into my pocket before take my dog for walk at night . it not only light my way , but help I find the dropping as well as the key hole when I get back to my condo . the candle mode have come in handy during several blackout .
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be amazing ! you can use it for anything , and it will not break . my Dad have a old empty de-icer can in he truck , and it be make really obnoccious noise , and annoy I . so , I cave it in with my maglite . I have drop it countless time , and it be still fine . it can light up the house in the backlot behind we house , about 250 yard away . there be a squirrel that come into we house through the chimney , and wasrunn around we house in the day , when we be not there , and hide on the fridge when we be home . so , my mom see the cat sniff around the fruidge , and ask I to take a look . so , with my maglite , I look around , and there he be , the peice of vermin , sit on we fridge . my brother get a stick , and I be the light man . my brother finally get he out , and after 5 or 10 minute of chase the stupid thing , shine the light in he eye , he run out the back door . the flashlight play a big part in get the stupid peice of vermon out . after that , and after my sister handle it with filthy hand , it smell , so I wash it under run water in the bathroom sink , twice so it would stop smell bad , and it be still fine . it be definately handy if you be move , and you have a big messy garage , or to light up anything dark . if there be a power outage , the lamp mode be a big help . during previous power outage , my Dad 's tryed settind up flashlight all over the place , and it do not work . if you need a good flashlight , buy a 4 cell maglite . it be big enough to be very bright , but , unlike a 6 cell , it be small enough so that you do not a crane to move it anywhere .
Flashlight	POS	4	before decide to post this review , I decide to look over the review that be already post . I notice that many reviewer complain about low-intensity light and the relatively short battery life . well , I can see where they be come from . if you want a flashlight to use day in and day out , on every night you go camping , or to frequently navigate through a dark house , then this be definitely \* not \* the flashlight for you . why do I like it so much ? let I tell you about where and how I use it , and you 'll understand . I have be camp since I be a kid . back when I start , those giant flashlight that run on those blocky 12-volt battery be common . I have a few of those . I also have plenty of those plastic flashlight that run on d-battery -lrb- now those be true battery hog -rrb- . in time , I learn about MagLites , and begin use various model . for a number of year , I think I have settle on the 2 aa Mini model . it certainly be a great flashlight , but I find I need a flashlight less and less . as that happen , I start look for a small light I could carry `` just in case '' -- and the MagLite Solitaire fit the bill . I have be carry one for year now . you see , when I first start camping , or even if the light go out at home , I feel I need a bright , powerful flashlight . over the year I have learn , however , that such bright light serve mainly to reset you night vision . only on the most overcast and moonless night do I ever find myself really need a flashlight -- or when someone drop they car key in the back yard at the end of a long night around the fire . even when in my tent , I find that have a smaller light work out really well . it I need it on , it be bright enough to let I see , but not so bright as to disturb my tentmate . in addition , its light weight and small size make it a ideal backcountry companion . it take up alomst no room in my pocket , and hang comfortably from a piece of paracord around my neck . like its larger cousin , the Solitaire let you adjust the beam , from a tight focus to a broader diffusion . as some have note , however , the low light output -lrb- 2 lumen -rrb- be such that many may not preceive much benefit . I do find the adjustment useful , however , use the broadest diffusion when use the light for general illumination in a small space or dark area , and focus the beam when I be really try to look at something in particular . also like its larger cousin , the Solitaire will operate with the lens end remove in what be call `` candle mode '' . use that way , you could place the solitaire on a flat surface and use it like you would a candle . here 's where it really do fail compare to its larger cousin , however . on those model , the lens end be larger than the diameter of the shaft\/handle , allow the lens end to be slipped onto the bottom like a base , give the candle-mode flashlight a wider base when stand it up . since the Solitairs be the same diameter along its entire length , that be not a option . when I use it in candle mode , it be typically to quickly illuminate most of the tent , and I just keep the lens end in my off hand . the solitair be small enough that I can tuck it in between my hat and my temple , too , free both of my hand when necessary -lrb- like when try to fix my glass -rrb- . - I keep one in my tackle box , as a convenient light when need to search for some bit of tackle at dusk or after nightfall . - when camping , with the help of a little clip or piece of string , you can hang the light from a gear loft or a clip in you tent , give you a quick and easy way to light a central area -lrb- to play card , for example -rrb- . - I keep one on my key ring when I travel , just in case I need a little light to check something under the hood . - when hike , I always carry one with I `` just in case '' , even if I start out during the day time . while some decry how dim the light be , you would be amaze by how easy it be to spot even the smallest light during the dark of night . besides , but this little light up against a clear -lrb- or light color -rrb- plastic water bottle will illuminate all the water in the bottle , allow you to create a more visible object if you need to get someone 's attention . - I never use the light for more than a few minute at a time , so I have never have a complaint about the battery life . in fact , I be very happy with the battery life , and the fact that I can keep the same battery in the light for month on end without it drain down to nothing . while it be always best to take the battery out when not use it for a long time , I have have they sit in the Solitaire for a full year and still kick out light when I need it . - they make great gift . my wife and three of my kid each have one , and they all find they useful . a MagLite Solitarie be a great tool to put on a new driver 's key ring . -lrb- even better be to pair it with a Victorinox Classic Swiss Army Knife ! -rrb- - keep one in the glove box -- the small size make it really easy to handle if you need to poke around under the dashboard to replace a fuse . - put one in a mini survival kit . it be small enough to fit into many mint tin alongside other survival gear -lrb- e.g. , hook , line , match , razor -rrb- . as note before , a small light in the dark can often be see from far away . besides , in a survival situation , that light can be use to attract fish by dangle it in the water ...
Flashlight	POS	5	you can never find a bulb for the sear craftsman flash light . it blow they out if you bump the flashlight . waste time !!! spend a little $ get the DEWALT I have 3 -lrb- SEARS be way to much $ -rrb- Amazon have best price for bulb too ! 18 volt .
Flashlight	POS	5	I install these in the ` saddlebag ' of my Chevy Avalanche and they work very well . I actually use some special fastener from Lowes to use as I be install these in plastic . they have a very firm grip on the flashlight and it look like these will last a long time .
Flashlight	POS	5	these mag light bracket work great I mount it on the wall now I can always find my mag light no more look for it only need to use one bracket . there make of plastic not sure how long they will last but for the money there be worth it . there be not much more I can say about they ship and receive on time would buy again .
Flashlight	POS	5	no matter what size flashlight you prefer to carry or keep in you home\/car , buy a maglite . they come in all size , and for a few dollar more , you be get a flashlight that will survive anything and work when you need it . Trust I , you will make you money back in the long run . I only feel cheated because all of my maglite will outlast my lifetime . I be go to have to leave they to someone in my will .
Flashlight	POS	5	let 's get real : you will not find any better 100 % american flashlight for this price . consider the excellent quality of this product do it make sense to buy any other flashlight ? absolutely no ! some critic say batteri will not last . ok , that be true but you can buy 4 nimh battery and good charger for less than 25 buck and get hour and hour of light with this tiny marvel . lead flashlight have be around for some time but they cost 3-4 time a mag and -lrb- read it -rrb- the be not as bright with a pair of aa cell . besides most led be cheaply make in China . mag Lite still rock . any replacement for this american beauty will only come from MAG Lite Company .
Flashlight	NEU	3	the dw904 can be a excellent accessory to have , but I much prefer the Dewalt flexible model to the pivot type flashlight because they really handle daily on the job abuse better and also have the add advantage of a long rubber cover flexible neck to wrap around object for better positioning . my preference be base on heavy use of both type of the 12v , 14.4 v and 18v model . most of the flexible model I currently own be several year old and have have many time more use than the pivot model ever will , for a good reason . although they have be pretty well beat up , all be still work fine and I could never say enough good thing about they . the on-off switch on all model be fairly well protected but can occasionally get stick in one position because of heavy dirt or mud buildup . the switch can be free up easily with the aid of a stiff part clean brush once the mud have dry . if you do a lot of work in crawl space or other area where dirt , mud , sand and grit can get ground into the pivot joint of the dw904 flashlight , it can eventually cause excessive wear at the joint and damage to the spring loaded electrical contact located there , cause the light to malfunction without warn at a most inopportune time . one day , I have just such a experience use the 12v dw904 while replace the motor on a circulator pump located about sixty foot back inside a crawl space under a hotel . the crawl space have absolutely no area lighting of its own and none of the natural light that you sometimes get through vent , so the dw904 be literally the only source of light to be have . about halfway into the job , I be in the process of adjust the flashlight head to better light the work area , when everything suddenly go pitch black . at first , I think , ... okay ... , maybe the bulb have just burn out . I would have to change the bulb in the dark once before so I new it could be do . feel my way around the flashlight , I carefully unscrew the lens and replace the bulb with a spare bulb store inside the flashlight head . the bulb be not the problem . I remember think , ... `` Heeere Lassie ! '' ... because there be no way I be go to be able to navigate my way around obstacle and get out of the crawl space without see where I be go . fortunately , I have a two-way radio with I and be able to get hold of someone up above to grab another flashlight and come down to where I be work . I do not think this situation be bring about by any flaw or defect in the dw904 so much as that it be just not design for any type of use that expose it be pivot joint to continuous abrasion from sand and dirt . the older Makita 9.6 v pivot type flashlight I use year ago where also susceptible to the same problem , although none of they ever go completely and totally dead on I like the Dewalt do . you could usually bang the Makita against a floor joist a few time and it would come back to life , at least temporarily . overall , if you plan to use you flashlight only in clean , dry location , the dw904 should be a good choice . on the other hand , if you plan to consistently use you flashlight in damp , dirty environment and other high abuse area , as most tradesman normally will , then one of Dewalt 's flexible flashlight model be definitely a better and much more appropriate choice .
Flashlight	POS	4	there be not much i can say about a maglite that hasnt already be say its solid , durable , with excellent finish -lrb- the silver in my book be worth the lil extra that be my personal -rrb- . I purchase a lead replacement ` bulb ' that alone say I plan to have this for life .
Flashlight	POS	4	this little light be bright but right in the center seem to be a dark area ? it lose a star for the dark center , you would think the center would be the brightest but it be not .
Flashlight	POS	5	maglite have the best quality there be ! get it quickly and it be package well . price be unbeatable -lrb- i check -rrb- very happy with this product !
Flashlight	POS	5	machine from solid rigid aluminum , this be a small well design and well make metal flashlight that deliver a strong white light for only $ 11.75 . it take two aa battery by unscrew the end cap which have a rubber o ring to keep out water . it fit easily in you hand and turn on by twist the end with the light so it can no accidentally go on like some other light with switch or button . it be not a fancy ultra lead light like some more expensive one on the market and those have they place in you house , but with this one you get rugged , reliable bright light for just a few buck so you can afford to buy several and keep they in different place in you house or car for handy use .
Flashlight	POS	5	I be a maglite repeat customer , so I guess I have already know I would like this aaa version . I buy one to try , but i will be buy more to keep at various place around the house so that whenever I need to look behind or under something I have a light handy . they be tough , durable , bright and , because of they size , incredible convenient . mag have another win flashlight model here . I especially like the candle function .
Flashlight	POS	4	when you be buy a replacement bulb for you Ryobi lignt , buy high quality ... dewalt or eq . I have the factory bulb in my heavily used light for 5 year , then it break . the first replacement I buy -lrb- the cheap one -rrb- last a month before it break . I suspect these will go longer .
Flashlight	POS	5	experience coping with blackout lead I to experiment with lot of battery light -- fluorescent , lead , and conventional incandescent bulb . this 6 d-cell light provide the largest area and brightest illumination . here 's how I use it : I set it vertically so its beam bounce off white ceiling . I also use some handy household object as a base holder to keep it from tip . in the kitchen it provide enough light -lrb- while aim at the white ceiling -rrb- to prepare a simple meal use the gas stove -- and for wash dish afterward . later , in a 20 ' x 30 ' live room , it provide enough light bounce off the ceiling so that everyone could sit , talk , eat dinner , and see everyone else in the room . that be comforting & reassuring ! finally , in the bathroom & bedroom , this very bright light , aim at the white ceiling , provide enough illumination for showering and brushing tooth as well as allow two person to move around a bedroom without bump , stumble , or stub toe .
Flashlight	POS	4	the amount of illumination this small light provide compare favorably with that from a double-d-cell flashlight use a krypton bulb , which be probably what most folk expect from a general-purpose light . that say , compare one to another be tricky because of difference in the beam . a standard flashlight project a strong center spot surround by a broad halo of rather dim and often uneven light . however , with its much smaller reflector and led , the Mini-Maglite produce a strong center spot with a halo that be both much narrower and considerably brighter than its counterpart . therefore , one of the way I compare the two light source be to aim each at the white ceiling of a darkened room while observe the amount of reflect illumination of the furnishings . unlike the yellowish light emit by incandescent bulb , the LED in the Mini-Maglite provide a brilliant , white light that seem to be quite close to daylight in color temperature . it do not suffer from the distinct bluish tint common to many high-brightness led . the light output from this led light be much greater than that of the incandescent version of the Mini-Mag , which I also have . I measure initial current drain from a set of fresh aa battery at around 500ma , compare to somewhat over 300mA in the regular Mini-Mag . the company claim the light use a 3-watt led -lrb- as rate by supplier -rrb- , but it would appear that even with a new set of alkaline battery the actual energy use will not exceed half that rating . Furthur , my measurement indicate the power will likely decline by half again once the battery have start to become weak . of course , one can not expect miracle from two small battery and the reduction be likely a balance between high output and power usage . I would expect several hour of strong light , with slowly diminish output until the battery be exhaust . like the regular version , this mini-maglite be operate by unscrew the head slightly to activate a internal switch . furthur rotation will focus the beam somewhat as the reflector move outward . there be not a great deal of difference in the lead version , and very much twist simply reduce the overall light output . the head may actually be remove and use as a base to support the light in candle mode . this be make possible by the elimination of a lanyard like be attach to the tail cap of the standard Mini-Mag . as owner of several multi-led flashlight , I have learn that one big advantage to have a single led be the narrow , project beam it provide . that feature come in handy when you be walk at night and want to see some distance ahead . the light in the sp2201h package come with a holster for carry the flashlight lens-up on a belt or perhaps hang it from a nail . two Duracell battery be also include . I have read that other folk have encounter problem with the switch be intermittant , and I must admit that the flashlight do not work well with another brand of battery I install during testing . mostly make in the USA , the flashlight carry a limited lifetime warranty that exclude burnout of the led module . improper installation of the battery may destroy this item , so be very careful . if have a slender light that weigh less than a third of the typical flashlight , yet illuminate just as well appeal to you , then I think you 'll be please with the Mini-Maglite LED .
Flashlight	POS	5	my old black Mini mag lite finally die , so I be look to replace it . this -lrb- cheapest -rrb- version of the Mini mag be shiney silver , which I be now get use to after have the black one . it come with 2 Dura cell battery , a spare bulb , and a black weave nylon holster . there be a hole drill through the end cap to allow you to put a cord on it and\/or hang it on a nail , I guess . while it do not focus into a perfectly round smooth beam , it be round and smooth enough for general use . you can spread out the beam if desire , or even remove the head and use it as a holder for the `` candle mode '' - just the handle point up with the bare bulb on top - to , say , illuminate you whole tent for a minute . no doubt you can put a $ 15 conversion bulb in this $ 10 flashlight and make it a $ 25 flashlight , but why bother ? the only minor complaint I can find be the holster can not just slip onto you belt - you must thread you belt throught the flat loop . this could be a good thing as well , though . I buy two .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have mag light over the year and far as I can tell I will continue to buy they . I work as a handyman . I never know what I will be do from week to week . a good flashlight be worth its weight in gold to I . I have have my 2aa lead light now for just over 3 month now . it have be in crawl space , some of they dry . countless non light basement . I really like the fact you can reduce the power , use it as a strobe , SOS , or a regular flashlight . Great think on mag 's part . all in all , they be worth the money . if anyone be look for a great gift idea for just about any guy , this be it . ok I know there be a lot of gal out there that would think they be cool too . talk about a great stock stuffer .
Flashlight	POS	5	it be a AMAZING FLASHLIGHT for the size . it have the lite intensity of a ordinary twin d-cell fashlight and will LAST EVEN LONGER . the ABILITY to adjust the beam be fantastic and it be SMALL SIZE mean I can carry it with me constantly . high quality and value for the buck be it be BEST POINTS .

I have to go back and order a size up , which I never have to do unless the band be really very wide all around . I should have realize since there be no graduation to the band and it be the same size all around that this could be a problem if it be not exactly true to size . I have other band of this width where the size be not a issue , so I either get one just a bit off , or it do run small . otherwise great ring . I hope the next size up be not too big .
Jewelry	POS	4	product be as describe , I be happy with the ring and play with it often . I do warn you its a bit larger on you finger then a normal ring . when it be first take out the spinner jam a little but with repeat use it spin just fine now . Hope this be able to help .

Jewelry	POS	5	buy two of ring one for my mother and one for my father ... they love they , it be a great anny present . the ring be exactly how the picture show , so perfect !
Jewelry	NEG	1	go to a local jewelery shop . ring sizing be not possible on line , and this company take zero responsibility for the fact that you will most likely get it wrong . it bring a significant amount of misery to what be a very special day for I .
Jewelry	POS	5	very nice ring for a incredible price ! anyone who have see the ring and comment on they be astonish when they find out how much I pay for they . arrive in just a few day too .
Jewelry	POS	5	exactly what I be hope for . the Cubic Zirconia be sparkly and the perfect size . fit accurately and the color be perfect sterling silver . the only thing that make I a bit sad be the band , which get mark up a little somehow , either in warehouse or during transit , but luckily it be not enough to make I fuss , plus for the price , if need be I could replace it at some point rather than return it for ship cost that be pricier .
Jewelry	NEG	1	the ring look foggy and not clear . I wear it for two day 's and take it off . I 'll probably replace the stone with a better one because the setting be sterling silver .
Jewelry	POS	5	I purchase this ring for a friend who collect elephant . of course the elephant on the ring be nicely detail and set off in silver while the band of the ring be electroplate gold . the ring look like it cost far , far more than the paltry $ 20 charge .

Jewelry	POS	4	right when I order this ring , I could not wait to have it . when I receive it , I be astounded at the brilliance of it . it have great detail and the shine to it , as well as the size and weight . overtime , though , I find that the luster grow dull and `` gritty '' almost . even though it have lose the beautiful shine , I would still recommend it to anyone .
Jewelry	POS	4	ring arrive on time and look like it be picture . just be aware of the return policy . only 10 day to get a refund and a 35 % restock fee . combine with fedex cost to Canada , it be almost not worth send back for a exchange or refund . again , the ring arrive on time and as present , so overall they do a good job . would just like to see a more relax online return policy for a $ 70 ring .
Jewelry	NEG	1	I have order from Gem Ave before -lrb- 2x -rrb- the band be not 3mm and look cheap you get what you pay for . the package be rip and the box be what look like pull apart the plastic bag the boxed ring come in look like it have punch though . on top if I be want to return it I have to pay shipping which be cost of half the puchase not worth it I 'll give it to my niece very disappionted Gem Ave

I could send it back , but why ? with such a awesome ring , I really do not care if it fit snuggly or not . wear it on a finger that fit the best . great ring . beautiful shine . Discreet enough to not draw attention to the skull imprint . definitely a great buy if it i really retail at 3 figure .
Jewelry	POS	4	this be a very nice ring , after i misplace my other purity ring iam currently use this one . the only downside be it only come with 4 prong not 6 like view in the picture
Jewelry	POS	4	I be a anti-twilight , but a big fan of mother of pearl . I be specifically look for a small-sized mop and I find it do a search under jewelry . I do not know that it be a ea celeb creation to appease Twitards . I like the asymmetrical band setting , but ea should tell fan it be not a cabochon , but a flat mop -lrb- the photo be a bit deceptive -rrb- .

I have be want to buy a ring for quite a while now , and I love this one . the stone be gorgeous , it shine in low lighting . my only complaint be that the band have receive many scratch since I get it . . I blame it on my wear it almost non-stop , but then again I do not do anything extreme that I would expect to scratch it . the band be very thin , it have not lose it be shape , but it take some get use to a band this thin . overall , I still love this ring , the scratch be not enough to make I regret get it .

Jewelry	NEG	1	I buy three of these ring for my sister and I , and only one of they be in tact ! I have only have these for three day . they fall apart really easily and be impossible to put back together . save you money and you sanity ... if puzzle be in the title its probably not a good idea .
Jewelry	POS	4	although the pearl be of high quality , I find the size a lot smaller than I think . it almost be imbed in the setting ... unlike the photo where the pearl rise way above the setting ...
Jewelry	NEU	3	I buy this because I think it would be pretty and I have be look for a birthstone ring for some time now . I be not impress with the look of this ring . the stone be dull and have no life at all . I have never wear it and do not bother to return it . I guess you get what you pay for in this case .
Jewelry	POS	5	one of my co-worker have this ring from Tiffany 's . I love it so much , but be not ready to spend $ 250 on it . instead , I find this ring from Eve 's Addication . the ring size guide make it easy to determine , which size to select . the ring come in a small blue velvet bag and matching box . it be .925 sterling silver , which be the same quality of Tiffany jewelry . the back be hollow so it be not solid , which do not bother I because no one ever see it . I actually compare my ring to my co-worker 's and you could not tell much difference ! Eves Addiction also include a pair of cz princess cut earring since my purchase be more than $ 75 and I receive free shipping . this be the best $ 32 I have spend !
Jewelry	NEG	1	this ring be beautiful when I first purchase it . I have now wear the ring 3 time and the metal be as dull as a hub cap . it seem as though there be no rhodium plate on it at all ! unfortunately I do not wear the ring right when I buy it and wait 6 month until I lose some weight . I be very disappointed and I will not be order from Gem Ave again . think twice before order . if I could I would return this ring .
Jewelry	POS	5	we love this ring . everyone think it be real , include people who know what to look for . we will definitely be purchase from you again soon !
Jewelry	POS	4	so i be a girl and want a armor ring , i fall in love with the bird 's skull and want it ! i know it would have to be resize for my tiny finger but i still go ahead and order it , it do say `` adjustable '' after all . it be beautiful beyond word ! but not as adjustable as i would like . i take it to a jeweler to try to get it fix but since it be pewter , jeweler want nothing to do with it and say it 'll get ruin if he mess with it ... sooooo i be in need of a new jeweler so that i can finally wear it . : -lrb- -lrb-
Jewelry	POS	5	the emerald be the same color show on the site . the jewelry come in pretty box . Green draw attention until brown clothes . size be adequate -lrb- length 7 mm -rrb- and weight 2 gram -lrb- 10 oz -rrb- . the 6 diamond shine quite . the ring be comfortable and emerald highlight . a jewelry street sell this type of jewelry more expensive .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this to replace the lease modem -lrb- also DOCSIS 3.0 -rrb- from Charter . it provide equivalent performance , and you will save $ $ $ every month . no technical skill be require to install . write on paper the MAC address from the label on the back of the new modem . disconnect the old Charter modem and attach the coaxial internet cable to the new modem and plug modem into a electrical outlet -lrb- consider use a surge protector -rrb- . call Charter support to activate the new modem . the service technician will need the MAC address that you write on the paper . the whole process will take about 10 minute . Performance be great . I have have no problem with the modem . the speed usually exceed my 30\/3 service .
CableModem	POS	5	receive the unit fast and come in great condition . no issue and be easy to setup . keep in mind you will need to call Comcast after connect the unit and give they the MAC address to connect it on they side .
CableModem	POS	4	I wish I have buy this modem year ago instead of pay Comcast more than $ 800 for a rental during that time . -lrb- ... -rrb-
CableModem	POS	4	the product arrive intact . setup be easy . just need to plug in the cable , call Comcast , and the whole thing start to work . I have be use the modem for 2 month . so far , there have not be any problem . the price at $ 140 be certainly a bit steep . I have not do any deep technical datum gathering yet . simple internet speed test indicate the modem can certainly support the specific speed I order via Comcast . the only drawback be Motorola do not offer any warranty on the device . so beware about this fact before make you purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	the cable modem be extremely easy to set up . have the thing ready to go in 1\/2 hr . that include the call to comcast to register the product . very happy with the purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	even with a decent surge protector , my separate Netgear modem and Belkin router -lrb- both recent purchase -rrb- would need reboot after even brief power blip . and the wifi signal be weak . I be tell a combo unit would help , so go for this all-in-one unit . right out of the box , have no problem hook up and put in the wifus password . no need to use install disc . BUT , do have problem with Charter Comm 's try to complete the install . multiple try with they online `` modem replacement '' program be futile , and it take several try to get through on the phone . when I finally get a human on the line , all he need be the new Mac number and the rest of the install go quickly . strength of wifus and speed greatly improve over last system . now just wait on power blip to see what happen .
CableModem	POS	5	it be simple to connect and take only minute . have be use it for the past month and have absolutely no complaint . by purchase this modem , instead of rent the cable commpany , it will save I money . the longer I use it the more I save . there have be no problem with the connection whatsoever . I highly recommend this modem .
CableModem	POS	5	Works great . come with zero instruction or manual book , so I be confuse for a minute before realize that all you need to do be plug it for it to work . fast !
CableModem	POS	5	work great . this replace a old scientific atlanta modem from cox and my download increase by more than 5x 's -lrb- upload stay about the same -rrb- .
CableModem	POS	4	I have have this install on Comcast -lrb- North NJ -rrb- for the last week . so far it be work fantastic , operate well above what I would have expect to get off Comcast 's network . that be say it do appear to be somewhat sensitive to signal issue . I have to have a Comcast tech come out and help trace out a wire because the modem would go squirrely around 9:30 or 10 every night and then start work in the morning . we located and remove 2 splitter which have clean up the signal strength issue -lrb- it be run at the top of the spec would strength for outgoing and incoming message -rrb- . hopefully thing continue go well !
CableModem	POS	5	this be my first docsis3 wireless cable modem and have it install by the Comcast serviceman . I have earlier set up the router off line for wire and wireless functionality . the direction be easy to follow for set security and the various network . I like the ability to have a private network and a guest access point . speed test show over 30 mb download and 5 mb upload , however this change from day to day . the installer have never see over 3 mb upload speed . I have no issue with strength of signal . Modem be on a ground level floor and signal easily reach the second floor . other have comment on the heat this modem generate , I have the same experience , it simply run hot . there be a power adjustment that seem to allow the unit to run on 25 % , 50 % , 75 % and 100 % power setting . I will try the 75 % set to see if it run cooler without any loss in wireless signal or speed . I have a older docsis2 surfboard run on Wideopenwest service for a couple of year now with no issue . much more stable than my older two unit system have a separate modem and wireless router . my it friend recommend seperate unit , but I have have a good experience with the combined modem . give the cost comparison , this one win .
CableModem	NEG	1	absolutely terrible ! do not reach all area of we house -lrb- and its not a big house -rrb- and cant . handle multiple device . im disappointed and we be go to bee look for something better !
CableModem	POS	4	out of nowhere , I be have excruciatingly slow internet speed on Comcast . the Comcast tech advise that my Motorola sb 4100 be at the `` end of life '' and that I should upgrade . skeptical , I purchase this modem which be a DOCSIS 3.0 -lrb- and backwards compatible -rrb- modem . it work . I go from a 2mbp download speed to over 17mbp . what a difference . there be one installation glitch that you need to be aware of . when you hook up the modem -lrb- connect the coax cable , connect the ethernet cable , and plug it in , that be it -rrb- , and then try to get online , it will direct you to a Comcast self-activation screen -lrb- no other site be available -rrb- . after enter my account number and phone number and hit the `` next '' button , I get a blank screen , and nothing happen . so I call Comcast and they say that usually happen if you be do a upgrade ; it mostly work only for a new service connection . however , it be a simple matter to give the tech you MAC address and the serial number . after about 5 minute , while he stay on the line , it come alive , no problem . BUT , here be the thing : the serial number they need be the customer serial number . this be only find on the bottom of the Motorola box the modem come in . this be different from the `` s\/n '' serial number that be on the label that be on the instruction sheet and on the bottom of the modem itself . the customer s\/n have letter in it ; the regular S\/N have only number in it and be too long . my first Comcast tech do not know that and it take a day to sort it out . other than that , it work well with my iMac and Apple Airport Extreme Base wireless router . enjoy
CableModem	POS	5	we own a big house that be now a Bed and Breakfast . there be eight television and a lot of cable go to they ! the long cable to multiple television make for weak signal strength reception . the Motorola Signal Booster be now provide great digital quality to every part of the house ! I be more than please with the booster !
CableModem	NEG	1	do not waste you money . all cable company provide these item for free plus free installation . for those who insist on own one , beware : the modem do not last long . at most 2-3 year and than burn out . happen to I 3 time , the first last a few month , the second 2 year , the last almost a year , when it finally dawn on I : call Com ... they come , install , hi-fi have everything . beautiful !! no more worry .
CableModem	POS	4	Compact , small , lightweight , this modem function well . setup be easy -lrb- I do have to contact my internet provider -rrb- . my only quibble be that it lack a power shutoff button , so I leave it on all the time -lrb- be I to be go a extended time period , I would disconnect power -rrb- .
CableModem	POS	5	the review for the CISCO cm100 answer all of the question that I have before this item be purchase . price , the necessary step to activate , and the satisfaction each of the buyer have with the unit .
CableModem	POS	5	arrive quickly . Works great . just plug in and call Comcast . give they the number off the box and it work great . save I 5 buck a month .
CableModem	NEG	1	this modem work for a couple of week . and now it be not . I be not sure what be wrong with it , but it be definitely defective .
CableModem	POS	5	before ... erratic reception since area go digital . after ... no more freezing , pixeled pic , absent channel , etc. . solve what cable company could not . brilliant . Easy to install .
CableModem	POS	5	Super little gadget . beat have to rent one ! not a peep out of it . the cable installer be not sure if he could use it but call and all be well . so far , so good . I get it install in April and it be now August . not a single issue . I forget it be there , which be how it should be .
CableModem	POS	5	because they can not make enough profit off I , TW Cable start charge I $ 5 for rental of a modem they have give I for free for 6 year . it be a slight upgrade from the one I replace , although you can not really tell it from the performance . I plug it in , call TW to let they know -lrb- they have to do something in they office to get it recognize by the network -rrb- and I go right back to work on my computer .
CableModem	POS	5	my puppy decide to chew on my original charger for my broadband . this charger be a after market but it do it job without it i wouldnt be able to write this review because my internet still be down . very fast delivery although a bit high for a s & h for a wall charger
CableModem	POS	5	I have no complain at all with the modem . it do it be job and have not give I any trouble in the few month I have be use it .
CableModem	POS	5	I have Comcast Xfinity Performance , rate at 20 mb\/sec down , and 4mb\/sec up . this modem replace a lease rca dcm315r . speed test with the dcm315r be 15\/4 . the 6121 perform better with download speed of 25 mb\/sec , upload do not change .
CableModem	POS	5	I replace a older modem with this one . after Comcast set they program for it , there be no problem . I would recommend it and would buy it again .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem work well . achieve 56 mbp downstream with Comcast blast internet access service . connect reliably . be easy to configure : simply take it out of the box , connect cable and power lead , then let Comcast add the modem to its database so it allow it to connect . some review indicate the box can get hot , we have not see that .
CableModem	POS	4	use this modem with Comcast . I do not even have to call they to activate it . I just use the self-activation website and be up and run in less than 5 minute . I get this to replace a sb6121 because I want 8 downstream channel , plus the sb6121 run too hot and I have to have a fan blow on it . I be on the blast 25\/4 tier and with the sb6121 I be get 36.5 mbp down and 6.5 mbp up with Power Boost . with the dpc3008 I be get 36.1 down and 5.6 up with Power Boost . Kind of disappointing . like with the dpc3000 and dpc3010 , the dpc3008 's diagnostic screen be gimp to only show you the signal level . no channel frequency , no uptime , and no log . if Motorola can show all this information in a read-only format , why can not cisco ? another disappointment . as long as the modem work it be not that big of a deal , but detailed diagnostic information can be very helpful if you really need it . temperature wise the dpc3008 run cooler than the sb6121 and do not need a fan blow on it , so I 'll stick with it for now .
CableModem	POS	4	I have a high end workstation that I use for cad work . it have two gigabit ethernet port . I be never able to get team to work with the adapter and lately I have to turn off ipv6 and change some other setting in order to keep from drop my connection . other computer on my network be also experience slow connection . after do some research here and elsewhere I decide to try the Motorola Surfboard sb6121 since I be run and old sb5101 . initially I just run the ethernet cable directly into a laptop from the modem . when I power it on I keep get the modem reset that people be talk about . so I try connect to the modem by typing 192.168.100.1 into my browser . at first I could not connect then I finally do and be able to look in the log on the cable modem to see what be go on . the log show it continually reboot because of a t4 timeout . so I call Comcast and within a half a hour I be up and run . once I get my router hook back up I have to restart my computer a couple of time due to some IP address conflict . since then it have be work flawlessly . I be even able to enable team my network adapter ! I check my speed on speetest.net before and after the modem . my download speed do not change much but my upload speed double ! so far I be very happy !
CableModem	POS	5	we replace we old cable modem follow advice from Comcast and be not disappoint . we increase we download speed by 25 % and upload by 250 % . no problem with Comcast service rep for authorization for we Preformance service .
CableModem	NEG	1	this product be a steal item . I have to return . I have to pay 10 % for nothing . no worth to buy . I highly recommend do not buy .
CableModem	POS	5	I install my new Motorola SB6121 Cable Modem today . the cable connection and bootup of the modem complete without a hitch and I contact Xfinity Cable -lrb- Comcast -rrb- and speak with a internet specialist who take my HFC MAC ID number and my customer serial number off the box . after reboot the modem and router -lrb- wrt54gl -rrb- , I bring up the computer . at first I could not connect to the internet , but after I change my lan address it come up okay . the reason it do not come up right away be that the cable guy reset my router and the setting be all set back to the default . fortunately I have save my router setting prior to contact xfinity and when I restore they back to the setting I have , everything work perfectly . so be sure if you be use a router that you save you favorite setting before you do this modem change . it can be a real pain try to remember all the setting in the router that you may have change over the year . by the way , I never connect to the computer first . Modem , Router and Computer be all connected initially but be boot in that order . so far everything now be work fine and I hope that continue . a bit too early to say how this will work out over time , but at least it be save I $ 7 a month for the time be . by the way , the Xfinity guy be great , polite and very knowledgeable . good luck . UPDATE : it be be about a month since I write the above review and since that time the modem have work flawlessly . I know some folk say there be have run very warm , but I do not find that to be true . my modem be only slightly warm to the touch , but a whole lot cooler than a lot of my other electronic device . as far as I be concerned , this be a excellent modem and be work well with my xfinity -lrb- Comcast -rrb- account . download speed 20mb and upload speed 4mb . ca not beat that in my book . sure beat the lousy dsl service I previously have .  Motorola SB6121 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem
CableModem	POS	5	to establish some background , I have cox hsus and have be use this modem for about a week . I buy this modem to replace a trusty 6 year old Scientific Atlanta DOCSIS 2.0 modem that bite the dust . I really like how the sb6121 keep my speed constant day and night . the 4x4 channel bonding help alleviate the peak time slow downs associate with a busy\/overcrowded node . on the flip side , channel bonding also help you isp enforce the cap on you subscribe internet speed . on my old modem , I would often see 30 Mbps down -lrb- my advertised speed w\/powerboost be 20 mbp -rrb- . speed test indicate my speed be now lock at 20-20 .5 mbp throughout the day . yet interestingly , I be get 15 mbp up ; -lrb- more than quadruple the speed advertise for my connection tier -rrb- ! I guess cox be not enforce upstream speed cap that well at the moment . I love how Motorola let user access the full modem signal and log at 192.168.100.1 . activate the unit be a breeze - simply call cox and read they the modem MAC ID and customer s\/n from the bottom of the box the modem come in . I will post a update review after I have play with and test the modem for a few month .
CableModem	NEG	1	this be a update after own the modem for just over 30 day : originally give 4 Stars , I have reduce the rating to 1 star . the modem die after a month of use . that leave I stick without service for several day until the weekend could pass and the cable company technician check what the problem be with my Internet Service . after a great deal of checking and cross checking , a new Motorola modem be put in by my cable guy . they sell it for $ 75 -lrb- as oppose to Amazon 's $ 50 -rrb- but offer 1 year on-site warranty with immediate replacement and installation of a problem unit - not so bad a deal if you really need to be online for certain . the new Motorola Surfboard sb5101 be instantly recognize by my Linksys router - so the problem describe below with instalation of the Linksys cable modem wre not encounter . it strike I as odd that there would be less compatability between a Linksys router and modem than between a Linksys router and Motorola modem . I get a LinkSys modem because of the good review , but also because I think it would `` play nice '' with my LinkSys router . my router be the WRT610N dual n-band so it be pretty good . when I get the modem I plug it in and give the MAC Address to my cable company . however , I could not get on the itnernet ; my cable company supply modem have work fine - I just get tire of pay the rental . they have I direct connect the modem to the computer - no problem . the problem be with the router ! the modem and router do not play nice together at all ! since my router be just over a year old , my call to LinkSys let I know they could tell I how to configure the router to get it work ... but it would cost $ 29 . to do so . they product do not work so well together , so they charge to make they work ! I refuse to pay . I get out my LinkSys Router CD , look up my router login and password and other info , then re-install the router . the reinstallation process fix it up so it get on the internet . if you get this modem and have a router , be prepare for a little hassle get it go . first impression of the modem after get it operational with the router be that it seem to provide faster internet access than the old modem from the calbe company do - though only marginally so , but still enopugh to notice . this seem to be a excellent modem and work really well . but , if you have a LinkSys wrt610n -lrb- and probably any other LinkSys router -rrb- be prepare for a little extra work to get the modem go .
CableModem	POS	4	I just love this super fast modem . its be a few month now since I get it and its totally dependable and super fast . its be work day and night with no problem since I receive it ... super fast with high response .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this before Comcast install my new service , but I could not get it to work at the time of my self-activation . I put it aside for a few week and come back to it . after have Comcast 's " Ubee " brand for a few week , which cap at 44mbp -lrb- we be suppose to have a 50mb line -rrb- , I decide to try one night to just plug in the Motorola to see what would happen . it take a while , maybe 20 minute and 5 reset , before the modem finally download the firmware it be suppose to which allow the Comcast " self-activation " screen to appear . after this point it be smooth sailing , though it take 30 more minute for the Comcast activation to work . the best part ? Speedtest now run at a solid 54.78 mbp ! I have run speedtest probably 20 time over the last week and it have never move off that number . that be get my money 's worth and also not pay Comcast for a slower modem .
CableModem	NEG	1	buy this before read the review , and it turn out to be total junk . my cable company , whose name be prominently display on this thing 's box , spend 2 hour on the phone with I and we could not get this thing to work at all , so come back here to Amazon and go with a surfboard - which work perfectly out of the box , take the cable company two minute to activate and do . do not waste you time with this turkey . too bad there be not zero star .
CableModem	POS	4	the modem be serve it be purpose . I feel that we receive a quality product and the price be reasonable . a friend of mine be the one who find this modem base on it ' review and rating .
CableModem	POS	5	excellent product at a great value . delivery be quick . setup be easy . work great so far . also purchase in conjunction with Belkin router and they be a great combo .
CableModem	POS	5	after be sick of Comcast raise they fee , I finally buy my own modem . I have only have it about 2 week now , but it have be great . my speed be pretty much the same as the rental modem be and that a good thing . if you be think about buy a modem , go with the cm100 . for the price and performance , it can not be beat .
CableModem	POS	5	this be the same modem I receive from Comcast two year ago , back then I be charge $ 2.00 a month for the modem , then 8 month later $ 5.00 , and now $ 7.00 . when this modem arrive -lrb- onetime -rrb- , I turn off the computer , disconnect it from the wireless router , connect the coax cable to new modem , connect the computer directly to modem . turn on modem , then computer . load the browser , Comcast 's `` self installation '' screen load , -lrb- have you bill handy -rrb- enter my account # , four click later , it be up and run no issue .
CableModem	POS	5	double my internet speed . Easy set up but you do need to call you cable provider and activate the unit . im with comcast , give they the serial number off the side of the modem and be on line in seconds . very well make product .
CableModem	POS	5	I use it to replace a lease comcast motorolum 5121 . the 5121 be give I 10mbps down\/0 .10 mbp up . after switch to the sb6121 , I now get 20 mbp down and 6 mbp up , which be the speed tier I be pay for + I do not have to pay comcast modem lease fee anymore . the speed measurement be do multiple time use speedtest.net . the installation be easy , have to get on the phone with a comcast tech to get the new modem enable , after that the modem work fine . UPDATE Sep 14 , 2012 . it be be a year since I have be use this . it be still go strong and work fine . I have add a manual timer to it so that the modem be reboot every weekend .
CableModem	POS	4	I buy this cable modem to get rid of the $ 5 , soon to be $ 7 , rental modem from Charter . I think I be purchase a new modem , but when the box arrive I see the refurbish labeling on the box ! I install it very quickly and it perform like new . I hope it last as long as the dsl modem that I have when I use AT&T; for Internet access !!!! I have all the download\/upload speed I could ask for with this modem ! I know Amazon will back it even though it be a refurbish unit !!!
CableModem	POS	5	Works as advertise ! a must have if you main cable line be over 50 ' , you have mutiple splitter , or live in a appartment .
CableModem	POS	5	I be use the sb6121 cable modem with Comcast cable . setup be fast and easy . plug in the box in place of the old one , and call Comcast . the service representative know what he be do . it take about 20 min from when I call to everything work properly -lrb- include hold time -rrb- . Make sure to have the MAC address handy when you call . for this packaging , the MAC be on the sticker on the bottom of the unit , as well as inside the cardboard packaging on the sticker on a paper strip . the indicator on the box be great . the receive and transmit indicator be bright blue if it detect a docsis 3.0 connection , green if it detect a docsis 2.0 connection . these receive , transmit , and online indicator be steady if connect properly . very easy to know the status at a glance from across the room . a note : on initial powerup -lrb- before call Comcast -rrb- , the receive \/ transmit light settle on green , and that have I wonder what be go on . it turn out that Comcast have to get the correct profile download on the box , and the right configuration setup at they end before the indicator be meaningful .
CableModem	POS	5	I have have this modem for about a month now . it work flawlessly . in fact it increase my speed from roughly 20mb\/s to 40mb\/s over cox . its a nice compact unit , and have a couple keyhole for wall\/shelf mount .
CableModem	POS	5	Great little unit . reliable . cheap and all yours -lrb- no `` leasing '' the thing from you cable company ! -rrb- . I have use this in three install and they just work . they be great value for money if you get a refurb and very reliable in my experience . not much more I can say really . if you be look for a cable modem , this be it .
CableModem	POS	5	order this modem as it be on Comcast 's approve list with 3 star and have receive good rating and review on other site . it replace we modem that be past useful age and keep drop the connection . very easy to setup . install it , call Comcast , give they the MAC number and that be it . no more disconnect and it seem to have add some speed to we connection . would suggest that it be install where there be plenty of air circulation . tend to run a little warm . Vendor ship the product promptly . pleased with my purchase decision .
CableModem	POS	5	Cable modem be not something for you to take care of in daily life . a good modem should be install and forget . it be the reason why I do not upgrade my modem from docsis-1 to docsis-2 until 2009 . I do not do it until I realize my internet speed be much slower than what Comcast promise then . that upgrade raise the average download throughput from 5 to 15mbp . I have be use the same internet service for more than one decade . the cable company promise 1.5 mbp at very begin . with the same monthly rate they push up they promise speed gradually . the speed be raise to 20mbp recently . but you can not enjoy the speed boost if you keep use you old hardware . my 3-year old Motorola sb5101 be also a good install and forget modem . but the connection speed can become very slow in evening , the rush hour of residential internet . docsis-3 provide the channel bonding feature which be better in retain bandwidth even in rush hour . you must contact the cable company to activate you new cable modem before use it . it be not a big deal for I because I do it twice in past decade , but I can not recall all the detail . the first Comcast specialist try to activate my sb6121 many time w\/o luck so that he transfer my call to a 2nd tier specialist . he ask I to power-cycle my modem -lrb- shut down then turn on again -rrb- , then it work flawlessly . yes , power-cycle be a necessary step in activation . the first specialist forget it and waste I almost one hour . my download speed be quite stable -lrb- 16 ~ 21mbp -rrb- now , even in evening . the throughput be only slightly faster but much more consistent than before . it work as promise . Internet technology keep evolve so that you can not always install and forget it . update -- I replace my old Linksys router with e3200 one month later . now the download speed be always fix at 25mbp , 24\/7 . look like 25mbp be the speed cap set by Comcast . the sb6121 + e3200 combo should be able to run even faster if I be willing to pay higher monthly rate . once again you need up-to-date gear in order to get full bandwidth from the internet connection you pay for .
CableModem	POS	5	I replace my old Motorola modem with the sb6121 and double my download and upload speed . it be a great value and easy to setup with Comcast .
CableModem	POS	4	Linksys CM100 , be a good product and installation be pretty simple and straight forward and have be perform to satisfaction .
CableModem	POS	4	I purchase the Motorola SB6121 SURFboard DOCSIS 30 Cable Modem in December 2011 . it be deliver promptly and be reasonably package . it appear that all of the equipment be present . the installation be reasonably easy and connected to all of my device without problem . seem to be a speedy little unit to surf the web and have not have any problem to speak of yet .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this modem to replace my DOCSIS 2 Motorola Modem and be really impress by how well this modem work . I have Mediacom and this modem instantly do channel bonding on the downstream . I have be pull 30meg down and I only pay for 20 so it be great !
CableModem	NEU	3	the modem be easy to set up and it work well most of the time . I have trouble with it when I do video chat . I always lose the signal .
CableModem	POS	5	this be a great modem , simple to install just call you isp to activate it . no issue so far after activation , speed be good and set by you isp once they be ready to increase you internet speed you be ready for next few year until the next DOCSIS technology come .
CableModem	POS	5	I switch from dsl to cable . I have a Linksy router and this modem plug in and work great . it do not overheat like the modem I have for dsl . another feature be a usb connection with cord for those want to connect this way . I be get up to 15 mb download from my Charter cable connection . so much more efficient then the dsl phone line connection which would have a slower rate in the evening .
CableModem	POS	4	I buy one of these baby because it be by far the cheapest modem I could find out there , and because with Amazon Prime , shipping be lightning fast . I have Comcast by the way . it work great for 4 or 5 day , and then a major Thunderstorm hit my area and there be a few power spike . the modem just stop work . none of my other electronic device be affect -lrb- include my router , which be not connect to a surge protector , my modem be -rrb- . I guess that the electrical current that kill the modem come from the cable jack , not the power supply . I be pretty upset , but I buy another one from the same seller the day after -lrb- 30 dollar be not worth the anguish of deal with Linksys customer support -rrb- , and this time I get a surge protector that insulate the power supply , as well as the cable input . be run great for 2 week now . moral of the story : protect you investment , you internet depend on it .
CableModem	POS	5	Modem be compact fast and do what it be suppose to do . worked right out of the box with no problem and be very easy to hook up .
CableModem	NEG	1	guy , I buy this about 6 month ago and it just die . do not waste you money and look for something else . I be go to check out a Netgear product now .
CableModem	POS	4	I need a reliable modem so I can work from home . buy modem be not exciting by any measure , but this one get the job do .
CableModem	POS	5	work like a charm right out of the box with Comcast , no setup require . the only gotcha be with my AirPort Extreme , just make sure you turn the modem off before plug it in because the modem cache the MAC address of the last device it be plug into .
CableModem	POS	4	my prior modem be a DOCSIS 1.1 model from linksy which have a web base user interface point out in the ship installation Guide . I would have give this Motorola modem a perfect rating if the ship box also include info on how to access the modem 's user interface via a web browser . fortunately , on the motorola.com site I find a detailed pdf installation Guide with the web interface IP address that make up for the miss info . the web address be -lrb- ... -rrb- some people complain about the heat discharge by the modem but I do not think it be hot enough to cause any problem as long as the modem be keep in a well ventilate space .
CableModem	POS	5	after Comcast increase my rental rate for they modem to $ 5\/month and after 8 year , decide to buy my own modem . Works great and be rather easy install . if you be on a mac and use wireless , it be much easier to use ethernet connection for the initial hookup .
CableModem	NEG	1	Stinks , be a lousy modem , give less than 1\/2 speed advertise . I be gonna try buy.com instead . or eBay , shopping.com , of anyone other than AMD .
CableModem	POS	5	it arrive shortly after order . the prong on the plug be a little bent , but I just get out the pliers and fix it . just plug everything in how comcast , or whoever , have theirs set up and you be almost there . the next time you try to log on to the internet , it will walk you through how to register it and then internet will be yours and you will no longer have to pay comcast they 7 dollar every month for a little box that you can install all by yourself .
CableModem	POS	5	I have Comcast internet , and activate this modem be not too bad at all . I have to go through the activation screen about 5 time or so , but it finally work . the modem itself be a breeze to set up , and it be give I a rock-solid connection . I be very happy !
CableModem	POS	4	I be write this in late December , have purchase the unit in September . I 'll put this review in three section : the good , the bad and `` the neutral '' -- the good -- once it be set up I really have no complaint . I purchase a combo cable modem\/switch\/broadband router with wifus and that be exactly what this unit be and do rather effectively . since I buy this unit at the same time I sign up for the comcast account I have nothing to compare it to . my main computer be also connect through a `` ethernet over powerline '' set of adapter which add several m of latency so I can not even comment on that . both wire and wireless connection have be nothing but stable as long as I have have it . my apartment be small so it be not difficult to blanket it with wifus signal . I do not have a 802.11 n device so I can not comment on that . I have a roku box connect directly to the unit and it very rarely if ever drop off . when it do I know it be either comcast or netflix with the issue -lrb- s -rrb- . this unit do seem to have a incredible list of feature built-in . it be like the manufacturer just go through a long check list of every feature imaginable and dump it in . I have only barely scratch the surface on all the feature either because I do not need they or because I could not figure out how to set it up -lrb- see the bad -rrb- . I find out later it be fact possible to use this unit soley as a cable modem , bypass the nat\/router functionality . -- the Bad -- if you ever want to actually use this device for anything outside of the default functionality put on you googling hat and get ready to spend some time : it be quite difficult to figure out what anything be just from the interface and the pdf manual have very minimal explanation of even what the various abbreviation mean never mind how to set they up . for instance I want to utilize the `` guest wifus '' feature so I could set up a old pc with a wifus card that do not support WPA -lrb- I want a wep along side my primary wpa network -rrb- . it be not that critical and I do not want to spend very much time on it but I could not seem to set this up . I be sure if I have spend several hour search the internet and experiment I could have come up with a solution . but this should not be necessary . either the uus should be intuitive enough to set it up , it should be document how to set it up step-by-step or at the very least there should a link some where on Zoom 's site to a third party site that describe how to make it happen . the same go for use this unit purely as a cable modem so I could use my own preferred broadband router -lrb- a linksy with tomatoe firmware -rrb- . I browse the various setting , look up abbreviation in wikipedium . then I google those abbreviation . eventually I find the setting and successfully set up my seperate router -lrb- I find the real solution on a random blog talk about a different modem ... -rrb- . this should not be necessary and be not something 99.99 % of costumer be go to bother with . -lrb- the setting be call `` RgPassThrough '' . recommend disable of wifus , dhcp and NAT , and put the MAC address of the router you want . I never would have guess `` RgPassThrough '' . -rrb- I would also mention the apparent lack of any way to update this modem 's firmware . perhaps this be a regulation put on they by the cable industry but it just seem inexcusable to I in this day and age of network exploit and malicious bot roam the internet . -- Neutral -- since I do not know who be at fault for this issue I be not blame the modem directly : it take more than a hour and at least two different comcast representative to successfully activate this modem . there be only so much the representative could tell I but it sound like it just do not want to talk to comcast 's end . the activation be attempt over and over again for 45 minute or so before it finally just inexplicably start to work . the representative have no explnation . I later attempt to activate a different Motorola modem at the same location and have the exact same issue which lead I to believe it be not the modem but rather the cabling or whatever software\/hardware comcast have on they end . it be very , very frustrating -lrb- never do get the second modem to work -rrb- . once the zoom be activate it could deactivated\/activated instantly with no issue . it be just that initial attempt that be time consuming . again , this could be unique to my region and\/or my particular comcast office for all I know . I live in northern California just outside of Sacramento . -- conclusion -- I be give this device four star for the lack of documentation and non-intuitive web interface . I like the list of feature and as far as I can tell be very effective as a cable modem\/broadband router .
CableModem	POS	4	very quick response to email , product work great ! although it be miss the cable wire it be suppose to come with which i be guess it be suppose to be the ethernet cord .
CableModem	POS	4	I move from a rent modem to this one . it be easy to setup and I could use it right away . since I already check if the modem be compatible with the network provider -lrb- Charter -rrb- , it might have help I . of course , I do not see much spike in speed after move to DOCSIS 3.0 modem , but it might be due to Charter not provide speed of DOCSIS 3.0 . I also do not have the problem of restart the modem . hopefully it do not throw new surprise . ; - -rrb-
CableModem	POS	5	I take a chance and buy a refurbish unit that look almost new -lrb- I notice a few light scratch -rrb- . installation with Comcast do not go smoothly with the automatic procedure but after a phone call to Comcast , it be up and run in a few minute . I have have it run less than a week and in that time the whole system have only crash once -lrb- typical for I -rrb- . I run a speed test with the old modem right before I install the new modem . the old one clock in at 35 mp download and the fastest I have get with the new be 24 mb . slower , but not noticable in my app and I can still stream high-def Netflix well . I read somewhere that it may not download as fast as older model but that it should maintain it be speed better throughout the day . in any case , it seem to work as fast as the original Arris modem that be cost I $ 7 a month . so far I be happy with it ! PS my home phone be now on the internet with magic Jack and that work very well and I need my modem to stay on 24-7 so I be hope this modem work a long time without crash . I have the one crash and be here to fix it quickly -lrb- simple unplug , wait a few seconds , then plug it back in -rrb- . hopefully those will be rare .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem be very easy to set up . it only take one phone call to Comcast , and it have work like a charm since .
CableModem	NEG	1	this modem only last 7 week and rarely work correctly during that time . very disappointed that I didnt keep box so I cant send back
CableModem	POS	5	tired of pay rental charge to the evil cable co so I decide to buy my own . after some research this once come out on top . bought and be a little nervous . so simple to install and take up so much less space than the clunker from the cable co. . glad I switch !
CableModem	POS	5	plug and play , no problem install and have work great for over a month now . will need to call you isp to get it connect to internet , take about 10 minute .
CableModem	POS	5	while look for way to cut down my cable bill , I search around and find this modem . check the approve modem list , this be on there , order it up , few day later it be in my hot little hand . after a quick call to the cable provider -lrb- who need the MAC address -rrb- , it be up and online . I be use this with a Netgear WNR2000 that be flash with dd-wrt , rock solid with no issue so far . definitely one of the easier computer-related project I have do around the house this year : d
CableModem	POS	5	I recently have to install tuning adapter for my TiVo box in order to receive certain high definition channel from Time Warner . these adapter drop the signal down from around 93 to 44 as measure by the TiVo signal strength function . I have a passive 4:1 splitter in the attic which work fine until these adapter be install . after the tuning adapter be install some of the channel would get the dreaded digital signal drop-out . I install this signal booster which take about 15 minute - most of which be just to tie the cable back neatly . now I have 90 to 100 signal level on all of my TiVo box and the picture quality be great . I do not use this on my internet connection as it be run separately from my other cable . product feel very solid and well build . I have only have it a couple of week , so can not comment on the long term reliability , but so far it be a great little unit .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this for my cable modem and I notice a speed increase . the cable guy come by to replace my cable modem and even he notice a significant speed increase with he bandwidth measure device . this will save you lot of time when streaming and download thing off the internet , however , you might be spend more time on the internet since everything will be that much faster .
CableModem	NEG	1	I buy this modem as a replacement for my comcast-rented DOCSIS 2.0 modem , and it work great when I connect my computer directly to the modem . when connect through my Apple Airport Extreme 802.11 n -lrb- 1st generation -rrb- router , though , I begin to see problem . Whenever I be do anything that use a substantial portion of my bandwidth -lrb- e.g. download large file or watch Netflix streaming -rrb- , after a couple of minute I would begin to see ping time to test server rise and eventually stop altogether . the connection would effectively drop for a minute or two , and then it would come back . my problem be very similar to the one report at -lrb- ... -rrb- I have use this router successfully with my prior cable modem , so there must be some incompatibility between the modem and my router . I also know other have report no problem with airport extreme router and this modem -lrb- though I do not know which generation of the airport Extreme they be use -rrb- .
CableModem	POS	5	I recently switch from dsl to high speed internet , basically from CenturyLink to Charter . while talk with the Charter rep , I manage to find the listing of all the modem that they lease out and come across this beauty . I decline to lease this modem from they , as they want $ 7 a month , so you basically buy two of these modem over the course of a two year contract . so this be a no-brainer and I buy it . the technician that come out be surprise to see this modem while hook everything up as the DOCSIS 2.0 modem can not handle very high speed , and this be where the DOCSIS 3.0 come in . I be download speed up to 50 mbp now . I just have to change my wireless router setting to DHCP and the DOCSIS 3.0 take over and I be on my way to the high speed superhighway ! I do not have to go into the modem GUI to mess with any setting either . so basically I hook this up from the coax cable in the wall , feed a cat6 cable from it to my wireless dual band router , set my router to DHCP , and everything on my network instantly have connection . its worth the money if you be look to get speed of over 30mbp to you home and lease one from the cable company be just a waste of money in my opinion .
CableModem	POS	5	deliver in two day , and setup within 20 minute . the latency be about half that of my old -lrb- 10 yr . -rrb- modem , and the speed be noticeably better to . I wish that I would buy it sooner .
CableModem	POS	5	absolutely amazing difference in analog picture quality ! I use a two way splitter to run a line straight to my cable modem as recommend and attach the other cable to the Motorola Booster . from the booster I use three of the four hookup for signal to three tv , one of which I split again with a good two way splitter so that I could drop a line to my computer tv card . before I have horizontal line on many of the channel and a couple be almost unviewable . the line be all go now and the picture on all three analog tv and the computer be terrific ! a unintended side effect be that my cable modem throughput have also increase because it be now be route straight to the computer from the original two way splitter . I wish that I have do this year ago ! if you have analog tv with fuzzy or striped picture I highly recommend this booster !
CableModem	POS	5	this modem work like a charm . I buy this to replace my Comcast rental . I have to call Comcast and give they the MAC ID that be on the box of the modem . afterwards , the installation be a breeze . I just plug in the coax and then power it on . when all the light stabilize , it be good to go . stabilization take about 5-7 min . I actually get 1.5 time more speed than my previous modem .
CableModem	POS	4	I replace a old Ambit unit which seem to be over heating and cause connection issue to the LinkSys cm100 and its be work great for the past few day . I have to call into the isp and have they provision the new modem with be MAC Address and then all be work great . I have notice it handle traffic great , my connection be consistent and most off all I have not lose a internet connection at the modem in a few day ... finger still cross . so far , it seem like a sound product . great price refurbish and I keep the old Ambit one -lrb- which they charge we $ 70 for 3 year ago -rrb- just in case . I give it 4 star because it would have be a great 5 star if it support docsy 3.0 too .
CableModem	POS	5	I use this unit for about a month with Comcast cable . this unit replace the rental from Comcast -lrb- I get tire of pay they $ 7 every month -rrb- . call the company , give they the MAC address and in 5 minute I be back online . so far it seem to work just fine . moderate improvement on the speed and reliability ; satisfy with the purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	there really be not a lot to say . I need a DOCSIS 3 modem and it work like it should . upgrade my Internet speed , consistently get above 50 mbp down . set up be easy , pretty much plug in and let you provider have it be MAC address . indicator light be easy to read . overall , very satisfied with the modem .
CableModem	POS	5	Modem be not plug and play . spend about 45 minute on the phone with Comcast to get modem working . have to supply the serial number and MAC ID number . however , when I get it work , my speed go from 13mb download with the my old Motorola Surfboard to 33mb download with the 6120 . similarly , upload go from 1.3 mb to 6mb . Works great once it be configure with you isp .
CableModem	POS	5	this work great while i have it , I upgrade my service and could no longer use it . this be a great modem if you play game or do video online .
CableModem	POS	4	Took Comcast about 2 hour to install , over the phone , late August 17 , 2012 . laptop gigabit controller would not properly recognize modem and would run only at 10 mb instead of 1000 . use a Dell XPS l511z to connect to modem . when I hook the laptop up before call Comcast the LAN would run at 1000 mb . Comcast could not get the lan to run over 10 , so they suggest try another computer . use a older xp m140 laptop purchase 6 year ago but run Windows 7 and it work at its network card 's max rate , 100 mb . restart modem and then hook it to Netgear router -lrb- 100 mb WAN input -rrb- and it seem to work fine with wire lan run at 100 mb , but the internet do go out unexpectedly once but start right up when I reset the router , but not the modem . the modem show it be get a internet connection , but the router show no internet connection . have Comcast blast -lrb- advertise here in dc metro area at 50 down\/10 up -rrb- . Got letter from Comcast recommend upgrade to 3.0 modem and this modem get they 3 star test and be recommend . previous modem Motorola SB5101 work fine and be 5 year old , but its download max be about 38 and sometimes just over 40 , but speed vary a lot and it be never consistent . upload be usually less than 4 . with sb6121 , speed be consistently 52 download and 10 upload . wifus download be about half the wire rate when the laptop be close to router , use Netgear usb 72 mb wireless . wifus upload be 10 . it seem to be work well .
CableModem	POS	4	... it seem that various isp be break FCC regulation and Federal Law by refuse to activate some newer modem , in a attempt to force user to use a `` lease '' modem . there be a essentially identical version of this device , the sb6141 , which be the `` isp lease '' version of this . you can not buy that , at least not `` officially , '' mind you . Time Warner Cable have just have I on the `` loop '' for the past two and a half hour , and I be still on hold as I write this . they be tell I that the device be not on the `` approved list '' and thus can not be activate on they system . this , of course , be patent nonsense . all they require in order to access any device be -lrb- a -rrb- a device which speak the same electronic `` language '' -lrb- in this case , DOCSIS 3.0 , which TWC Austin support fully , and brag about support fully -rrb- , and -lrb- b -rrb- a valid , unique hfc MAC ID code . the MAC ID be what allow the two device -lrb- the isp 's `` source '' modem and you modem -rrb- to talk to each other , as the isp need to know that the ID it be talk to be a id which it be suppose to talk to , and they need to speak the same language . that be all that be REQUIRED ON ANY TECHNICAL BASIS whatsoever . it be a violation of Federal Law and FCC regulation for a isp to refuse to service any device which have a valid , unique , and `` not steal '' MAC ID and which use a approve communication protocol . those of you who have be tell `` Comcast will not support this '' or , as I just be , `` Time Warner will not support this , '' please realize , you be be rob , every bit as much as if they put a gun to you head and tell you to hand over you wallet . it be a crime for they to do this . I be currently on hold , with a `` customer advocate '' at Time Warner , attempt to get my personally-owned , legally-required-to-be-supported device add to my account . \*\*\*\*\*\* okay , after a long dialog where I quote letter and verse of Federal law to the `` advocate , '' I get they to add my modem to my account . and it be work flawlessly . I would not ordinarily post thing not specifically about the device on a review of the device , but in this case , I feel like it be necessary , as some folk may believe they have get a defective piece of hardware -lrb- base upon what the isp tell they -rrb- when this be not the case . my ping time have improve ... which be somewhat surprising to I , honestly ... from about 58m to around 20m . I be not sure why that be the case , but it be a good indication that I have a better connection -lrb- lower ping time mean less delay between when you send something at one end and when it be receive at the other end , basically -rrb- . my throughput be much more consistent and level , and I have not see any of the disconnection error I have see repeatedly with my older -lrb- DOCSIS 1.0 -rrb- modem . it seem to be perform flawlessly . if you have a internet service provider -lrb- isp -rrb- who have support for DOCSIS 3.0 -lrb- the latest iteration of the modem-interaction-language standard -rrb- , this be a great choice . just be prepare to have to argue a bit with you isp , who seem , in many case , to be do everything possible to get you to lease one from they instead of buy you own . once they give in and agree to activate the MAC code on they system , this will work just fine on ANY current isp , and will provide full DOCSIS 3.0 support on any DOCSIS 3.0-supporting network . do not let the script-reading `` support '' type tell you otherwise .
CableModem	POS	4	I buy this modem to replace my cable modem . this modem work great . the installation be very simple and easy . and since then I have have no problem .
CableModem	POS	5	a return this item because rcn -lrb- my cable company -rrb- have trouble get it to work . if you want to be frugal and save that $ 5\/mo . it be worth the purchase !!
CableModem	POS	5	to decide which DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem to use , 1st go to DOCSIS Devices MyDeviceInfo on Comcast to see what they support and possibly recommend by certification . for my money , only 2 option :  Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem  choose the later , newer model . more widely use sb6120 be test only to level 2 . Comcast claim to have test sb 6121 to more stringent level 3 certification . Hope to future proof with use this newer model . have not notice , as other , heat to be a problem . Install & SetUp be easy . help reading comment from user -lrb- Comcast employee -rrb- with sb6120 . do not try Comcast self activation web page since this be a modem change and not a new install . plug sb6121 into WAN Cable with nothing else attach . then call Comcast Tech support . change from Linksys BEFCMU10 v4 DOCSIS 2.0 to Motorola SB6121 DOCSIS 3.0 . Comcast see Device , send refresh signal . Voila ! then connected pc direct to Cable Modem . finish with Comcast Tech support . take maybe 20 minute on phone to verify all be work . final hookup with router , in the mix , and clone pc MAC Address into Router . do processing ! accord to sb6121 log , sw download successful - Via Config file , SW Download INIT - Via Config file . MAC Address Identified . light , Camera Action . Houston , we have connection ! be it faster than what we have ? no. . why Upgrade ? concerned about end of Life Devices for what we have .  cisco-linksy befcmu10 Ethernet Cable Modem  prior version do . piece of mind to stay one step ahead of obsolescent technology . why buy vs. rent ? not fond of rent . will pay for its self in less than a year . try RoadRunner Cable Modem then later try Comcast Cable Modem neither of which would connect reliably . both have weak signal require a service call mean down time . purchase Cable modem would always work . have own 2 linksy befcmu10 v4 DOCSIS 2.0 Cable modem . purchase for $ 20.00 each -lrb- elsewhere -rrb- when they be sell for $ 80.00 each , so have a backup . First Linksys befcmu10 v4 buy the farm during a lighten strike . yes , even on a UPS . the lighten strike take out the Cable Modem and a D-Link 8 Port Gigabit switch . two router , in line for security , in between be untouched . now that I think of it , 1 router lose 1 Port leave 3 more port to use . unfortunate but still a usable device . second linksy befcmu10 v4 have work until now . have sit on shelf for backup \/ book end . happy with decision to go sb6121 Gigabit Cable Modem to  D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router  and if we ever upgrade we Comcast to 100baset or Comcast upgrade to ipv6 , wow . I can dream !
CableModem	NEG	1	just google for ` cisco dpc3008 customer support ' and you 'll see that one of the top hit be the comcast customer forum where hundred of people complain about the dpc3008 drop internet connection . because this modem be list on Comcast 's web site as a approve modem , I buy one 3 month ago . I have have nothing but trouble with it and to my surprise , discover that many other people be experience the same problem . under somewhat heavy load such as streaming a movie , the modem drop the internet connection . the only solution be to use a different modem . I replace the dpc3008 with a Motorola surfboard and have not have any problem . I would stay away from the dpc3008 , it do not work reliably . it 'll be the last Cisco product I ever purchase .
CableModem	POS	4	when charter cable up the rental fee to $ 7 a month it become silly not to buy we own modem . I buy this Motorola surfboard base on good review , and after 5 month of use it have prove very reliable , offer consistent , reasonably high speed without need to be re-plugged more than once . it be only drawback be a few design flaw . note : other have describe this modem as nearly identical to the Motorola surfboard sb6120 except more expensive and with a prettier but warmer-running case . normally this would steer I toward the older model but because some charter user experience firmware problem that turn they sb6120 into brick , I go with the newer model just to be safe . the price be still quite reasonable consider that after one year it will have pay for itself in rental fee . pro : so far we have speed equal to the modem we use to rent , and occasionally higher . it be easy to set up and only once have I have to unplug the modem to get internet working , although that may have be a problem with the router . it be important to note that unless you be pay big buck for super-high speed you may not be get d3 rate anyway . but unless you be strap for cash or certain that you will never , ever upgrade , it be not a bad idea to have the option and plan for the future . con : the sb6121 be sometimes warm to the touch . I would not describe it as hot . however , we have it free standing -lrb- not stack beneath something else -rrb- and in the cool basement , so it be not a problem . the illuminate led icon be easy to see but the icon themselves be somewhat obscure . it be useful to know that the top icon actually change color depend on the speed of you connection -lrb- which will also depend upon the computer its connect to -rrb- so if you get a amber light , do not assume the modem be not work . there be no reset button on the modem , as some version of this model seem to advertise . this be not a huge drawback for I . Bottom Line : for steady speed equal to what we be rent , a reasonable price in the long run , ease of setup , and long period of internet without interruption , I give this modem 4 star . for the minor flaw of chare more for a new case that run on the warm side and be needlessly cryptic with its cute icon I take off one star .
CableModem	POS	5	I have 2 house set up with 2 different cable company , both of which use the Motorola SB6121 Modem . initially , I use a Motorola Modem with a 1.0 docsis at my Florida home but internet service be intermittent . I replace the modem with the sb6121 and the problem be cure . when Mediacom start charge a monthly fee at my Iowa home , I immediately purchase another sb6121 and return the Mediacom Modem . the Motorola sb6121 perform flawlessly in both Florida and Iowa home and that be the name of the game : reliability .
CableModem	POS	5	I purchase a refurbish one and it work great . it be less expensive than the other . I would recommend it .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem work right away on Comcast 's network . just have to go through the provision process and register over the phone .
CableModem	NEU	3	I buy this because I be move to Comcast Internet , and I want a fast modem that would not give I any trouble . unfortunately , the first one keep power cycling when I get it hook up . I call Motorola tech support , who tell I that a low sigal to noise ratio be cause the power cycle . I call Comcast , and they tech come out and fix the low snr problem , but the modem keep power cylcing . he replace it with a Comcast modem , which work just fine . the replacement modem that I get work fine , but I be only rating this 3 star because of the hassle I have to go through get it to work .
CableModem	POS	5	this cable modem work great with my Comcast service in the Bay Area . I have blast service which be advertise to provide 30 mbp download speed , and I get over 30 mbp with this modem connect to my 4 year old laptop when I perform a speedtest on the comcast website . it also show over 6mbp of upload speed . keep in mind that this be the case when I connect the router directly to the laptop with a ethernet cable . if you attach a wireless router it will most likely not give you the same result but that be due to the wireless router . I get over 20 mbp with the linksy e3200 wireless router which I buy to complement this cable modem and I would recommend the Linksys e3200 if you be look for a fast dual-band wireless router to pair up with this modem . as for the installation , it could not have be easier for I . Comcast have originally rent I this same modem for 7 month -lrb- $ 49 I throw away in rent -rrb- so when the new modem arrive , I simply disconnect the old ubee modem and plug in the new uBee Docsis 3.0 Cable Modem . when I turn on my firefox internet browser it divert I to the comcast installation page where I follow the step -lrb- you need you account number -rrb- and within a few minute it detect the new modem and I have internet ! simple as that , no need to call comcast in my case or look for any MAC address . keep in mind that this be probably the case because I be rent the same exact ubee cable modem , but if you do need to call Comcast , the MAC address be easily accessible on the bottom of the cable modem . now 3 month after I buy the modem I have save $ 21 and I be happily continue to save with little to no issue in connectivity !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be awesome . run everything max would out , and super cool -lrb- sub 70c -rrb- the entire time . I actually can play two game at once with both hit V-Sync cap , which be awesome when you like MMO 's .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	purchase this card in May 2012 . switch the bio and no unlock shader . put the position back to stock , read the bio , modify and re-flash to the secondary bio , still same result , no unlock shader . still a good card though , but do not expect to unlock it unless you can get you hand on a older revision of this card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	THIS PRODUCT arrive on time . SORTA . UPS LEFT IT with the neighbor . not good but I catch it as it happen . video card run like a dream . game on . speed speed speed .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	just get this monitor adapter cord to hook up my second monitor . my computer only have one VGA port . I go to bestbuy and be tell I would have to spend upward of $ 100 to get a cord then a adapter for the cord in order to hook up dual monitor . I find this cord on Amazon and it work perfectly ! I be so excited . it be so easy to set up and now I have my dual monitor work ! Super fast ship too ! definitely recommend this product if you do not have two VGA port for a dual monitor setup .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	do not take my word for it , do a search on `` 560 ti 2gb artifact . '' you will find quite a few people with persistent similar problem who have also have to return this card multiple time . I be on my third card . after the first two I decide the problem must be something else on my system . now I have a new computer with a different brand of motherboard but the same graphic problem . evga send I a collection of test they want I to run even although the problem show up at the bio splash screen and have show up with this card install in two different computer . after all the time I have already waste test the multiple failure of this card this be the final straw . this be the fourth evga graphic card I have buy over the year . it will be my last .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I never write review . but this card be amazing . I be very skeptical at first , spend $ 400 + on a ` lottery card ' as people be call it . but with the new update from asus this card have be golden . OC have it a little with no problem , have not push it very far yet . I can play all my game on super high setting , there be shader and particle I never know exist ! I be in love . definately get a second for slus when I have extra money . love it !!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I must say , this product be amazing ! I be able to run ton of game on high or max setting , include Aion , Blacklight Retribution , Dragon Age 2 , dc universe , and League of Legends ! I love it do much . installation be pretty easy and I have never once install anything like this . just search YouTube for some guide and it 'll be a walk in the park . although , after first install it my pc do not recognize it but after a quick reboot it work like a charm . this should keep my computer able to run the newest game for year to come !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card help my 5 year old gaming system keep up with the newer game . this be a very very powerful card : -rrb-
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy the gtx570 2560 from another website , and this card be really great for gaming . I have everything ultra for sc2 and bf3 which run great . the only problem I encounter be the temperature , I read alot of review prior to my purchase , that mention this problem but I want something that be more future proof , so I decide to go for a high memory card . the card temperature stay at around 96 degree when I play bf3 and fan noise get loud at that point . I believe that the card be design to withstand higher temperature , however , I like to turn my evga precision on to check my card temp every time i play game . so i would suggest people who consider this card to go water cooling . p.s. when I buy this card it be sell out on like 5-6 major website that i go to , i be not sure if that be go to be the case in the future , but it might be something to do a research on if you think about SLI or buy one card at a time
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card run everything max out no problem . I have no problem put a additional overclock on the card beyond what the factory overclock be use EVGA 's precision x software . I be able to get +71 mhz of additional GPU clock offset and a additional +730 mhz additional memory clock offset . no stability issue , as fast if not faster than a reference 680 . very impressive . installation be simple . my previous card be a AMD hd4890 , and transition be smooth and easy . I simply remove the old driver , shutdown , replace the card , boot up , and install the new Nvidia driver . everything work as it should . be sure to get the latest driver from Nvidia 's website as the one on the disk that come with the card be not the latest .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	there be few manufacturer make they own version of hd 7970 , but I choose Sapphire HD 7970 OC . because it have big dual fan which be not only cool the card effectively but also very quiet . I be amaze how effective this cooling solution to the system . the other feature I like about , it have dual bio which be very good feature that you can lock in the highest clock speed . moreover , this card come with the complete accessory such as CrossFire connector , mini-dp to DVI dongle , hdmus to DVI adapter , mini-dp to dp cable , DVI to VGA adapter and 8-pin to 4-Pin Power cable . this card will stay in my system for quite a while until AMD introduce the new technology . I fully recommend this card to whom they be call as high-end gamer and Enthusiast . you will not regret .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this because I want to purchase rage and battlefield 3 and my current 5830 be not work with rage . I do get this thing work perfect with rage but I do have to shut off all my extra monitor and run rage with just one . this thing be powerful and nice but rage be just so demand . bf3 be not out yet but I believe it will work fine with that too .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Update 10\/14\/2011 . in the 2 week I have run my evga 590 I have have several people contact I via email on my profile with question . yes , it do show up in sisoft sandra as 2x580 's sli'e and not a 590 -lrb- at least my version of sandra - later version may learn to recognize the 590 card -rrb- . yes , I have run the 3dmark11 demo on the card and its goregeous , but no I will not make this a video review because that would mean cut the 16:9 down to amazon 's 4x3 format for review and super compress the datum to fit amazon 's video limit -lrb- the hd output file from my pro 3ccd camera be huge -rrb- until the quality of the original be go . I shoot the 32mark11 run 1920x1080 with a 1920x1080 camera carefully allign on axis of the monitor , exit the sound with fiber and go fiber to xlr into the camera 's line input for sound to produce a AVCHDPRO file of the demo . if you be serious about the card and want to really see the stunning hd video then please email I - I may convert the AVCHDPRO into AVCHD and then setup a download site on my server for the hd datum that you can watch in window media player at 1080x1920 , as it be mean to be view , with full stereo sound , but limit to people who have a system that warrant view hd , so please include you system config and I 'll reply with a download site \/ password if there be interest . there be 2 3dmark11 demo - the submarine and the jungle - with fulll lighting and smooth motion it be eye candy . -rrb- original review below : I buy my geforce 590 after upgrade a oem system which come with a geforce 2xx series to a geforce 480 now on craigslist with 1 year of use . I be amaze at the performance difference . the upgrade to the 590 have 3 time the memory , 1024 cuda core -lrb- essentially it be two gtx580 's SLI'ed in one card - it also need 4 ea slus power cable to run , along with a 850w p -rrb- . I do a lot of NLE video editing -lrb- hd 1080p\/1080i -rrb- and the 1024 cuda core really chew through hd video in a short time . the 590 be the BLEEDING edge , so there be some thing to keep in mind . first , you will need a power supply with 4 -lrb- four -rrb- of the normal 6 pin slus connector . the 590 come with two adapter - each take two 6 pin slus 's and make a 8 pin plug that fit one of the two 8 pin socket on the card . both socket must be fill for the card to work , so you will need 4 ea 6 pin slus 's or 2 ea 8 pin nvidium slus power cable to run the 3gb\/1024 processor graphic card . second , you will probably need to make a bio change . I lose my digital audio output - in fact I lose all audio output ! - basically you must go into bio setup and change the motherboard audio from `` auto '' which choose the dvi card to `` motherboard '' or just `` ON '' \/ `` default '' . my mobo be factory set to auto and once I switch it per the nvidium knowledgebase -lrb- very good btw -rrb- it find my optical audio output and headphones\/6 jack on the back . go from the 480 to the 590 also be a cleaner card . the fan on the 480 be smaller than the 590 . through the 590 's fan you can see the expensive japonese low-esr capacitor . it be basically a computer in and of itself . it will still require 2 slot - the \/ 16 slot along with the next card over for the fan , which be now in the middle of the card . on my 480 I get 3 monitor , however one use a micro hdmus , along with 2 dvi 's - on the 590 you can have 4 -lrb- yes four -rrb- monitor , and now they use the more robust mini-display-port instead of the micro hdmus which do not sag or bend the connector . get 4 monitor on a single card be pretty impressive -lrb- 3 dvi plus the minus display jack -rrb- . installation be easier with the 590 as there be no heatpipe extend above the card , as with the 480 . I will post a picture of both card on the static free foam - the 480 be in the foam and the 590 be remove from the foam with the larger fan . altogether , the 590 be simply the best graphic card -lrb- imho -rrb- on the market today . it be like have 2 580 's sli'e inside the same box . gamer will no doubt be thrill with its performance . note however that this review be for October 2011 . com soon to a store near you will be the evga nvidium 600 with performance and price exceed the 590 . Video and photographic user will find that the adobe cs5 package use the 1024 cuda core in such a way that the program be lightning fast . it be a very good investment in upgrade a old computer .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have do a lot with this card , play all sort of game bf3 , Skyrim , AvA , mw3 , Alan Wake , Saints Row 2 & 3 , and the list go on . all have be on the highest setting without the need to OC the card . it give a realistic look to Skyrim that it be almost sickening . I can not even describe the great detail within the game . be a serious gamer , I have not have the need to OC the card and not much heat really come from it -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- , but I have a lot of fan move a lot of cool air into my tower .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	the good news and bad news about this card : the good news - great card ! I buy it as the `` last best '' videocard for my agp motherboard - I take the advice on tom 's hardware and get this card . and it raise my performance hugely -lrb- my old video card be a 128mb geforce -rrb- , with no problem . it be a little tricky get the latest driver -lrb- best bet be to go to sapphire tech : -lrb- ... -rrb- -rrb- , but otherwise no problem . the bad news be - they do not really tell you -lrb- and the manual be also very cryptic about it -rrb- , but it turn out it need _ 2 _ 4-pin power supply connector feed into it . as my old video card need _ 0 _ such power supply connector , this be a issue : -rrb- . it be easily remedy by buy power supply splitter cable , which only cost about $ 4 -lrb- look at the ` people who buy this also buy ' section -rrb- , but if you do not order they in advance , and you be not near a Fry 's , you may have buy this video card and be unable to install it .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	after look at the review there be no way you can be disappoint with the evga gtx670 . First off , evga have great support , and the guy over at EVGA be great people . EVGA have be around for a very long time , and they even have they own forum where tech support help you out . as for the gtx670 performance be stellar despite the fact it be not as fast as a gtx680 , it 'll max out pretty much every game at 1080p without issue . after look at the review , it be a very impressive card . so not only be you get a great card , you be also get a top brand with a solid 3 year warranty , and solid support . evga from what I understand , also have a 90 day step up program , so if you want to upgrade within 90 day from the date of purchase to a newer product , you can through that program . people have also report that overclock the gtx670 can make it faster than a stock clock gtx680 . that be pretty impressive .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have get a three monitor setup -lrb- 2 x 23 '' lead and 1 x 47 '' lcd -rrb- . the 47 '' be power by this adapter . installation to use take about five minute , with very simple instruction . it do exactly what it say . highly recommend .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	extremely quiet even when the fan speed be high -lrb- compare to the 4870x2 it replace it be silent -rrb- . Easy installation and it handle all the game I own without break a sweat . I will give it a true test when Skyrim come down in price , but Diablo III do not even cause it to elevate setting and Arkham City at maximum with full dx11 effect only stutter once in 3 hour . my first Nvidia card and I be impressed . the OC software be simple to use and monitor temp and fan speed be easy to do . a little spendy , but warranty protection for a OC would card and the superior cooling be worth it . when the price drop I may likely add a second card in SLI mode .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	when I buy this , it be $ 165 , plus another $ 20 back in a mail-in rebate . for that amount of money , it be the best card you can buy . I have three monitor run a eyefinity display -lrb- one continuous display -rrb- to play Skyrim on three monitor , and I can play with the highest graphic setting without any lag . to install this card , I have to move my hard drive around so that the bay across from the pci-e port be open . this card be huge , but the cooling system be fantastic , and despite what some other review say , I can not hear the fan even on full unless I mute Skyrim . the install disc that come with the graphic card be corrupt , so I just download the software and driver from the Sapphire website . also , they do not tell you this , but you also get a free steam download of dirt 3 . it be 11gb , though , and I have not get to it yet ...
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	this video card be purchase to replace a older geforce 3 video card that be die that be use for s-video output . I be disappoint with the new GeForce 6200 over the lack of resolution performance . you would think that this would increase over the time between the 2 card be release .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	my friend show I he quad slus gtx295 in he new gaming computer . that be right ... four 1792mb graphic card ! let just say , `` Crysis on Maximum Qality '' be no problem ... even for Vista .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	just get this card for a new build . paired it with a Intel i3-2120 and it work great . this card be pretty big , so if you have a small case , you might want to get a newer one to handle how long it be . as for gaming performance it work very well . I be use it to play Batman : ac , Star Wars : The Old Republic , WoW , Portal 2 and Dirt 3 all on high . never a hiccup with fp , even under full load it never get very hot and the fan be super quiet . all and all if you look for a good GPU that will not break the bank like a 7970 , this be what you want . it be a much better value then the 6850 and should keep you rig go for a few year at acceptable graphic level . also would like to give a shout out to the people at Neogaf who help I put together this rig , thanks guy !
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	decent card , it can run game like wow close to ultra @ 30-60 fp . do not do so well with shadow or really scenery heavy game like FSX . it overclock well but I have find that it can be somewhat unstable -lrb- even when not overclock -rrb- . it be not very loud , 500 watt be all I need for the power supply , it come with 2 4 pin peripheral-6 pin converters\/extension cord . finally it be fairly big : it be as long as the motherboard and while it only need one pcie plug it will take up 2 pcus slot at the back of the computer . it sit up far enough from the motherboard to avoid hit the bio and stuff like that that might be sit around you card . do not know if I 'll ever get my rebate though and the Dirt 3 coupon have already be expire for half a month when I get it . so not the best service .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	pro : + can handle every game throw at it and still be able to run at a decent fp , even at stock . + able to have a stable overclock to 1250\/1450 . + nice and quiet . + come with lot of extra cable and adapter . con : - update version of Sapphire TrixX be not out yet so sometimes the OC for it glitch out . temp be around 26c at idle and around 48c at full load . do I have any buyer remorse with the keplar card come out ?? hell nah !! I be perfectly happy with the performance of this card !!
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	despite Amazon 's description above , this video card be not compatible with dvi-i connection . in several place on the outer packaging , it clearly state that this card be compatible with dvi-d , d-sub and hdmus , not dvi-i .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	product come with only a cd - no install insttruction . could not use CD until after the card be install and operate use the m driver that be initially install when new hardware be detect at bootup . my os be WXP . I be able to get the correct driver from the cd to load by the followig procedure : Control Panel\/System\/Hardware \/ deveice manager\/display adapters\/properties\/driver tab\/update driver\/select `` yes this time only '' , then Next\/select `` install from a list or specific locaton , next\/select `` search for the best driver in these location '' and check `` search removable media '' , have the cd in the CD drive and select the next button . this should start the CD ... follow the instruction on the screen .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I buy this card from Fry 's since the video card I have currently in my p4 be only 64 meg and can not play hidef video . after I install the card , window no longer boot . I try reseed the card , no luck , window still do not boot . I put the old video card back in , and window load normally . I try put the new video card in and again , after post run , nothing happen , window do not load , just a blinking cursor . I be go to return this card and try a different brand .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	48 hour and thus far work we great , very quite and cool . Intel mb , Azza case , i5 Processor . . Temp idel be in the low-mid 30 . use primarily for FSX .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	buy it not too long ago and have be run codmw3 on it . Works very well and have have no problem at all .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the video card be just what I need and I know the product before cause I have one once before and it be and still be play game 's with the grandson now ...
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the Sapphire Radeon HD Radeon 7870 OC be the perfect overall match . a Sapphire low power consumption , a modest oc , gaming max at 1920x1080 or lower , newest series and a amazing price . I have two small con , when run high end gaming the fan be medium noise level . note I be complain about medium fan noise not high . I run my NZXT full tower at low fan speed . when a high end game start run you can hear a boost in the GPU 's noise level . I have hear of game issue 's with the new 7000 series , but I have not run into any and from what I have hear they should all be patch in time . I would not be surprise if this GPU could run game on high at 2560x1600 and would definitely easily do it with crossfire . a lot of tech seem to underrate the performance of card . my Radeon 6770 run a native 1680x1050 , but it be able to handle 1920X1080 at high setting and catalyst overscan to make the display fit the screen , it could even run Ultra , but performance would take a small hit and I be sure it would have overheate with extend play if I have do so . my last complaint be catalyst do not have a power consumption section which be strange because my Radeon 6770 do . the real seller be the price 300 with oc . Main competition be gtx 570 superclock at 280 . twenty buck less , but big power consumption difference , probably longer , older model , worse performance . Radeon 7870 OC be better and ultimately cheaper . when add the cost of a higher cost psu and higher power bill you easily get you money back . very satisfied and will crossfire when the price drop even more .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	I choose to buy this one because of the 2bio setting and it can easily unlock the shader into 6970 . but it look like the new version -lrb- from first week of 2012 , the time i bring it -rrb- can not , no matter i flash it myself or use the magic switch on the card . CAN NOT UNLOCK the shader . I get the replacement , same issue happend there . if you want to buy one with the really unlock shader , find a use one maybe a good choice . I look some of the review on the Newegg , same issue happend . the new sapphire dirt 3 edition can not unlock shader anymore .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	my old graphic card be shoot , replace it with visiontek ATI Radeon HD Graphics Card . the first one I receive from Amazon do not work . I call Visiontek at first thinking I screw up the installation -lrb- it be very simple to install -rrb- they rep. tell I the new card be shoot . contact Amazon and they replace it next day mail and it be all good . the fan be a bit noisy at start up , but quiet down after a few minute .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I do a lot of research before decide on this card . the main thing that make I decide to buy it be ; 1 . high quality component . this card be not a cheap version of a 6950 , it be a solid card with japanese make capacitor -lrb- the best -rrb- and great construction . 2 . quiet ! this card be 100 % quieter than my last card , a 4890 . my wife love it that my computer can not be hear in the other room now ! 3 . cool ! this card run extremely cool . the two fan configuration do a excellent job keep it cool -lrb- and be also the reason it be so quiet , the fan can run at a lower rpm and still provide more cooling than a single fan -rrb- . 4 . fast fast fast . this card , while not a reference design -lrb- for unlock shader -rrb- be still a very fast card . it blow away every game I throw at it , and I can finally run crysis at max setting ! one thing to remember about reference vs. non-reference card be that when you unlock the shader , you only get a 3 % performance boost , and that be at the cost of a hotter running and louder card -lrb- due to the single fan -rrb- . bottom line , if you be look for a great clard that be fast , quiet , cool , and have some overclockability , this be the one to get .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this so that I could install  Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate  Sparkle Graphics card be do the job . very happy with it .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this be a review for the rebate portion of the card . if you be not interested , then do not read . however , I be post this because I feel it be pertinent information , and for I , it be what determine my get this card from this manufacturer . long story short , they have provide completely conflict information on the process of the rebate , and will do whatever it take to make sure that you will never get you rebate in the window that they originally advertise . here be the documentation of my experience : on Thu , Jun 21 , 2012 at 6:55 pm ,  write : -rrb- Dear xxxxxx , -rrb- -rrb- we be pleased to inform you that you rebate , with the basic service -rrb- level you select have be process and approve on 06\/21\/2012 . -rrb- -rrb- you Amex  reward card will be mail within 8-10 week . please contact -rrb- we if you have any additional question . -rrb- -rrb- Below be the summary of you rebate registration information : -rrb- -rrb- track Number : xxxxxxxx -rrb- rebate offer : Sapphire special mail-in rebate -rrb- rebate Item : Sapphire Radeon hd6950 2g ddr5 pcie -rrb- rebate Item UPC number -lrb- s -rrb- : xxxxxxxx -rrb- rebate award : $ 20.00 -rrb- Service level Basic : $ 0.00 -rrb- final award : $ 20.00 so , 8-10 week go back from 6\/21\/12 . nothing happen . the tracking number they give I do not work , either . I send they another email : ----- original message ----- sent : sep 1 , 2012 2:38:14 PM Subject : Re : Rebate Processed Hi , just wonder where be my rebate card . I still have not receive it . the tracking number you give I do not work . all the claim history , accord to you website , say be : \* Claim Status history \* ------------------------------ Date Status comment 5\/19\/2012 5:22:10 AM Claim create 5\/19\/2012 5:23:28 AM Claim Completed , Awaiting Receipt of Documentation 6\/14\/2012 1:54:40 PM Documentation receive 6\/21\/2012 9:54:55 PM Claim be approve it should have be here within 8-10 week . can you please provide I a status update ? ---------------------------------- it take I another email and another week before I finally get a response -lrb- they advertise that they always respond within 2 business day , because customer service be `` very important '' to they -rrb- . here be the most recent email : on frus , sep 7 , 2012 at 6:46 AM , 4myrebatesapphire  write : thanks for you email . customer satisfaction be very important to we and as such , we will respond to you email , answer any and all question within the next 2 business day exclude weekend . hello . you rebate have be approve as of `` 09\/01\/12 '' . it take 8-10 week from the date of approval for the rebate payment to be issue and send out . ------------------------------------------------- wow , really ? another 8-10 week after 9\/1\/12 ? what about they website and email from they , say my claim be approve back in 6\/21\/12 and that the card would be issue within 8-10 week from 6\/21\/12 ? complete and blatant lie . they clearly have zero intention of mailing I anything , hope that I would probably forget , and they could scam I and countless other out of a rebate that be owe to we , as what they advertise . they be also base in Hong Kong , make it more complicate when pursue legal action ... which i be sure they be fully aware of . just relay my own personal experience , hope to let everyone be aware of what they may encounter . I hope everyone be able to get they rebate and for I , it be just a fluke , but I think they response show they do not take customer service very seriously at all .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I buy this for my boyfriend & he love it , when it arrive he could not wait to install it into he computer . once he do he love it . once it be in he computer the graphic & game in he system work alit better . definatly worth the money & better yet the look on he face .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this accessory have boost my productivity significantly , I purchase the DVI connector as I think it would be faster . I have no complaint whatsoever . I call for support for something I could have fix myself -lrb- reinstall the driver -rrb- and they be very fast to answer . I be use 2 large 1920 by 1200 with a small laptop and my life will never be the same , I be now get one for home , so I can work consistently at home and work ! loving this device , a small cost for a large gain of productivity ! I buy one for everyone in we company who want it !
GraphicsCard	POS	4	Easy to install and Windows xp configure the card . update the driver and good to go . the price be right for my new hd monitor . I be not a gamer or movie watcher on my pc .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I go online and fill out the rebate form but while you be fill out the rebate , there be no where that say the address have to match the billing until you go to print out the last page -lrb- which you normally assume be correct -rrb- . I send the rebate in right away , and it show that they receive it but they do not send I a email regard the rejection until the last day that I be able to resubmit . also , the reason state that the invoice\/packing slip be invalid and not that the address do not match . obviously I didnt get my rebate and all I get be rude service .

GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I buy this card as a upgrade to my Sapphire hd5750 . this card be well build , not flashy and very powerful ! it install fairly easily , although I have to move my hard drive to a different slot in my case as this card span the entire inside of my Antec 900 case . the performance be amazing . battlefield 3 run at 80 + fp on Ultra @ 1280x1024 . on high\/ultra hybrid I be get 120 + fp . last night I notice some choppiness while play . I exit my game to try and free up some resource and start get artifact -lrb- video error -rrb- on my screen . my display freeze , go blank and then return say the driver crash and be recover . it loop this way forever . I have do everything software wise to fix this , and I believe it be a corrupt memory issue on the card , but I can not confirm this . I have do no modification , over clock etc. to any of my hardware . the GPU sit at a comfortable 45-48c and never have fan issue . see the video below for the artifacting . I check a `` Egg Themed '' online retailer and find that there be 7 of 127 review that be negative . almost all of they seem to have the same freezing artifact issue , so it do not appear to be a fluke . all this be say , I be still go to get this card . I will send this back -lrb- Amazon service have be great !!! -rrb- and get another and cross my finger . again , this card be AWSOME , when it work .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	the card itself be outstanding . the performance really be second to none . 2560x1600 and no issue here on any of the current game like bf3 . would love to get 2 of these in slus . evga support also rock as well . the customer service be top notch , speak to two rep already on some installation issue and they be really helpful and nice to talk to . you really can not go wrong with evga and I probably would not bother with other brand myself . not say there be not other good brand but I prefer evga . I think the price be pretty fair because of the performance but you can always hope it will go down in price . this be the top perform graphic card out there right now , so consider that , it command a premium price .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I get my evga 560 TI 448 in earlier today and just get finish install it . it replace a EVGA gtx 280 . I uninstall the nVidia driver , reboot to safe mode and run DriverCleaner . reboot to Windows 7 and d\/l ` ed the 266.66 and the 285.62 to test which be better . I begin to install the 285.62 and it could not find a support device , same with the 266.66 . sooo , I actually resort to use the CD setup and it work like a charm . I be get a 24.8 fp avg in Unigen Heaven with the 280 on dx10 with a score of 625 . I run the same setting with the 560 and hit 40.8 fp avg with a score of 1029 . I have not touch the clock yet so I can not comment on the O.C. I usually do not O.C. my video card anyway . my system be a e8500@4ghz run 4gig of ddr2 ocz reaper @ 800mhz . not sure if it be bottleneck yet . evga be great with a replacement I have about 3 year ago so I feel confident in the selection . I be still not certain if the price increase be worth it for the extra core and memory , but we will see .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	run Battlefield 3 on Ultra at 40-45fp and with frap run at 35-40fp . should have get 2 and run they in Crossfire but this be a budget build and I be 100 % satisfied with the result .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I need a bigger , faster card for my son 's pc so he could play Lego Universe -lrb- which be a Christmas present this year -rrb- . this card be list on they sy req page . plug it in , and this card put the old 128mb power color to shame . great speed , great graphic , better quality graphic and speed for the game he already play . great deal for my 7yr old son 's computer .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	first thing that hit I be that this thing be enormous ! I have have 2 slot video card before but this one feel so much bigger . the heat sink be outrageously large . ca not say anything else yet . I have to figure out how to fit this into the tight space in my pc ... Update : just so happen that my old video card -lrb- 8800gt -rrb- die from overheate , so I have no choice but take my pc apart to fit this monster in . so far so good ! Works as expect . big improvement over the old card in both performance score and the card be roughly 20f cooler than the old one .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this card as a replacement for 128 meg card that be begin to humm and buzz . the new card work with no problem , but the thing that surprise I be that it noticeably speed up other application that I run constantly . the control panel provide with it be also very nice .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be great ! it be easy to overclock and have never reach a temp of over 60c when play battlefield 3 on ultra graphic setting . would highly recommend for any gamer .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	do not get this product . it mess up all the software that be on my computer . also it could not even do a simple power point presentation .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card its magnificent , it can run every posible game at this moment without problem . Asus do a great job with the package of the card , really good look . apart from that this its just like any other 680 reference card in the market , with 3 year warranty . the one i have its from a good batch , it overclock really well -lrb- core : 1300 \/ memory : 6800 -rrb-
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I be turn my old computer into a dvr -lrb- use Windows 7 Media Center -rrb- , and be unable to use the on board graphic to get over the Air hd channel in . I purchase this to fix that problem , and it do beyond belief !!!! I install this in a Dell Dimension 3000 , with Intel Pentium 4 -lrb- 2.8 ghz -rrb- with 1.5 gb of RAM , run Windows 7 Professional x86 . the Dell Dimension 3000 only have pcus slot , so I be limit to what I can use , most newer card be pci-express , so find a pcus card , that be any good be tough . I then come to this product . with 512mb of memory and a pcus connection this be a great choice ! I open up the computer and plug this card into a available PCI slot -lrb- the heat sink on the card be large , so you may need to put it away from other card -rrb- , and turn on the computer . straight from boot the computer could use this pcus card and have no problem use VGA . Windows detect it and I install the software -lrb- I do not use the CD , instead I download the latest software from NVIDIA 's website -rrb- . I reboot the computer and be look at great graphic with super fast performance ! I plug in a hdmus cable go to my tv and it switch over with no problem , so now I have Video and Sound go through the HDMI cable from this card !!!! I have test the computer by view video from my tv tuner -lrb- over the Air HD programming -rrb- and have no problem . all the video that would not play before -lrb- like Media Center DVR content play perfectly -rrb- and they be no shutter or video problem ! when I run the Windows experience here be my result : Processor : 3.7 memory : 4.1 graphic : 4.2 gaming graphic : 4.5 -lrb- amazing improvement !!! -rrb- primary hdd : 4.1 the result before the new card be install -lrb- Intel Integrated Graphics -rrb- : Processor : 3.7 memory : 4.1 graphic : 1.9 gaming graphic : 1.0 primary hdd : 4.1 in the end this be a great video card for any computer not just older computer -lrb- although a more powerful one might be need for gaming -rrb- . I be extremely happy with this card , from the easy installation and driver from NVIDIA to the hdmus output to my tv , it be great !!! I highly recommend for anyone look to speed up a older computer . I be use this computer as a dvr use Windows Media Center for watch tv and recording . here be the spec of my system to help anyone out : Dell Dimension 3000 Original Motherboard Intel Pentium 4 , 2.8 ghz 1.5 gb of memory -lrb- 1024 + 512 mb chip -rrb- Windows 7 Professional , 32 bit for the price and feature this card can not be beat !!! I highly recommend it !!!!
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this piece of junk work once , after reboot I have no display . I reinstall my old card and it work fine . DO NOT BUY !!!!!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have no issue unlock to the 6970 bio . this card have a switch to select which bio you want to use . you do not need to flash the bio on the card . you do need to completely remove all amd\/ati graphic driver before move the switch to 6970 , then re-install the driver clean . card run cool 99f to 104f idle , to 152f under severe load and overclock . I be use Sapphire TriXX to OC to 880 and 1375 -lrb- stable and cool -rrb- and it moderately raise the temperature and fan speed . I easily push it to 900\/1400 -lrb- stable but higher temp -rrb- with a voltage increase . I be extremely happy with this purchase .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	buy the card to replace 2 gtx 460 's in SLI . mainly for the increase VRAM . my 460 's be the dumb down model that only have 768mb of VRAM . which really be not enough to game at 1080p on a 1920x1080 resolution . I notice performance hit in a lot of high end game graphic wise like Crysis , Metro 2033 and even skyrim with mod install . stutter be common in large open environment and it be a pain in the ass to deal with . the 448 core fix all of these problem . no more stuttering in large open environment and I can max graphical setting without any hitch . to my surprise the 448 core be actually faster stock then my 460 's be overclock . maybe it be just my system , but most review show slus 460 's beat a single 448 core\/570 and just a hair below a gtx 580 in term of performance . overclock can fix that too since the 448 core be a great overclocker . my motherboard be a huge bottleneck for my entire system be a old am2 board but even then I have be able to push this 448 core to 880mhz stable @ 1.075 v so far . this be usually achievable with lower voltage for most people . so I 'll probably be lucky to hit 900mhz at 1.1 v. but even then the performance increase from 80mhz be noticable . the card run cool with a tweaked fan profile I have set in MSI Afterburner . it idle at around 30c and load around 68-70c while gaming . for the price I get this card at it be definitely worth it consider I 'll probably be able to turn around and sell my 460 's for a equal cost . mean this card practically cost I nothing . if you can get a 448 core for $ 220 or less then jump on it . people argue that the gtx 480 be a better deal but the card be on a older fab that run way hotter . that be the main issue I have with the gtx 480 be the amount of heat it put out and that it consume more power . another nice thing about this version of the 448 be how small the card actually be . this one be only 9 inch long . a few other like the Classified or Ultra model be 10.5 in so that may be something to consider if it be a tight space in you case . a few thing to remember if you be think about buy this card be that this will not sli with anything BUT another 448 core . a regular 560 or 560 ti will not do . so if you plan on go SLI in the future remember also that this card be a limited edition so it be probably go to stop sell soon and become hard to find . so get 2 right off the bat . another thing , if you use benchmark like Furmark or OCCT the 500 series Nvidia card have a build in power protection that automatically downclock the card to keep it within power draw specification . I find this out after run occt and think my overclock be stable . boy be I wrong and disappointed . you will have to stress stability the old fashion way of hardcore gaming and look for artifacts\/waiting for the game to crash and you driver to reload , lol .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I replace a Radeon 92oo with this card for more mb of memory , wrong move . this card just freeze after booting-up . Tech support send I to they web-site to fix the problem , but the graphic freeze before a fix could be downlode . Poped the Radeon back in and all be great . I be go to buy a radeon instead . guess i get burn by get this card from Amazon , because now I have to keep it . Stay away from this card !!!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	ever since I switch from a desktop to a laptop , one of my two desktop monitor be leave unused as the laptop 's graphic card could only connect to one of they at a time . this be a acceptable scenario , as I could just use the laptop 's screen as the second monitor in the setup . however , as time go on , I want to do something with my unused desktop monitor , and I find this device . it will not work without the proper driver , which come in a cd . because my laptop do not have a CD drive , I quickly find the driver on the StarTech.com website -lrb- easy to find driver -- another bonus ! -rrb- . as soon as I install they and plug in the device , my unused monitor spring to life for the first time in month . the image quality be great , but not perfect . I occasionally see wavy line on the monitor connect by the device , but these line be only visible when I be try to find something wrong with the display . plus , base on what I have read , mild image issue like that be to be expect and be likely a limitation of usb external graphic card . finally , the price of this adapter be great compare to other offer similar resolution . I would recommend this device to anybody .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	just get this card in the mail last night . I have my hd 5850 Overclocked to 900Mhz and i still could only play bf3 at medium to low setting with a average of 20-40fp . this card right out of the box hold 60 + fp on Ultra setting with 4x msaa at 1080p on my 42 '' 120hrz hdtv -lrb- my monitor -rrb- . I overclock it to 1.3 Ghz in less than 20minute with no previous know how of precision X. memory at 3.5 Ghz as well . you must set a custom fan profile if you want the card to stay under 70c -lrb- which it must or the card will throttle its self and you will loose you GPU boost preset -rrb- . mine average 65-68c with 85 % fan . it blow hot air out the back like a space heater but its a cool run card compare to gtx 580\/590 ect . its a bit loud compare to my system that run nearly silent . my rig a half 922 with Intel i2600k at 5ghz . with overclock i get 85-130fp in bf3 . amazing card . I have order a ASUS 7970 direct CU II TOP previously that be DOA ! this be before the gtx 680 be release . im glad that card be DOA actually because this card be amazing . I also can honestly say the driver for this card be next to non . I know every one say that AMD driver be not that great but im here to personally say that they be far inferior compare to Nvidia ... sad because i love AMD and just upgrade from a CRosshair Formula 4 \/ Phenom x6 1090t that now sit on my shelf along with my AMD video card . im off track but my old rig be good BUTTT my new rig smoke my old one hand down and be worth the $ and then some . great card and i recomend it to any one who have that cash . I be think i might have to slus this card with another gtx 680 but this card overclock so well i wont have to in the near or far future . without a overclock it still tear whole through ULTRA set on all game . cheer and let the head shot begin !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have a HP a250n pentium 4ht 2.60 mhz with 1gb RAM run Windows 7 . I have be think about buy a new pc , but figure it would be WAY cheaper to just upgrade my video card . after search around for agp4x\/8x video card , I find that the hd3850 get the most praise out of the other 512mb card , so I decide to give it a shot . as soon as I take the hd3850 out of the box , I new I be in for something awesome . when I switch out my NVIDIA geforce5200 128mb card to the hd 3850 , the fp on doom 3 sky rocket ... not to mention overall pc performance . also , Fallout 3 and leave 4 dead run a smooth 30fp at 1024x768 . this card give new life to my pc . dual DVI , S-Video , dual monitor support ... but no 1080p . only thing be that you have to get a 450w or greater power supply with 30amp on 12 volt with 2x4 power connector recommend . if you be look into get one of these , you might want to do some research before it arrive at you doorstep , so that you have everything you need to install it and have it up and run in no time without any issue .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	we use these for computer that do not come with native dual-monitor video output and they work very well . they be inexpensive and when deal with a wide range of computer form factor and hardware , they portability to any usb-enabled computer be a huge plus .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	let first start off with what system I have . I have this HP DC5100 small form factor computer with pentium 4 3 GHz HT processor , 3 gb ram , and 40 gig hardrive . I recently install Windows Vista Ultimate which run good on it except for the on board video which would not let I run the Windows Aero and some other program like Windows dvd maker . I figure I would upgrade the video card for when my daughter would visit so they would have a decent computer to use . the video card install with no problem as long as you follow the instruction like disable the on board video first in bio and then install the card and then install the new driver in safe mode . the card do come with small profile kit so I can not understand why Amazon have a small profile kit that it tell you to buy with it . well , I waist my money on that ! well , not to much because the kit be only $ 6.95 well all and all the card work good with what I need . I would recommend the card if all you be look for be just run Windows Vista . I be not sure how it work for gaming because I be not in to that note : I run the base score again and it raise my score from a 1.9 to a 2.6 which be a shock . I think it would of be higher because the only thing I be lack be a video card from what it tell I . Windows Aero 2.6 and 3d business and gaming graphic be 3.9
GraphicsCard	POS	5	buy this card a few day ago and it be work flawlessly . I replace a two year old Sapphire Radeon hd4870 which could not handle dx11 game to my liking . this card have exceed my expectation so far . couple quick tip when do any card installation . download the latest driver for you new card prior to uninstall the old card . I then remove my old driver prior to install the new card . I also remove any special software the old card come with . put the new card in , clean out the case while I as at it , and boot up . install the new driver , restart , and be good to go .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I install the driver and when my computer restart I get black screen on my laptop . I have to restart and go to safe mode in order to uninstall the driver , so I could get my display back . I try to do it twice , and get the same result , so give up and return it .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	originally , I buy the MSI 7970 Lightning because of the legendary performance that usually come with the lightning product line . unfortunately , I be only able to overclock the card to 1170 on the core and 1500 on the VRAM . this be in line with the experience that reviewer related , but it be a bit disappointing . in addition , the lightning that I have would occasionally lock up , even when it be not overclock . for six Benjamins , I be not go to put up with that , so I send it back . after scour the review , I decide that I would get a gtx 680 , even though I be uncomfortable with the 2 gb of VRAM -lrb- I game at 2560x1600 -rrb- . the reason I be a little doubtful be that when I track VRAM usage in skyrim with all my hd mod , I frequently utilize all of the 3 gb of VRAM on the 7970 . despite these misgiving , I settle down to wait for a gtx 680 to pop up . then I have a chance to get a Sapphire Dual-X 7970 OC for four hundred thirty dollar . I have read good review on the Sapphire 7970 , and be impress with the overclock that reviewer be able to get on they . I decide to take a chance on the Sapphire over the gtx 680 , since it be nearly a hundred less than what I could get a 680 for . so far , I be very glad I take the plunge . the oc I be get on the card I get be amazing ! I can play Skyrim at 1270 on the core and 1700 on the VRAM -lrb- at 1.2 volt -rrb- with no problem . and I have not even push it to the max yet to see how high I can go ! at these speed , I think I be get better performance than a overclocked gtx 680 would provide . to top it off , the Sapphire cooler be both quieter and cooler than the MSI lightning cooler . Max temp with my MSI be about 70 c in game , but I have not ever hit above 65 c with my Sapphire yet . the only two issue I see be a potential problem be a slight coil whine when I abuse the card in Furmark -lrb- no sound at all during gaming , though -rrb- , and the fact that the 7970 will not wake up after the computer go to sleep . I have to reboot it . however , that be a problem with all 7970s it seem , since my msus do it too , and I have read that a lot of other people have the same problem . the other sticking point for I be Sapphire 's warranty . sure , 3 year be good , but several manufacture be do the warranty by serial number instead of have it stick with the purchaser . this could be a problem if you ever want to sell the card in the future . if Sapphire do they warranty by serial number , like some of they competition , that would be a huge boost in they favor . in short , if you want a fantastic video card for a great price , look no further . get it !
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	I first install this card use Windows 2000 pro , and it work very well . then I do a new install of Windows 7 , and now many program include Combat Flifht Simulator will not run at all - even after get the win7 driver from Nvidia .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	I buy this video card to give I Aero capability on a old HP desktop -lrb- 2004 model -rrb- for a Windows 7 upgrade . the video work great . the only problem I have encounter be my pc will not wake up from sleep mode . I do contact evga for support and they be responsive but could not fix the problem -lrb- it be a old computer with old bio -rrb- . for the money it have save I from a computer upgrade for another year or two so it be worth it .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this product could not be install without the 6-prong power adapter-not included\/not sell at Radio Shack or best buy \/ no way to use the product without have it professionally install because no one else sell the cable . a waste of my time and my money .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I install Richard burn rally game but would not play on my old Dimension 4600 due to lack of pixel shading . plug unit in and voila all be well . shredding rbr on the daily now . thanks evga and Amazon
GraphicsCard	POS	4	this video card perform great !!! too bad my corsair caviar green hdd be too slow , because this video card can play max on bf3 and mw3 no problem . the lag be the result of my hdd , but I be upgrade to corsair force ssd soon . this be a great video card . very large , though . take up the slot adjacent to it on the motherboard .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	pro : - inexpensive htpc card . - have win7 driver -lrb- though might be rough install -rrb- . - have a HDMI Port . - claim to be support . - come in a small box . con : go from Aero Windows experience index of 4.1 to that of 3.7 when swap in this card . the previous card be a 3 + year old atus x1300 . how be that possible ? driver install require patience , and a few crash . suggest buy NVidia . other thought : bought hd4350card to replace a still good htpc graphic card that ATI no longer support under Windows 7 : be run a Dell P-Duo as a htpc for more than a few year , just fine , with a ATI x1300 graphic card . upgrade to Windows 7 for 7MC , and start have video source switching issue , fix require a new Video card . ATI decide stop support a old product , fine . but the new product benchmark -lrb- artifical or not -rrb- worse ? three year later ?!? ridiculous . ati\/amd have alienate yet another customer .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	have no issue with delivery , installation and operation . even have some documentation , which i do not have to use . hardware : HP ACPI x86 base desktop , model nr a6250z . replacement for original ge force after it bite the dust . like large heat sink , no fan - no noise , less power consumption . Make sure to install driver .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	this product be easy to install on my computer . it enhance the video capibility by 100 % on my Dell Dimension 4600 that be purchase in mid-2004 .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the onboard graphic card on my old Dell Dimension e521 have only a VGA graphic port . when I decide to set up dual display -lrb- a monitor and a projector -rrb- , I go with this graphic card , which will support dual -lrb- possibly three monitor -rrb- monitor . its low price -lrb- 35 when I buy it -rrb- and the positive review be what clinch it for I . the installation of the card be easy . I simply insert it in the PCI slot of the computer , hook up the cable , fire up the computer , install the driver on the CD -- and it be work . I be also pleasantly surprise that it improve performance on my Photoshop CS5 very noticeably . dual Monitor support -------------------- this card have 3 graphic port : hdmus , DVI , and VGA . so , you could conceivably set up 3 monitor with it . I use the DVI connection for my monitor and the VGA on my projector -lrb- which have neither DVI or HDMI connector -rrb- . with the VGA connection I do run into a problem with `` ghost '' on my projector display . as a workaround , I run a hdmus cable from the HDMI port to a `` hdmus to VGA Converter , '' and a VGA cable from the `` hdmus to VGA Converter '' to my projector -- this setup solve the ghost problem ! improve Graphics Performance ----------------------------- one app that I use very often be Photoshop -lrb- cs5 -rrb- . however , it be always be very sluggish on my computer . one particular problem that irk I be I when I press and hold down the space bar to temporarily use the hand tool , the image would not pan or if it do , it be choppy and excruciatingly slow . after I install this graphic card , the problem be go . Photoshop be now very responsive and much faster than before . -- if you want to set up dual monitor or if you have a onboard graphic card and want improved graphic performance , the ASUS GeForce 8400GS card be a good bet . be aware of the potential VGA ghost problem with dual Monitor setup however . apart from the VGA ghost problem -lrb- which I find a workaround for -rrb- , I be immensely please with this graphic card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I spend all day on the computer at work and at home , usually with several window open for reference on the same project . my laptop -lrb- Dell e5410 -rrb- only support two monitor through its built-in graphic card and I want a third to avoid all the window switching I do now . I receive the adapter , download and install the latest driver from Startech -lrb- as explain in the package -rrb- , I plugged-in the adapter and connect the cable . 5 or less minute later I have 2048x180 on 3rd monitor . no problem with performance or app error , seem very stable .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this to use in conjunction with a Ivy Bridge processor 's integrated graphic so I could run 3 monitor without have to use DisplayPort . it seem that 2 DVI port on a graphic card be rare , this be one of the only one I find . I have 1 monitor run through HDMI off the Ivy Bridge 's graphic , and the other 2 monitor off the 2 DVI port on this card , and after a little tweaking in the bio etc. it work like a charm . I do not use it too heavily , no game or anything , but it be simple and painless and work great , so I be quite happy . the only thing that be not great be the rebate process - I hate these , they try to make it so difficult to get the rebate I guess hope you will give up and not go for it . just make the thing cheaper instead ! but they say my check be come in 6-8 week , so I guess I penetrate the bureaucracy !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	after purchase and install this in my rig , it have outperform all my expectation . Run SWTOR on max setting beautifully . play game like Crysis 2 , Dead Space 2 , Far Cry have all be flawless . battlefield 3 be almost all on max setting . mw3 max out . wow play fantastic but its not a GPU heavy game but still make it look very nice . get a strong 7.8 Windows score . install afterburner and have it now tune and stable at over 1000mhz . most of it be do without any voltage tweak whatsoever . I think it be stable at 1040 with no voltage as I stress test it with Crysis and Crysis 2 . after 3-4 hour on Crysis it show sign of artifact . I back the clock down to 1020 and its be stable since then . after I voltage adjust it , I could maintain 1040 with no issue . have not go higher as it work great for the game I play . great card with enormous OC potential . stay cool even at OC would spec . Heatsinks and the copper pipe dissipate the heat very well .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this install in a 8 year old pa computer with no problem . the driver and control program work as they should and it adjusted my VGA monitor for the best picture image for my 3 year old monitor . I want to try it with hdmus as money permit .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	for $ 56 it would be worth it . for $ 99.99 , not so much . any computer that have only PCI slot probably only have a single core processor so this card will help , but not dramatically . I be use the computer for a secondary character with wizard101 . the page still take time to load but the movement be smoother .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card be so efficient , it handle everything i play . it be my first Nvidia card , except the gtx 560m in my g 74 gaming laptop . ive have a 6870 , 7870 and now this one , its like I do not have to worry about any hiccup or tear etc. ... I be definetly sell with Nvidia and its be hard to come to this and I do not know why ? maybe b\/c I always cheer for the underdog ? LOL whatever but I have nothing negative to say about my 680 , expcept that I only have one and not two ! my 7870 be a good card but I can not see pass up a 670 for a 7870 ? these new card be awesome , totally awesome and if you want to go with 3d , do not even consider amd . I do and let I tell you the compatablity stink ! not with Nvidia though ... I can state the driver be better all that stuff but I ` de sound like a broken record , go with this card and I promise you 'll not be dissapoint in the least bit
GraphicsCard	POS	5	one word : AMAZING !!! this card be really quiet and run fairly cool even under load . so far very impressed with the performance as well . I be go to buy a slightly cheaper model but I do not regret pay a little more for this one . Crysis , what use to be the bane of even high end setup , can be easily max out at 1920x1200 . benchmark for current game also look great . Have have zero problem with the card so far . installation be very easy and hassle free . the only thing to keep in mind be that it be very long -lrb- 9.8 '' or 250mm -rrb- , so make sure you have the clearance .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have a Zotac gtx 680 reference card before which would not overclock no matter what I do , I sell that card to buy a gtx 690 but come to my sens and decide I dont game enough to justify 1000 dollar on a video card . so I serach reveiw look for best gtx 670\/680 again which would be good overclocker and this one fit the bill perfectly . I would get ASUS gtx 680 dc2 but stock on those be even worse than this card , plus its a three slot design versus this which be only a two slot a plus in my book . so the performance with boost of this card be slightly faster than reference gtx 680 in game but gtx 680 score a bit higher on 3dmarks11 at least in my case . but real world performace be identical . even compare a gtx 670 overclocked to a gtx 680 overclocked performace be always very close that why I didnt mind my `` downgrade '' from gtx 680 to gtx 670 . all in all this be best gtx 670 ATM , if you get a stable one . now go on buy one .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	when I receive this video card , I have it install immediately . I be happy with the result of my resolution . everything fall into place . my computer be work great . I be also very pleased with the price .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I read many review before I pick the Visiontek ATI Radeon HD 4350 graphic card . my old HP media center 7167 have graphic chip on the motherboard and it be not up to widescreen or anything else . I buy a new 27 inch monitor and I need a basic upgrade to make use of all that new screen real estate . the card be easy to install it be quickly pick up by the old xp media center and I be off and run . I work heavily with photograph and standard screen video editing . this card work great for that , I do not game on my computer so I do not know how well it work for that , the review say moderate gaming be ok . so far great .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	first off I be use this with : i7 2600k @ 3.8 16 gig of RAM at 1600mhz 850 Watt PSU my performance in game use EVGA precision x monitoring . keep in mind these number be WITHOUT OC . with modest oc expect a 5-10 fp increase . Witcher 2 : all setting max , ubersample off - average of 60 fp . gorgeous . all setting max , ubersample on 30-50 fp . still very playable . recommend OC to increase the frame provide you want ubersample on -lrb- not a noticeable difference honestly to I -rrb- Metro 2033 : average of 40-60 fp . probably the card 's weakest performance . frame sit at about 50 , in some area it can dip below 40 . keep in mind this be everything max -lrb- aside from AAA , and 16x -rrb- . battlefield 3 : Everything max , vertical sync disabled . Multiplayer be at about average of 70 fp . some area of campaign can vary between 45-70 . very solid performance . this game heat up my 680 to about 79c , no other game take it that hot . Crysis 2 : all setting max , vertical sync disabled 45-70 fp depend on how many explosion and wide the environment be . some of the battle location in Crysis 2 be large and require lot of memory . can notice a slight decline in smooth gameplay . very demand game , give good performance . to play this game I recommend to OC . diablo 3 : this be a driver issue im about 80 % sure , all setting max ofc -lrb- not a demand game at all -rrb- yet when I first start play the game horrible stuttering and lag for about a couple minute . seem as if it need time to catch up to the normal 60 fp I get after the initial intense lag . weird . conclusion : Stock performance be respectable . OC recommend . Mine just so happen to oc alright . Make sure to disable vertical sync as this be hinder my 680 's performance greatly until I figure out i need to disable it -lrb- duh -rrb- . do not feel the need to overclock my CPU to 4.7 like I do before . 3.8 be fine . Hope this help . Feel free to ask question .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I can finally get some serious acceleration in after effect cs6 with the GPU CUDA Mercury Engine on Mac , with technically a unsupported card . I be try to get it to work with vray 2.0 for maya 2013 at the moment -lrb- gpu\/rt -rrb- to no avail , but Cinema 4D 's physical render in insanely fast .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	First of all , I be not sure why anyone would buy the normal gtx 580 when this one be the same price !! anyway that be really not important , what be important be that this card be awesome . I basically purchase this so I could play skyrim on ultra and it have far exceed my expectation . I be actually play the game now with the skyrim hd mod that have even higher resolution texture and there be still no slow down . I be come from a gtx 285 and I do not think I would need to upgrade for a loong time but I guess that time have come sooner than expect . basically , if you be wonder if this card be worth the price tag , yes it be .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	bad to the bone , badder then bad ... will blow u away . . note : both power connecter need to be power up . . this barbarian rate 7.8 on window experience rating
GraphicsCard	POS	5	nice so far . replace a 128 mb 32-bit card . card work great in a all NVIDIA system , MSI mobo with a triple-core AMD processor , 64-bit xp and 6 gb RAM . the color be incredible in comparison . be play AOE Online and the color just jump out now . the game also take less than half the time to boot up . old video card need replace . note that this card do not have a fan . load this chassis down with fan at build so cooling be not a big issue . have not really have a chance to look at the specifics of the card , run temp or how it be affect the temp of processor . will review runtime performance and edit this if warrant . Works great after two day . hopefully I 'll be sing the same song two year from now .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	i buy this card as upgrade for xp sp3 . needless to say issue after insert into system , -lrb- agp -rrb- card . with the card , pc will hang in safe mode , and if a older system -lrb- mine gigabyte with nvidium chip -rrb- nvdium \/ evga driver will reprogram you mcp and break on board audio for good . Make sure to uninstall high fidelity audio driver . I go round and round on this try to fix both issue . I read with latest driver -lrb- nvidium -rrb- it break the audio in favor of the reprogram . apparently not enough space . anyway many experience these same issue without fix . my best solution be to buy a pcus sound card for like $ 9 -lrb- startech -rrb- and install they driver over the top . now all sound work again . evga support post be worthless . consider stick with previous version of evga . nvidium driver set for you own good . get better resultion when run the nvdium utility . not a bad card , but i be still stump over the hand in safe mode . I
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this card suck . sorry to be blunt but it do the driver mess up on I 4 time i blow 2 card it black screen on any 3d app and during driver update it freeze all the time didnt over clock they never touch they besides insert they in case on future mark they barely out preformed the gtx 580 and on some case the 580 finish ahead i have the same issue with previous 6 series card so maybe my board hate AMD but there performance isnt enough to warrant I keep they over my 580 super clocked and the gtx 580 isnt give any issue i think for amd i will bid they farewell until they can fix there amazing driver issue the minute there release good point - erm they look ok i guess bad point - bad driver usual amd error - bad performance consider this be mean to be the next card up from the gtx 580 i dont see it in performance my gtx actually finish higher on alot of game when i finally get a work card install after 8 hour ... , noise omg there loud i hate the gtx 580 for be loud because there loud and hot but these be loud as in off puttingly loud i also find i need to contantly run a 3rd party fan controller for they as they be get to hot and this be in a very well cool pc in a high airflow system haf x sorry for the bad review i dont usually ever give 1 star but i fix and build pc 's i build my pc it could be a board problem with amd i cant really answer that but it seem the driver be the cause i never usually give 1 star or bad review as i believe with computer component its kinda pot luck with gpus i hope you all have better luck with this card than I
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	cause random computer lock up , if there be any audio while this occur , it will loop continuously until you do a hard shutdown . even with this problem , on some occasion I can still play game without lock up . seasonic 560w i5-3450 @ 3.1 Asus P8H77-M pro sapphire radeon hd 7850 Kingston 2x4gb ddr3-1333 Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB Windows 7 64-bit Google these term : Radeon 7970 computer hard lock with sound loop 7xxx Series AMD card : freeze and lock up
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card have be the perfect replacement for my radeon 6970 I be very happy to have purchase the XFX 7970 be be a great card to have overclock factory be very fresh . game with high detail luxury the fan be very quiet . noteworthy that here in Venezuela be tropical climate and the area where I live more or less some heat and still remain in the graph idle state approximately between 36 and 38  c and full load with some title reach 65  and I have no air conditioning . in short all recommend this product be what many player seek when purchase a graph good price , excellent performance , super cool and quiet
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Easy to install and set up despite Vista . I must admit I be experience with atus product and make sure that I uninstall all of the previous ATI driver and software -lrb- no way around it ... or you 'll have problem -rrb- . the install software work fine and update itself without a problem . now my older Asus socket 754 machine with 8x agp do video and most game almost as well as my Athalon 64 x2 machine with pcie video card . a good buy if you be try to get some extra mileage out of a older agp board .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card be one of the best hd 7850s out there . it run quiet and chew through just about every game at max setting . only a couple of the most demand game drop below 60fp and even those game -lrb- the witcher 2 , Crysis , Metro 2033 -rrb- still run very well . get it . you will not be disappoint .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Got this so I could connect 2 monitor to my computer . many of the fancier card require a large amount of power . this one work fine with a 300w power supply . this be not a card for hard core gamer , but if you want to have dual monitor it work quite well . installation take about 5 minute , 4 of which be get the computer open .

GPS	POS	5	this unit be nicely price and well equip . most everyone can pick it up and start use the interface with no more trouble than a ipod -lrb- parent and neighbor include -rrb- . it do not take much space in you car , but if you want to remove from the vehicle often , the Nuvi 's be thinner with bigger screen , but cost more . this be a fantastic navigational aid on trip . do not buy it if you want to go off road or into deep wood , but everyone else will love it .
GPS	POS	4	this unit be a great handheld gp . very rugged . the best feature be the software 's ability to interface with google earth on the computer , and the optional bird eye satellite imaging you can download to the GPS unit -lrb- available from garmin for about 30 buck -rrb- a year . the removable micro sd card allow you to setup and store different map and waypoint for different area on different card . look forward to try out the geocach feature this weekend ! I give it a 4 star review because the product description provide by the Amazon and Garmin website to make a informed decision on which GPS unit would suit my need be mislead . the unit come equip with `` build in base map '' that do not show one road or geographical datum within 10 mile of my home . no information on the base map except freeway and highway . do not include any surface street in my area , so buyer beware . the way i choose to get accurate road and trail information be by purchase the garmin topo map for a additional fee . this map include surface street and some trail information . it do include dirt road . these map only cover certain geographical area , like southern , north eastern and western state . the map be very detailed , include information on my local off road vehicle area . you may have to purchase more than one map set depend on where you be plan to go . the memory card that come with the unit -lrb- 1 gig -rrb- will not hold all the map datum from the topo map I purchase , you either must select smaller area where you will be travel and download to the gp or purchase a larger datum card . I would purchase this unit again !
GPS	POS	5	this unit preform flawlessly and with the free lifetime map the unit pay for itself in two year . I love it and recommend it to all .
GPS	POS	5	have a earlier model and now love the lifetime map and traffic . Easy to update , even with my MAC . traffic function work and there be a lot of information that be easy to read on the screen .
GPS	POS	5	this be a terrific navigation system , and so easy to use ! my husband and I both purchase for we car and we no longer have to worry about direction again ! I have not have any problem with the system not find a street address like I experience with other model in the past . I would definitely recommend to anyone that be shop for a gp .
GPS	POS	4	I buy this device to help I pace my run . it do a decent job at it when it can get the necessary signal . unfortunately , it lose signal pretty often . I be look at the output of the run log program , and it show that I reach a run speed of 20 mile a hour at one point . well , I can hardly get up to that speed on a bike . the error be obviously cause by the lose of signal . because of this , the device be good but not great .
GPS	NEG	1	if you wonder why the 340 cost more than the 350 , read the review . this be the DumDum TomTom . the menu be simplify for you convenience and if that be not you idea of a good thing , you should move on . I do not really have a problem with that . what I have a problem with be TomTom break the unit \* after \* I buy it ! I buy this unit because it would read street name . I get it home , do all the update , and figure out which voice I need to use to have the street name announce . then I go for a drive to test the unit , and the street name be not announce . I check to make sure I have the right voice work and even seek out more major street , think that it might not be able to recognize the smaller street . finally , I go home and check out the support forum . turn out that the latest update of the device software break the street name if the volume be set above 80 or 85 % . the volume at 80 % be not enough to hear the unit over freeway noise and moderate radio volume . TomTom acknowledge that they latest update break the street name and say they will fix it `` in a future update . '' great ! nothing like remotely render you product defective . I 'll wait about a week for a software fix and then return the item . if you would like to avoid the hassle , avoid the product .
GPS	POS	5	Sweet GPS . I have go to multiple big city that I have never be to and get right where I want to go the first time every time . great great product .
GPS	NEG	2	this gp be nicely set up and isnt too hard to operate . the bad side be that there be no website support for the US and it have a tracking problem . this could have be the one I have , but when you stop , gp keep flip you position around as if you be rotate in a circle . when you take off it have to reacquire you position . this be a problem if you be in a area with a lot of street where direction happen often . I would recommend get another gp from another company .
GPS	POS	5	I just get to use it , and it work great . the screen could be a little brighter in the shade .
GPS	POS	5	it be very useful for I because i have lose the original ... it make the same effect ... cheap and now i can use the gp normally
GPS	POS	5	this be my first gp . I have no desire to see any other . I have do the due diligence and research before decide to purchase the Garmin 1300 with lifetime map update . it be the easiest device to use and have find it very reliable get I to my destination . Garmin could do a better marketing job to let customer know what include with the purchase . I be thrill I have purchase the `` best '' product on the market . I never feel like I do not know where I be go ! good product at a good price . Voice feature be loud and clear enough to understand even with music playing at a pretty high volume ... overall could not be happier with my NUVI Charging be the issue i encounter on a road trip . if Nuvi be in direct sunlight it wont charge and the battery drain . still not a problem . if on a long trip in the sun turn it off for a spell to save the life of battery .
GPS	NEG	1	it do not work . I try several time , each time it keep say acquire satellite for about ten minute -lrb- I be outdoor -rrb- . give up . return it .
GPS	POS	5	I receive my Garmin 350 last night and could not wait to try it out . I take a road trip over to Manassas , VA , about 15 mile away and it get I to where I want to go without a hitch . Ok , so it add a turn that I would not have take , since I know where I be go , but that be no big deal . it get I there and the voice direction be great ! it give you plenty of advanced warning as to what lane you should be in for the next turn . after I arrive in Manassas , I select a shopping mall over in Woodbridge , VA and it take I over there , once again , without a hitch . this morning I use it on the way to work , just to see how it would route I . I work at the Pentagon and live about 29 mile south . the Garmin do not miss a beat , until I get to the road that lead in to the south parking area . it be go to route I around the block to get into south parking , but I know a shorter route and take it . either way , it be no big deal , because the Garmin would have get I to the same location about 45 seconds later . if I have be in a strange place , I would not have be the wiser . I be truly impress with this gp and I be sure I 'll get a lot of use out of it .
GPS	POS	5	this be such a awesome tool and it even work overseas !!! I have track a few mile on it and it work like a champ . i buy the nike + a while back and it be not cut it not enough information and i lose the watch part of it . the 110 have a heart rate monitor and it track you complete run from speed , heart rate , distance , and elevation . this be the tool you need to improve you game !!!
GPS	NEG	1	while this unit be well-priced and be outfit with all the great feature -lrb- include voice command , Bluetooth , HD traffic , smart route , etc -rrb- , it have a clumsy interface , and much more importantly , it can not find or hold on to a gp signal . I read every technical forum , try every software update and fix , and nothing could make this thing work . after read online , it seem like hundred of other have have the exact same problem with the GO LIVE line . Bells and whistle aside , a gp be not worth anything if it can not locate you on a map ... return , and now stick with Garmin .
GPS	POS	5	this be a great unit . I purchase the TomTom go 910 because it be preload with map of North America and Europe . I be in Europe more than the USA so I want a unit that could get I around all the european country seamlessly . many unit require that you switch european map between country , but not this unit . I can report that the unit work perfectly . I recently drive from Lyon , France to Torino , Italy and then to Cameri , Italy . the unit work fast to define the best route and get I to my destination without any error . in fact , in Torino I go to a friend 's apartment follow the direction exactly . when the unit say `` you arrive at you destination '' stop the car among large building downtown and phone my friend to see if he know where I be . he look out he apartment from the fifth floor and wave to I ! the unit place I directly in front of he apartment . and yes , it never lose signal even when on the narrow road bury between tall building . I also notice that in the small town of Cameri , Italy it know every small road in town . it be also interesting to note that the unit track you approximate location even when go thru tunnel -lrb- I have no signal but it apparently assume you be still go the same speed -rrb- . but after a few minute in the long tunnel it stop and wait for you exit and then refresh in about a minute . here be what I really like : \* it be very accurate and calculate route very quickly . if you make a wrong turn , it recalculate in second and get you back on the right track . \* Preloaded map of Europe , and they be accurate . \* alert you if the speed limit drop and you be go too fast . in fact , I be watch it change as I pass speed limit sign -lrb- in Europe -rrb- , and the go910 change within foot of pass the sign -lrb- how do they do that ? -rrb- . \* alert you to speed camera -lrb- in Europe -rrb- . \* have a remote control that be very handy . with the touch of a button , you can have it repeat its last instruction or tell you the next instruction . also can change volume and access all the other feature . \* signal strength be very good . I pick up nearly full signal when dock in my house , apartment -lrb- in Europe -rrb- or office . of course , I have great signal strength in the car , even though I have one of those GM car with the metallic coating in the windshield -lrb- my old Garmin GPS III unit would not work well thru the windshield -rrb- . \* Long battery life , more than six hour . \* Speaker and sound be very clear . \* when you plan you route , it provide a estimate of arrival time . I find on a six hour trip it be within three minute . here be what I do not like : \* the screen be hard to see in really bright sunlight and you be wear sunglass . lift off you glass help , but it be still tough to read . \* the windshield mount work fine , but the power connection from the mount to the unit be not work -lrb- the unit run out of battery after about six hour -rrb- . \* do not come with a carry case . sure it have a little case for the main unit , but if you drop it there will be little protection from a hard floor .
GPS	POS	4	I be pleasently surprise after use this unit . I read some horror story from some reviewer after I have already orderd it and even think about cancel . all you have to do be read the manual -lrb- which be short and concise -rrb- before you start and you should have absoloutly no problem . I read some review which complain of shoddy construction . not true ! the map that ship with the unit be work great although they be ship the newest map to I for free . for anyone that do any travel in Europe , this gp come pre-loaded with all of the european map as well as Canada and the US .
GPS	NEU	3	I have this unit for about a week , and the gp functionality work great . my main complaint be the connectivity . it come with a rs232 serial cable , which be ancient . if you want to use this with a Mac , or a pc without this connector , a $ 20 adapter be necessary . with that in mind , you might as well spend a extra $ 35 and get the eTrex Venture HC . it have a high sensitivity chip , usb connectivity , color screen , 3 x memory , geocach mode , etc. . Garmin be brilliant in differentiate they product just enough that make you want to spend $ 35 for the next model up . in my opinion , they purposely cripple the connectivity on this to make the more expensive model within reach . rs232 serial be ancient , and I do not believe it be any cheaper for Garmin to produce this unit with rs232 over the 12 year old standard mini usb connector . it be they prerogative to sell what they want at the price point of they choosing , but I would not recommend this unit . pony up $ 35 more and get the Venture HC .
GPS	NEU	3	welcome to knock-off city . when the case arrive , it smell like a combination of a tire lot and smolder plastic . then have to use scissors to trim the excess fabric in order for the zipper to close properly . it be cheap and with a few adjustment , you can make it work .
GPS	POS	5	I be worry about my Garmin GPS screen get scratch when not in use . I find this case on Amazon and think it might be just the thing I need . I fall in love with it . now the screen be protect and no one can see it in my car . great product for those large screen .
GPS	POS	5	this be the 2nd gp we have buy . out of the box we just love it . so many POI , very easy to use , you do not even have to read the manual . love the WIFI , seem to work pretty good . I have some problem get it to sign on but still a nice feature . the one thing I really like about it be the next turn be on display , and that really help . the 2nd best feature be once you reach you destination the gp do not keep try to send you back to you location when you leave . for the price of $ 120 , buy it !
GPS	NEG	2	while this product say it fit 4.3 '' gp device - they do not tell you that if you device have any connective add-on for cabling -lrb- e.g. garmin -rrb- the additional piece do NOT fit in this case which be ` glove tight ' for the basic device . if you just have a 4.3 '' device this product will be fine .
GPS	POS	5	this be we first gp and we love it . it do exactly what we want it to do which be get we from Ohio to South Carolina for we vacation without get we lose , send we way out in the middle of nowhere , etc. . we have have a lot of issue with use mapquest , phone GPS , etc in the past so we be concern about it get we lose in the mountain or send we to some tiny town in the middle of nowhere like last year with a borrow gp . we fully charge it before we leave and it hold the charge for 5 hour of constant use . we be not able to get it to charge or turn on by use the cigarette adapter , but we have a ac\/dc adapter in the car for my laptop so we just plug in into that and it charge just fine . the times\/miles be pretty accurate though it do seem to have a lag time if you change from the pre-planned route . I be sure there be other gp ' out there that offer a lot more bell and whistle , but this be perfect for someone who just want a basic gp with a simple interface . I also like that we do not have to buy new map and update like I have hear friend have to do . it do take about 90 minute for I to do the first update from the computer , but that be no big deal . I be look forward to use this on more trip .
GPS	POS	5	I be very interested when I learn that there be product that allow the integration of a street map atla with a gp and laptop computer . sound like a excellent tool for travel . after explore a number of option on the web , it appear that the Delorme Earthmate with Street Atlas USA be the way to go , although I read as many bad review as good . the price be certainly reasonable and I decide , why not ? I must say that after two day of see what this thing can do , I be truly impressed . the Street Atlas be a breeze to set up and I love the feature that allow you to copy region to the hard drive , so this thing will run san CD . the include Earthmate GPS amaze I for its diminutive size and good construction , as I appreciate the inclusion of the rubber foot and rubber strip around the unit . within 5 minute the GPS have initialize and I become a green dot on the map show my neighborhood . I immediately jump into the car and wathch my progress on the screen as a friend drive I around town . the accuracy amaze I . then I get serious to see what this unit could do . if I have to make a negative comment , it would have to be the lack of instructional material . two -lrb- tiny -rrb- booklet come in the package that do little more than explain the setup . there be a tutorial build into the program , but it do not have the same functionality as a reference manual . however , if the lack of documentation be help to keep this package at this steal of a price , then I be all for it . after three-and-a-half hour of playing , I have a good handle on all of the feature of the software and be ready to plan my first trip . there be a great deal of information available on these map , include restaurant and lodging and service available off the various exit on the highway . you can enter the name of a restaurant , and Street Atlas will locate it for you on the map . you can then take the laptop\/gps combo in the car , and it will give you real time verbal instuction as you be drive . Pretty cool ! some of the `` point of interest '' be not in the right spot on the map , and some be long go , but I can not fault the software for not know that the pizza place at the shore go out of business six month ago . all in all , it be a package that appear to do what it be design to do . whether or not it be practical in the long run to have all this equipment run in the car -lrb- you can swap the laptop for a smaller device -rrb- have yet to be determine , but my first impression be actually beyond my expectation .
GPS	NEG	1	I purchase this in Sept 2011 . work ok to begin with . then it start freezing up , but I could cut it off and it would get ok . on 2\/23\/2012 , it freeze up again while down town Detroit and I try to get out of that city . this be just a piece of junk . it be still freeze up and I will probably purchase some other type of GPS . I would not reccomend anyone waste they money on a GARMIN .
GPS	POS	5	this be my first gp watch and I could not be more pleased with it so far . the forerunner 305 feel well make and do not lose signal even when I run through wood . the best part in my opinion be be able to easily download all of the datum from you run when you get home and even overlay you path over Google map and Earth use free 3rd party tool . it would be nice if the watch be smaller , but it be light enough . other than that I would not change a thing .
GPS	POS	5	I get this from amazon for $ 450 . it be worth every penny ! I have use it daily since I just move to Tampa - it be a pretty big city but I get around without any problem thanks to the Nuvi !
GPS	POS	4	first , as everybody have comment . . the display on this 3790t look AMAZING ! compare it to ANY other gp and the difference be almost like black and white tv in 1956 to today 's hdtv ! the Display not only look good it be very use-able in any light . . even direct sunshine hit it be screen . I have a top of the line Magellan ... you can barely see the screen when it get very bright out . anyway , I would rather talk about a few quirk or negative as I feel a review should help one decide if the pro of a device out weigh any negative . my first major con be that I have only see the Juntion View screen pop up maybe 3 time in over almost 2 week of drive . I live in NY and there be a ton of Juntions I have pass thru . the 3790t doe show lane assist -lrb- the arrow which lane to be in for upcome turn -rrb- BUT it simply almost never show a juntion view . I actually return my first unit think it be simply defective . . it be NOT . so from my experience you be barely go to see juntion view on this unit at least in NY . I have read other review that state they see a lot of juntion view . . but in NY unless I have a second defective unit ? ... you can almost forget the fact the 3790t have juntion View . as a side note my Magellan show a juntion type view at 1,000 time to one vs this unit . my second con . . be more about refinement . this darn gp be roughly $ 400 depend on the deal you get . the voice inside my unit sometimes though rarely , will crack . meaning . . if a map be zoom in or or out I have notice the voice break up . this have only happen 2 time in 2 week . . but in a $ 400 unit this be unacceptable . another con for I be my first unit freeze up the minute I decide to NOT follow the gp 's route as I know a shorter way to go . I have to re boot it . . all be well but again ... refine ? $ 400 no ! my last and maybe biggest con be traffic ??? what ?? this Garmin be tell I there be a ton of traffic on my route YET my radio 's traffic report be not mention any traffic where the Garmin be tell I it be . also the Garmin be auto re route I off my route because it think there be a ton of traffic come up . well . . I do not listen to the Garmin , and there be no traffic where it say it be . on the other hand . . one time the 3790t tell I all road be clear . . while I be sit in traffic , barely move 10mph on 55 mph road . so it have be my experience that the traffic feature be near useless . or at least maybe it be a hour or 2 behind reality . that be say my Magellan 's traffic feature be just as useless . so after all this complain why do I still give it 4 star ? well . . overall I actually love this unit . overall it pick excellent route , I like the timing of the voice tell I where next to turn . . it be very difficult to miss a turn with the 3790t . . it be excellent at guidance . I choose a female New Zealand voice -lrb- build in -rrb- and it be very refreshing to be able to change voice ... as one voice can get monotonous after you own a gp for a long while . I love the size of the unit . . more than as a toy . . it be so pocket able a huge plus over the other dinosaur gp unit out there now . battery life seem good and overall construction seem high end . . except I get a little creeky sound on the small plastic part on the back if I press on it , that also house the speaker . the voice quality be awesome blow away the Magellans . . -lrb- I do not know TomTom -rrb- . . and it be loud as you can stand . Voice command -lrb- you speak to the unit -rrb- be near excellent though you may need speak rather loudly or it may just stare at you . : -rrb- I do love you can even use you voice to choose you custom favorite . however you only get 5 favorite at a time to choose from . if you do not see the one you want . . you have to say DOWN . . it will scroll down another 5 and another 5 -lrb- or it be 4 at a time -rrb- do not recall . eventually you see you favorite . . choose the NUMBER next to it . . and bam , all by voice you can start navigate . I wish you could say the name of you favorite -lrb- as in speech to text -rrb- ... say you name you favorite Mike 's place or whatever you have it name . instead you need scroll possibly thru 100 's of favorite till yours be find via voice . of course you can simply use the screen and type it take a second actually BUT so much for voice command then . lastly one feature common to I think all garmin which I love be within favorite you can see all the favorite near the one you just go to . my Magellan can not do that . . and be I be in sale . . this be a wonderful useful feature cause i may have a customer 2 block away from where I be and the 3790t will tell I so ... which may have skip my mind otherwise . to sum up my book -lrb- sorry -rrb- this be truly a wonderful unique great gp . . with excellent route . . which be why we buy a gp . I just initially want to point out some negative as too often review become almost like a team event . . mean I love Garmin . . or Panasonic or WHATEVER , often that cloud be objective . . I want to be objective here ... all in all quirk and all , I think this may be you favorite gp of you lifetime . . till the next model improve on he one `` somehow '' highly recommend !!
GPS	POS	5	I have to throw my experience in here after read many negative review about Garmin customer service . I first have a Garmin V Deluxe then upgrade to the 60c . I love my 60c ... I be certain there be some con , but I can not think of many right now . it would be great to have expandable memory . customer service : I have trouble with my Mapsource software cd . I get a response email within 48 hour ... and they replace my CD within the week . I have a question about function on my gp v and I get a reply again within 48 hour . two different occassion I get great support from Garmin . it may not be typical , but it do happen . back to the 60c ... I really like it . I use it while hike to keep track of the trip -lrb- odometer , time elapse , back track -rrb- I use it geocach . I use it in the car . -lrb- smaller screen but still useable -rrb- the color make it really nice and clear .
GPS	NEG	2	I just return the second Garmin 1450lmt which arrive without any user 's manual . it do have a `` Quick Start Guide '' , but this be inadequate to explain the function of the unit . Amazon try for 15 minute to contact Garmin and then give up .
GPS	NEG	2	I have own this for a few month . the first few time it work fine , good capture etc. . then after a few week , the on\/off system fail like many other reviewer have state . I like the compact size , however the build quality be a little weak for constant outdoor use . the main problem be the on\/off switch , it simply be not dependable . also do anyone know be I can download the firmware ? any hint on the reset switch ? it also do not seem to work well .
GPS	POS	5	1 . script : Easy Consumer Friendly internet order !!!!! 2 . Service : customer support Pleasant Professional , Helpful , and courteous !!!!! 3 . Super : Price and quality of Product !!!!! 4 . surprise : none !!!!!!! 5 . shipping : prompt and on time !!!!! 6 . security : very secure site !!! -lcb- Bonus Star -rcb- !! deserve a `` Atta Boy '' award for outstanding business !!!!! thanks for a great experience !!!! the sutton
GPS	POS	5	purchase the c330 , and it arrive the day before we trip to so . Florida to visit the grandkid . it only get lose once in Alabama on SR-76 , but I believe that problem have be correct in the software upgrade that be free from the Garmin site . the product be better than I think , and be perfect . visibility be just fine in bright daylight , and it be a Godsend at night . every little twist in the road appear on the screen . it switch automatically to nighttime mode , and back to day operation . Worth every penny !
GPS	NEU	3	this should be my 3rd waterproof camera , so why should ? because I be return it due a lot of minor issue and bad material quality . I have a Lumix ts-2 and another Lumix ts-3 , now I try this Nikon aw-100 think about have a CMOS camera instead a CCD camera but I could not believe that this camera be so sensitive . in just one week in my pocket chare with my hotel card the lcd cover be totally damage by the plastic card . also the camera be not more sensitive than the CCD as they promise here be a difference but you can not feel it . the image quality be good , but the configuration menu be quite hard to understand . I be go to buy another Lumix .
GPS	NEU	3	some bad point : 1 . -rrb- the manual for the Magellan Road Mate 3030 4.7-inch portable GPS Navigator be hardly a manual at all . it lack basic simple instruction on how to use it . whoever be in charge of documentation should grab one of the Garmin or Motorola manual and learn how manual should be write . for the price one pay for these unit , Magellan should be able to afford to hire a better writer . 2 . -rrb- the unit lack a save function\/button after correction be make en-route during trip which have be incorrectly plot by the map system in the first place . it refuse to accept correction and keep reroute one via u-turn . later trip use the same start point and destination provide route with the same error . 3 . -rrb- the unit when purchase have NAV map , as show in the product description , and when that same product description be visit one week later the map be change to tele-atla . I be wonder whether it be legal for a company to switch the map system without notify consumer . 4 . -rrb- Magellan Road-Mates restrict registration of they unit to Windows Explorer browser and doe not allow you to register if one want to use other browser . and some good : 1 . -rrb- the screen be large and very clear . there be a variety of customization option like navigation and map settings\/preferences , auto-setting , and nice keyboard layout . 2 . -rrb- the speech be relatively clear when the volume be increase , although it suffer severely at time in pronunciation of certain letter and combination of letter . 3 . -rrb- Advance warning of upcome turn be well place and quick although call the bend on the SAME road should be eliminate . they confuse one about upcome actual turn . a bend in a road be not a turn , and cause the driver to look for a upcome turn \* off \* of the current road , which be what a turn mean . 4 . -rrb- I be give this unit a b - grade .
GPS	NEU	3	the graphic on this device be much sharper and color much better than previous version I have own -lrb- Nuvi 660 be the last -rrb- . that make the display interface more invite although the map display seem pretty much the same -lrb- albeit better resolution -rrb- . the voice pronunciation be significantly improve over previous model . it be more fluid and street be pronounced much better . the fact that it can be use in `` portrait '' mode be great ... I like see further ahead on my route when I want to . I also love the customization of the display info on the map to include thing like mileage remain or altitude or time remain or time to turn or direction etc. . all these thing be much better than previous model ... in fact a order of magnitude better . I find the voice recognition to be pretty good give the noisy environment of a car -lrb- turn off you radio when you talk and it work even better ! -rrb- . however , the number of command control by voice be very limited . you can not pan and zoom use voice and you can not switch to the `` datum '' screen from the map -lrb- but you can go the other way -rrb- . they should make a lot more of the command available by voice but just zoom in\/out would be a major major improvement for `` hand free '' use . the major disappointment for I be in the route . I drive from Houston to San Antonio and back four time a month . it be 200 mile each way of which 189 mile be on Interstate 10 . I have one stoplight each way . my nuvus 660 -lrb- and daughter 270w -rrb- both route I along i-10 for 189 mile . unfortunately , this device have I exit off the highway at one exit and get right back on after go through the intersection . this make absolutely no sense . I estimate there be 30 instance of this . I have try change the preference for route and that help some but it still want I to get off . I think that for some reason it want I to take us90 rather than i-10 but clearly that would be foolish . also , leave home , it send I six block up , one block over and five block back to get on the highway so you drive right past the very street it put you back on later -- and it even recognize they be interconnect . it also can not direct I to my home but admittedly it be hard to get to my place because it be right next to a huge urban interchange and the road be hard to map . nevertheless , you buy a gp for route and this do a very poor job . I can not recommend the traffic reporting . it do not see any of the traffic directly in front of I but it do for accident 70 or 100 mile out . not very useful . also , the killer for this be that I pay a huge amount of money for this device but apparently they insist on sell advertising on the traffic display -lrb- how much do they make ? one or two cent ?? -rrb- . this be suppose to show the sign above the highway interchange but it only do it once . since then , no joy ... it tell you about the route but it do not show the sign . the display of 3-d building be fun and surprisingly accurate but not very dense even in Houston . therefore it do not really help navigate by provide visual clue on the route . they have come a long way with the device but , unfortunately , the route problem be significant . in the end , that make it , at best , a `` 3 '' for I . of course , you may have a better experience living in another part of the country .
GPS	NEG	1	I buy this navigation system 3 month ago because I do not want to pay close to the same price to update my Garmin map , but I now realize that be a mistake . the Garmin I buy over two year ago still surpass the technology of the TomTom . the quality of the graphic on the TomTom be significantly inferior . TomTom -lrb- with up-to-date map -rrb- can not find neither of my parent ' house -lrb- grant , one live in a newly establish neighborhood but be still over a year old , while the other life in a older neighborhood and street -- over 10 year old -rrb- . additionally , when the address be consider `` valid '' , TomTom announce you have arrive once you be in the vacinity of you destination . at this point , you have to look around -lrb- either to the left or right because it do not indicate that either -rrb- for the exact location . another feature I like from my old Garmin be that it tell I which street -lrb- and direction -rrb- to turn on , so when you have street close together , you be sure to turn on the right one . with TomTom , I have often turn on the wrong street and one time , it even have I go through a parking lot to get to a main road . finally , once I reach either of my parent 's house , it would have be nice to add `` current location '' to my favorite , but that be not a option -lrb- at least that I find -rrb- . to end on a positive note , I do love the screen and the information it display -lrb- outside of the graphic -rrb- .
GPS	POS	5	Great GPS . my old Garmin be four year old and miss the charger . the suction cup keep fall off of it . I purchase this one for a trip to South Florida . it work like a charm . great investment for someone who travel . it be idiot proof !
GPS	POS	5	do a great job protect my Garmin Nuvi . it be compact size make it a perfect addition to any glovebox or purse .
GPS	POS	4	. . be that the heartrate appear in very small font at the right corner which make it impossible to read when run . there be no disply option that I have find that would allow I to look at the heartrate in a bigger font screen center . I think they try to fix this in a later model . bummer ! overall , I like this product .
GPS	POS	5	receive promptly and item be package well . great to do business with . thank you .
GPS	NEU	3	I like my garmin Etrex Vista . it be easy to use , seem sturdy and reliable .  major disadvantage : 1 -rrb- the only way to connect this unit to a computer be via a rs232 interface -lrb- old technology -rrb- . I purchase a non-garmin usb-rs232 converter cable but have not be able to make it work ; 2 -rrb- there be no way to connect the unit to a 110 volt source -lrb- read battery -rrb- . I jury rig this by purchase a cable that connect the unit to a car cigarette lighter -lrb- also have a rs232 connection -rrb- and purchase a converter -lrb- $ 5.96 -rrb- that convert 110 to 12 volt with a cigarette lighter output . it work .
GPS	POS	4	after a high recommendation we purchase the Garmen 350 . it be wonderful . the kid call she `` Miss Bossy '' because she direct we every move .
GPS	POS	5	it do not always take you on the right path but it get you where you want to go . it be easy to program and easy to use . I love it and now I will not get lose look for new place to go . product ship on time and arrive in perfect condition .
GPS	POS	5	I be new to run , listen to several of my `` runner friend '' about how this watch would help I in all stage of my run , but especially as I transition to couch 25k . I buy this watch from Amazon and be SUPER happy with the watch . pro ~ \* it look like a normal watch , unlike previous bulky version and it fit a variety of wrist size . \* it appear to be heavy duty and well make , buckle be sturdy , strap be all thick , flexible rubber , be comfortable to run in , do not snag on anything while on my wrist . \* I can usually connect with a satellite within 1 minute of attempt . I run in town , have not have any interference with connect or dead spot along my run . \* it be user friendly , you may have to breeze through the user manual to figure out how to link up with the heart rate monitor and locate satellite , but if you be at all technically savvy , you can figure this out pretty simply . \* it use a handy convertible charger \ usb to charge or upload , one cord , less hassle . \* I upload to Garmin Connect website , connect to my device well , I choose upload new activity , and whah-lah , I can see a red highlight of my entire workout route each time I upload , even the day i forget to turn off the satellite and drive with my runner partner to Steak-and-Shake for they breakfast special . : -rrb- it be really awesome to see a re-playable virtual map of you run and at what point you heart rate , speed , distance . . etc. . you can view 2 separate chart , or all 3 at once that show performance on each run . if you want to link with other local runner , you can make yourself visible online , perhaps even share route ~ I have no interest in that though , so I disable that function . online software work great on my iMac . I also use the android mobile app for the Garmin Connect website , it be call `` Ga Co Mo. '' it do not show EVERY feature the Garmin website show , but it be a super nice , on the run way to refer back to you stats , calorie burn , date and activity , include modify chart and datum . the mobile app do not let you enter manual activity , like something you forget to enter that you do and remember the activity detail . but instead , you can enter that information online by enter a `` manual '' activity , then you can `` fetch new activity '' from you mobile app and you new activity will then show . \* the user profile on the watch help calculate more accurate datum , like gender , height , weight . use the heart rate monitor be the next step to personalize you run and more accurately measure calorie burn . definitely better to buy the watch with the heart rate monitor include , so much cheaper to buy it bundle !! con ~ \* the charger cord \ usb have a clip with 4 contact point to connect with the back of the watch , sometimes the watch do not charge because those contact point be not exactly line up . I may have a short in the cord too , not sure , but I have to double check each time to make sure it be charge . \* I do experience the screen lock up \ blank screen issue after 2 week of use . I follow what the Garmin web forum say to do and it work the second try . -lrb- while in Power Save Mode , press and hold the light button for 7 seconds , unit will shut off , then press and hold it again for 2 seconds and it should power back up fix the freeze issue -rrb- since then , I make sure to power off the unit after each use and it have not happen since , that be 2 month ago and no problem . ADDITIONAL : the watch be now 3 month old , just last week I notice a small crack in the PAGE \ MENU button , the next day the button must have break in half and be miss . I be work with Garmin currently on how how I can get either a replacement button , or fix , the original paper claim 1 year product warantee . because I do not buy it from Garmin or a physical store , I be a little concerned on warantee . I will post again to let you know how that go . I would definitely buy THIS PRODUCT again , it come highly recommend by MY RUNNER FRIENDS , it give me all the DATA I could possibly want !
GPS	NEG	2	the GPS unit be impressive , but mine keep drop the satellite signal and recalculate to a different destination . I try download the latest software from they site , but it do not fix the problem . Amazon be replace the unit and I will see if the new one work correctly .
GPS	POS	5	I have have my forerunner 305 for over a year and it be my favorite piece of run equipment . I stay on track with it and I use sporttrack and sync my workout to facebook which make I more accountable . if you be think about get one I would highly recommend it . I have hear some negative thing about other model but mine be still go strong after hundred of workout . it hold up well in the rain and the heart rate strap have last 10x as long as the reebok monitor I have before .
GPS	POS	5	just put this review to clear my account , I use to have this and it be great , travel many road with it . -lrb- have a Zumo 550 now -rrb-
GPS	NEG	1	boater : if you be look for a handheld GPS for marine purpose , you need to be aware that this model come out of the box with a base-loaded database that include almost nothing in the way of aid to navigation . while the older map76 model include a database of coastal navigational aid -lrb- buoy , light , nun , can , whistle , gong , lighthouse , etc -rrb- , this model do not include any of these . if you turn on this model and scroll over to Boston Harbor or San Francisco Bay , it will show you where the water be and where the land begin , but nothing more . no navigational aid whatsoever . yes , it will give you lat\/lon fix like any gp . and it will give you speed and head information . but that be it . of course , Garmin tell you that you can purchase the detailed marine chart -lrb- they cost $ 100 - $ 200 each for just a single area ... in the Northeast , you would need to purchase many of these to get complete coverage -rrb- and this be understand . but most serious boater use detailed paper chart and\/or a plotter and do not need they handheld for that kind of detail . what a handheld be good for , however , be to show where you be in relation to a bell or a light you may be run toward in the fog or in the dark or in relation to a known waypoint . the old version -lrb- map 76 -rrb- give you these bell and light . this one do not . so unless you want to add many hundred of dollar to you $ 275 - $ 300 purchase price , this be the wrong model for a handheld gp as backup . get the older map 76 instead . for less than $ 200 , you will have more than you need as a helpful boater 's unit and no need to buy electronic chart . of course , the map 76 be B&W; and not color , possibly less sensitive , and lack all the bell and whistle . but it be WAY more simple to use . this map 76csx be very complicated because it have build in all the highway , hike , climb , geocach , urban feature and capability that you will never use . just figure out the setup take hour . bottom line ... Garmin be a great product . but if you be a serious boater -lrb- not want to drop a thousand on a complicated handheld -rrb- and someopne who navigate with paper chart or a regular chart plotter , you do not want this model ... you want the map76 . many sailor just want the peace of mind from a backup . this be not it . happy sailing
GPS	POS	5	I buy the Garmin GPS for my husband for Christmas and use it on we trip to Myrtle Beach . it be wonderful not have to check map to find we way especially at night ! the voice be very calm and let we know in advance when to turn . it make for a very enjoyable trip . I highly recommend it !
GPS	POS	4	this my 2nd Garmin I have have . I like the feature that let you see ETA , mile remain , speed and elevation along with the map , all at the same time . also it it acquire the satellite signal quicker than my old Garmin 260 . dislike the time it take to update map. , about 1.5 hr .
GPS	POS	5	I use my new Garmin Nuvi 1450 a few day after I receive it on a trip from New York State to North Carolina . the screen be bright , clear and easy to use . love the voice direction that actually tell you the road or street name as you be ready to turn onto it . I would recomend it to anyone that drive .
GPS	POS	4	I use the Garmin c330 the entire weekend throw different destination at it . there be one it do not have I just put in the cross street and it find it no problem . this gp be the Apple Macintosh of GPS Units . it just work , it pick up satellite extremely fast , it be simple to use , the windshield mount be probably one of the best I have use . I have not try out the `` detour '' feature yet but it will help when I be stick in construction or in traffic . the internal battery help when try to plan trip and setup favorite while not in you car . as for it not be user replaceable I be glad it be not . do not need to be . not a serious disadvantage . if you want a gp that just work without have to worry about the other `` geeky '' feature like see the satellite and thing . the Garmin c330 be the one to get . the speaker be loud and clear I like to have my radio pretty loud and I be still able to hear the c330 . the drawback be like everyone else have say , it be not good in direct sunlight but with the voice prompt it be not a big issue .
GPS	POS	4	the Garmin c330 have a clear readable screen . the audio sound be very good . the one weakness be not its base but the clamp that be suppose to hold the unit onto the base . as soon as there be a bump or dip in the road it fall off the clamp . I have have to resort to use tape to hold it firmly . there need to be improvement of this feature . overall I like the Garmin c330 .
GPS	POS	5	this be such a nice small and cheap item , I have to order 2 of they , just to have one in each car .
GPS	POS	4	I go out of town to Las vegas and take my new Garmin with I . it work great ! I be able to find my way around town , and even into the desert . the traffic option be cool , but there be a occasional popup . but free traffic info be worth the small blurb . the search function , which I use to find hotel be a bit laggy . if you have a address , it be quick . all around a great device . this be my first Garmin . I buy a Tom Tom at a discount deal-a-day website , and be painfully disappoint . this be a great value with unlimited lifetime map . very accurate .
GPS	POS	5	I have have this gp since August 07 , I love it !! wonder why I do not buy one sooner . I like it so well I buy my parent one for Christmas . it be so easy to use right out of the box . my uncle have a Tom Tom I find it very difficult to use . the garmin be simple !!
GPS	NEG	2	this be a device for the person who like to get into the inside of the system -lrb- I believe its call hacking -rrb- . for such a person , the device be great . I would not recommend it for a novice . here 's why : 1 . the text to voice pronunciation be terrible . the word run together , for example , ` San Jose ' be pronounced sanozay , San Francisco sound like ` sunfrincisco ' . now , the interesting bit be that this issue can easily be fix by someone who can hack into the system and make a few small tweak . I wonder why TomTom can not just do be in the device they ship out , or as a software update to those already sell . 2 . this device - 540 World Traveler Edition - be pitch as have complete US , Canada , Mexico and Europe map . truth be , this gp do not have room for the newest version of these map . you can have all of North America , but not all Europe , only bit of it . for example , you can have Western Europe , but then you can not have southern Europe - because there be not room on the device to accommodate that particular map . same thing for Eastern or Central Europe . this would not be such a big deal if you could be selective about which N. AM . country map you need , so you could leave out Canada , or Mexico or US , and make room for all of Europe . but you can not do that . 3 . the worst thing be that it take age to upload map , or swap out between the regionsl european pap . we be talk hour . if I be to travel to Europe , I would therefore have to lug along my laptop and flip map back and forth every time I want to go from , say , the UK to Italy , or from Sweden to the Czech Republic . and wait around for a few hour while the GPS sit around upload the right map . I think that if TomTom do not fix the map problem within a reasonable time , I will probably send it back , since the device do not function as advertise . have say all that , once you hack it and set it up properly , it work well -lrb- except for the map problem -rrb- .
GPS	NEG	2	I buy the Garmin nuvus 1300lm 4.3-inch portable GPS navigator with lifetime map update . I have have it about a week and have only use it in area that I be familiar with . I do not want to even think about travel in a unfamiliar area with it and surely will not do that without a backup map . several time the direction could have get I into a awful situation . once I be direct onto a minor side street that would have make I miss my freeway entrance . another time I be direct onto the wrong interstate . if I have not be familiar with the proper route , no tell how much I would have have to go out of my way . other direction have be marginal . direct I to a street name , which be not post instead of a highway number that be and other thing like that . hopefully on the next update these thing will be improve . I do like some of the other feature that be not available on my old Garmin . my old Garmin be much better at give correct route , so I know they can do it . I be go to keep my new one and hope for the best . I will be travel with auxillary map though !
GPS	POS	5	I really enjoy my garmin nuvus 2360lmt . it look great in my cobalt and with purchase of eco-route hd give it even more acurate reading for economy and bonus for when you have a check engine light . I have a few bug with my nuvus when I get it because the seller sell I one that be once open register and use and then return . I work with garmin support and they get it all set up so it be not register to I with no problem . I can now update it and download stuff to it from garmin garage with ease . traffic be a great feature and be highly accurate from what I have notce . only down side I have with this device be the add but they do not pop up while drive and as often and you would imagine .
GPS	POS	5	like the first Nuvi . only have it for two week and it be steal . like the first one well enough to replace it with same model .
GPS	POS	5	order this at the same time as order a Cobra XRS 9340 . I be very please with the design & function of this device . as i see it it be a must have since the original suction cup that come with most laser\/radar warner be crap .
GPS	POS	5	I first experience a rental car Garmin which be why I buy mine - superfantastic for get around LA , travel from the mid-west to CA . so much easier and safer than look a map or write down direction . a must for big city drive and travel cross country - find hotel , gas station , coffee shop , nearby store with great ease - phone number supply so you can call to make reservation , etc. . how do I live without it ?
GPS	POS	4	I buy this unit for hike and hunting in the Rockies . like other reviewer have say there be alot to like about it . Garmin do a great job of packing 10 lb of stuff in a very small package . but , there be some negative to point out . the button and user interface software be the weakest point . because the unit be small , the button be on the side except for the `` click stick '' . I have a hard time use the `` stick '' with glove on and invariably push down when I mean to push to a side as a example . I also have a hard time press the small side button with glove on . I find some of the screen and menu option counterintuitive but learn to navigate they after several mis-step . battery usage be high . screen size be small so this probably be not a unit you want to use in a vehicle .
GPS	POS	4	I have own the garmin c530 for about a year now , and i have to say its quite nice and perform well . I use it nearly everyday as i drive for a living , it never get I lose no matter how many wrong turn i make . it have a vast amount of point of interest store in it allready with the ability to add more . it have a excellent battery life , and be also quite durable . i wil say though on the other hand its be bad when i tcomes to pick the best route . I can be on the interstate and it may want to send I down a small highway that would take 20 minute longer than just stay on the freeway . also drive time be quite accurate also . people complain that they be `` optimistic '' which its suppose to be as the gp beleive or not doesnt know how many redlight u will hit . also u can program red light camera into it so it will alert when ur comee up on one .
GPS	NEU	3	voice talk like person have marble in they mouth . many name and direction be hard to understand , could not pronounce ` county ' . some address and street could not be find . incorrectly call out road name . sometimes give wrong direction to turn . we feel that we have to have the appropriate map handy to make sure it be direct we correctly . difficult to enter some city\/road name -- after typing in a few of the letter a list would come up , if you name be not on the list , there be no way to override that list . we do not recommend this product , as we feel it be overhype .
GPS	NEG	1	this be junk , just like every piece of technology . the map do not update and it can not locate major city or street . use a compass and map , the never fail system .
GPS	POS	4	fairly easy to use out of the box . I be lucky enough to know someone that already have one . it be confuse that when you enter a address that to save it you have to hit do , if you do not you will not have the address again if you have intend on store it . you have to remember that the global positioning system be not 100 % accurate . when use it to go to a relative home I need it because it be a fairly complicated area , once there it announce the house be on the right when it be on the left . so make sure you check the address . it can be off . also if there have be recent construction it might not be update to tell you where the entrance be on a highway . the nice thing be if you take a wrong turn , the unit announce `` recalculate '' in a rather upset voice , and then give you another route . it will not necessarily give you the fastest route , but you will get there .
GPS	NEG	1	I have just purchase the new c330 StreetPilot through Amazon.com . every time I turn it on it give I message : `` can not unlock map -lrb- ok -rrb- '' . the map be not load I be get only basic map layout . I have reset the unit without result . Garmin technical support be unreachable by phone . I be tell it will take they 5 day to respond by Email . this be quite ridiculous situation . I own 3 other Garmin product and those be work fine .
GPS	POS	5	I have a gp v that I really like and this be one of the best add-on for it or any Garmin GPS .  the gp v come with the require mount bracket , and other model do too , but if not , you need to make sure you get it along with this .  this friction mount be relatively small but stay well on all dashboard I have use it on . it be pretty flat so it travel well in a suitcase or carry-on bag . it allow you to position the unit in the most appropriate spot in the vehicle and then use the clap attach to the GPS , adjust the angle of the display so it be optimal .  Detaching and re-attach the clamp unit with the friction mount could not be easier . for such a small and inexpensive add-on , I could not ask for more .
GPS	NEG	1	purchase this print server and a compatible HP printer assume it should be simple to hook up . while I be not a computer geek , I set my cable wireless modem and three other computer - all interconnect wirelessly . after download the latest firmware and installation software , I spend three hour attempt to get the print server to communicate with the printer . despite my best effort , I could only communicate to the print server via usb . print server do not even show up on the home network . assume I must have overlook a important step , I contact , via email , Netgear tech support . the extent of they support in to send the same set on instruction - it be clearly evident that one one actually read my email . follow the instruction to the letter - several time over but to no avail . I finally send a email thank they for they support but I be throw the server away and send a copy of the email trail to they ceo Pat Lo . receive another form email say how they regret when bad thing happen to they best customer and they hope to do better next time I purchase a Netgear boat anchor . after spend over six hour work on this miserable device , it do feel liberating when I toss it in the can .
GPS	POS	5	my husband and I just buy a Pontoon Boat for fishing and pleasure . we both enjoy fishing so we want to get some good equipment to go along with the boat and this unit be highly recommend . it may even be more than we need right now because it be `` load '' with all kind of good thing . the graphic be easy to read and clear . the depth finder with alarm be very helpful . even when the sun be shine on the screen , it be clear and easy to read . the sonar give a real wide angle of what be below we and in great detail . this unit have more map than we will ever use , but it be good to know they be there should we decide to hit some other fishing area . we boat dealer be kind enough to instll this unit on the boat for we and the hookup they use move it in all different direction and allow we to remove it easily before trailer the boaot home and pop it on when we be ready to hit the water . I do not see how anyone could be disappoint with this unit . my husband , who be not a `` Techie '' -lrb- have problem run a computer -rrb- have learn very quickly how to operate this unit . we love it . we highly recommend it . when I have a couple of question , support from Humminbird be excellent too !
GPS	POS	5	this be one of the best gp we have purchase so far . the info about speed limit as we drive along the interstate particularly be a great feature . thanks .
GPS	POS	4	I like the 76 that I buy several year ago so much that I want another in the same series when I upgrade . this be so much quicker , and it have so many new feature , especially greatly increase memory , and it cost considerably less than the 76S . the one thing I have find lack be that the tide feature the 76 have only come with another $ 120 + of marine software for the 76CSX . we live near salt water and it add to the usefulness when we be camp if we know what the tide be do . be there anyway I can download this into my new GPS ?
GPS	POS	5	if you buy a Garmin 60Cx , you need this to protect a great gp !
GPS	POS	5	this be a first rate geocach hand unit . I have have great success locate geocach with this fabulous gp unit . I be now able to maintain satellite signal in any location , even in my house . I recommend purchase City Navigator software to be install in this unit and this make this gp unit the total package . I give it five star for performance and user friendly control .
GPS	NEG	1	too much money for the real value that you will get back . it can take 15-20 minute to get satellite signal , intersection nor detailed like in tom-tom . I really want to re-sell it for half the price but nobody want this gp , money on the trash .
GPS	POS	5	Works great . very accurate gp . I like the soft rubber on the chest band . fit better than the Nike or Polaris I try . just wish it be a little cheaper .
GPS	POS	5	my first GPS , which I get because I would be drive in Italy , and believe I , and my rental car passenger , this turn out to be a life-saver . we would have miss a hundred turn -lrb- the round-about be especially hard to navigate by eyesight alone , as they sometimes have several exit with small or no sign that whiz by in this italian mixmaster traffic -rrb- , and some rural location , like b&b; s , be simply off the marked road . enter a town , road or street and a number , and it 'll take you there , or if it do not have one , punch in coordinate from the host . also , after read some review of other gpss , I be surprise to see how well the unit perform in city in pedestrian mode , regardless of high building , as the `` Hotfix '' feature quickly pick up any lose signal -lrb- this be true even in longish tunnel in northern Italy -rrb- . the four-hour battery be great for out-of-vehicle use . also , review for other model complain how long it take to get satellite fix and map load on arrival in the foreign country , but this gp get they up in about a minute . the Italy map be very detailed and the restaurant\/points of interest\/fuel stop nearby feature very quick and accurate . conversion from mph to KPH be simple and the many other feature be easy and intuitive , too . I be not a techie at all , but I can use this device very well . one more thing : tech service . I get help for update map because I be not very technical , and a very nice and helpful agent be on the phone with I in less than 5 minute .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin Zumo 220 GPS be simply the perfect Navi System for motorcycle on the market right now ...
GPS	POS	5	I have have this gp for almost two year and use it every day . it work exactly as it be suppose to work . I use the weighted dash holder - not the windshield mount . I also add a sd card to backup my address , but I have never have to resort to this . it be very user friendly , and everyone in the family have no trouble use it . one time I have a problem get get reception . I contact tech support and quickly receive some advice that work right away . -lrb- it turn out that dust can collect in the antenna attachment - I be tell to just pull it off , blow on the connection , and replace it . Voila - satellite connection be restore ! -rrb- other than that , I have have no problem with my unit . the only two issue that would make this gp better would be to have it smaller and to have a internal battery . however , even with these drawback , it be a great gp , and my entire family have be very happy with it .
GPS	POS	5	I be a person that will research online and at the store and this be the best gp I have see . I be about to order the Garmin c330 until I check it out at a local electronics store . the salesperson show I how simple it be to use and I pick it up quickly . when I tell he how cool this thing be and that my mind be make up on the c330 , he say `` wait , check this out '' and show I the c340 . this one actually speak the name of the street instead of left or right at the next corner . it may not seem like much , but the whole reason for buy a gp be to have you hand hold as you drive . since I do not intend to buy another , I spring for the extra $ 70 buck . this puppy be a pleasure to use . I be a field technician so this save I time and fuel when go from one place to another . its especially helpful when I be call to go someplace I have never be before and I do not need to ask direction or refer to Mapquest . I simply pull over from where ever I be , key in the address and I be off . once its save , I can always return to it . my wife have always tell I I get lose after pull out of we driveway , but never again . its size also make it convenient for when I be fly out of state and have to rent a car . you will not be disappoint .
GPS	POS	4	just get this unit yesterday with the expectation that the bluetooth `` broadcast navigation and phone call through you car stereo '' like the description say on the amazon page ... come to find out this be not true . Amazon should edit that description so nobody else will be mislead . it come out of a weak speaker build into the GPS itself and the microphone sound muffle to those on the other end of the call . . other than that , so far so good .
GPS	POS	5	I be a fan of the Hertz Magellan Neverlost system , but the bi-modal review of the Magellan Systems give the impression that there be prodcution quality issue . next , I be go to go for the Garmin 2720 . it can be fit with dead reckoning , but need wiring to the car . review make I realize , my main reason for buy a gp be not to use on my car , but on business trip and hence rental car . so portability be key , and the Nuvi have the best form factor . to lug a 2720 -lrb- with laptop , file etc -rrb- on business trip would make thing just the bit more heavy . in addition to the good point give by other reviewer , I must say the mount be excellent . it stick well and because the Nuvi be so light , the mount do not have a lot to do to stick there . also , the cigarette lighter power can cleverly be plug straight into the mount and not the unit . to mount the Nuvi , you have only to flip the antenna up -lrb- activate the gp -rrb- and clip it on . it power up straight away . then , when you get out , all you have to do , be press a small clasp release on the mount and out pop the Nuvi . it even switch itself off after 30 seconds . you can also put the Nuvi in `` search mode '' . while drive on the free way look for food or lodging , you only have to press `` where to '' and then press say `` lodging '' . the Nuvi give you a list of hotel , motel , hostel near you . it also provide distance and arrow show whether they be ahead or behind you current position . the list update itself every few minute as you move along . see something you like ? just press it and the `` go '' button and Nuvi take you there . it be a life saver when we be travel long distance late at night and need somewhere convenient to stay . finally , this be one gadget that my wife love . when on holiday , she invariably end up the navigator . its stressful for she and thing get heat up when I make a wrong turn require difficult new instruction on what to do . Nuvi have change all that . she just sleep through , as the Nuvi announce its `` recalculate '' the route . but indeed , you don `` t get a map which you can load on you pc , there be apparently no way to plan\/alter route on the Nuvi prior to make a trip or to keep a record of you trip . Garmin have be excellent in address user feedback , so I be hopeful . BTW , I do not use the other function such as mp3\/calculator and would prefer the functionality on the GPS be improve rather than these function . but that be just I since I still use a pda .
GPS	POS	5	this product work great . it be not too bulky and get great reception . the only thing be that it do not get satelite when you be indoors but that be expect unless you need drive direction from you garage to you living room . the touch screen be great and the button be large enough to touch while drive . the speakers\/voice be loud and clear . the feature be great and the poi be pretty extensive . searching for the poi take roughly a minute or two but they be good enough . you can always update you maps\/pois for free once you have register the product . overall , I really think this be a good decision .
GPS	POS	4	this be a nice unit . I especially like the large screen size and the 20 gig hard drive . I have down-load many album onto the 10 gig set aside for mp3 music and use this feature constantly on trip . use the gp require some investment in time study the manual and experiment with the different trip option that be available until it become second nature . the unit come with user friendly and efficient mount hardware . on hot sunny day it be sometimes necessary to turn on the a\/c and set it to blow through the defroster vent to cool the unit . this be no problem though since the unit will tell you when it be get too hot . I have no regret about buy Lowrance .
GPS	POS	5	buy this for my husband , and now go place be no longer a concern . we would get direction from either a person or mapquest and they might not be accurate and get lose be frustrating . this take all of the worry out of travel . I have already recommend this to my family and friend . never leave home without it .
GPS	POS	5	I be reluctant to buy a portable gp system but after much research include discussion with Garmin sale reps. I decide to take a chance on the c330 . right out of the box , this device prove to live up to the manufacturer 's representation and after be road-test in Omaha , NJ , NY and Florida , I be now convince this be , without a doubt , one of the best device -lrb- gp and otherwise -rrb- that I have ever own . thank you Garmin for make my travels safer and my life less stressful when drive .
GPS	POS	5	for several year , I have envy the owner of high end car equip with navigation system . I consider get a aftermarket in-dash system , but the price be too steep . the StreetPilot III Deluxe be just what I have be look for . it be a reliable , well-designed , and just plain fun gadget that will please the electronics junkie and the casual user alike .  the high resolution screen be gorgeous and remain clearly visible even in bright sunlight . at sundown -lrb- automatically calculate by the StreetPilot -rrb- , the display switch to black and white and can still be read easily without distract the driver . operation be very easy once you get the hang of it . the 128 mb datum card include with the deluxe version can store map cover a radius of 500 + mile . it should be adequate for almost all trip . program the card be fairly easy , although the software be probably the system 's weakest link . the interface be poorly design but functional .  the system 's autorouting function work very well , but because it can not account for traffic volume or terrain , it sometimes underestimate drive time and thus do not choose the quickest route . 95 % of the time , however , the system choose the best route , and it have identify new and better direction for several of my most common trip . the vocal prompt be excellent . a sophisticated trip computer be a include feature and be a welcome addition if you car do not have one .  I can not praise the StreetPilot highly enough . in many way , I think it be superior to a in-dash system , in term of price and portability -lrb- since you can transfer the device between car -rrb- . it be the rare gadget that be both useful and fun . you 'll wonder how you ever live without it .
GPS	POS	5	I use this to keep track of my two dog while they be off lead in the wood . it do a great job . when they go off chase whatever , you can see where they be relative to yourself and if need be you can go after they since you know the direction to take . it be very accurate at show they location . great job Garmin . my only complaint be that the track on the handheld seem to be position towards the bottom of the screen instead of the center . it give I total confidence to have they off lead so that if they get lose or hurt I will be able to find they . just a reminder , remember to re-calibrate the handheld when you change the battery . it be a very simple procedure but I forget about it and think there be something wrong with the unit . re-calibration solve the problem .
GPS	POS	4	overall this have nice feature and easy to use . have good battery life and the only thing I wish that be better be the map feature show you course . other wise I be very happy with my purchase
GPS	NEU	3	this be my third TomTom . they have all be pretty good . this latest one have a great screen . the magnetic mount be a little hard to get use to , I be not completely there yet , but it do hold the device securely . the lane assist be very good . as I say I have have 2 other TomTom 's and 1 Garmin . I prefer the TomTom over the Garmin in most category except one . the point of interest feature of the TomTom really stink . the Garmin be far superior in this respect . navigate the pous menu on the TomTom be tedious , confusing , and when you give up and decide to spell what you be look for it `` can not be find '' . I sit in front of a Kohl 's department store and search for it and TomTom could not find it . in another instance it send I to another state , by ferry boat , to a Walmart , when there be one right down the road . buy the TomTom be a no-brainer because of the lifetime map and traffic feature but I see now where other be start to offer this also . overall this be a nice device but if when travel the pous feature be important to you I can not recommend this product . if you be look for a device to simply get you there efficiently this may be for you .
GPS	POS	4	you should buy a gp system base on 1 primary criterion , accuracy of direction . the Pioneer system be fast and provide logical direction without constantly provide needless information . beware of off brand , they can give you illegal direction . I test a cheap mio handheld and be be direct to make left turn when you be require to make a right and use a jug handle . this mistake cause potential traffic accident and longer than necessary trip when be reroute . the PIO feature be nice , but I do not use it as often as expect . the bluetooth speaker option be awesome , and worth at least $ 100 for the safety factor .
GPS	POS	4	I will apologize for the long review to follow -lrb- I usually try to keep it to one screen -rrb- . over the past three year I have use three different gp unit from three different manufacturer . I think a side by side comparison might be useful . the technology continue to advance , as do the feature set offer in the way of traffic reporting\/rerouting and map update , so I will try to stick the general feature set\/usability of each unit unless it pertain to a feature that I can not see buy a gp without . the three GPS unit be a Motorola Motonav TN765T , TomTom XL 350TM and Garmin Nuvi 760 . Motorola Motonav TN765T pro : \* best screen resolution of the three \* fast trip calculation\/recalculation and voice input or destination be a great feature \* best overall display and on screen information content pertain to speed , direction , etc. . - light weight - plenty of expansion feature -lrb- at a cost -rrb- - 2d or 3d map render - phone Bluetooth integration be easy to setup - satellite lock be fast and stable con : - the mount be wonderfully articulate , so that you can mount and adjust it to you heart 's content , but it vibrates\/jiggles constantly in my car so that it make it hard to read the display - Motorola decide to place a couple of control on the back of the unit , and I find that I be constantly trigger they while adjust the unit - can you say advertisement ? I know you could - traffic information be often slow to load or incorrect -lrb- either I be already fifteen minute into a delay when it finally load , or it report a delay on a stretch of highway that be completely open -rrb- , but the TomTom and Garmin be no better - use with Bluetooth next to useless , even with the top up and window close my Miata be too noisy to make this usable -lrb- all of these gp unit rate the same in this respect , so I will not bother to repeat this -rrb- - limited map update -lrb- I think it be 6 month or less -rrb- - the accompany software never work successfully on my Windows 7 64bit system -lrb- maybe they have remedy this by now , at the time Windows 7 have just come out and Motorola be apparently not concern as they support personnel never respond to my contact -rrb- TomTom XL 350TM pro : \* lifetime map update be very nice -lrb- update be restricted to quarterly -rrb- - interface be easy to navigate \* traffic monitor include -lrb- no ad or expiration -rrb- -lrb- however , it be still often wrong -rrb- \* plenty of poi , many available via download -lrb- on the con side , the parent company do not seem to maintain these pous list or the accompany graphic , go figure , you would think that Starbucks and McDonald 's would want you to know just where to find all of they location and be able to readily identify they from the little icon -rrb- - map color modification , though I have not be able to get it to look just like the Garmin , which I find to be the best of the bunch in they default setting - I like the on screen information content , the essential be there , but the Motorola rule this feature - accompany software work well con : - mount bracket be good but not great , I get the least vibration , but it often break loose on I , such that I need to verify the ring be rotate fully clockwise -lrb- a simple lock mechanism would have be a great addition -rrb- - I have be bite a couple of time by allow the unit to reroute I past delay , beware that it do not monitor surface street traffic -lrb- I try to bypass the local fair highway traffic only to have it reroute I onto the surface street that wind directly past the fair turn a 30 minute delay into a 90 minute delay -rrb- - satellite lock be often slow to connect when the unit be turn on , especially in cloudy weather and can lose lock if the weather be poor - limited set of downloadable voice and vehicle avatar -lrb- unless you be willing to pay -rrb- Garmin Nuvi 760 pro : \* simplest interface , intuitive , require little or no documentation to get start use the device \* the mount bracket be by far the most secure with the least vibration and the easiest to fasten and remove the unit - best set of downloadable feature from voice to vehicle avatar , most free - accompany software work well con : - no map update - 3 month free traffic information , then you pay to subscribe to the free information -lrb- I see that both of these item be available in the newer version of the Garmin product -rrb- - while I prefer the default color scheme of the Garmin , the overall graphic display on this devise be below the minimal display I would expect from a GPS now overall impression : I find the Garmin to be the easiest to use and I notice that the current version include many of the feature that I find preferable in the other manufacturer 's model . I currently use the TomTom as the most functional of the unit that I currently own , however , if I be to buy a new unit at this time , I would opt for a Garmin base upon my experience with the above unit . p - -rrb-
GPS	POS	4	I have use a mio c310x for awhile before my son take it from I to leave for college , so I experience use a GPS Nav enough to understand and appreciate all aspect of the review by ` the Shadows ' . it be a honest , expertise and comprehensive one . I be about to buy one , though I do not like the TomTom one not to have phone number of poi that the mio do abundantly . Victor .
GPS	NEG	1	Magellan Roadmate 800 . this product should be ship directly from the manufacturer to the garbage dump . I recently use this to go from Eugene , or to Lake Tahoe , CA . the error , misdirection , and mis-routing on this one trip be far too numerous to list here . I will give 3 for you amusement . 1 . while go South on Interstate 5 it insist that I be go East . 2 . while sit in the Wal-Mart parking lot in Red Bluff , CA , I ask it to direct I to the nearest Wal-Mart . it tell I that it be 163 mile south . 3 . on my return to Eugene it route I through Placerville , which be fine . except once I get to Placerville it route I off the freeway and through several street and back onto the freeway , go in the opposite direction ... twice ! also , you can forget about find a rest stop on you way , it will route you 20 mile in the opposite direction when one be actually just a few mile up the road . save you $ 600 , buy a roadmap and a magnifying glass ...
Projector	NEG	2	this be absolutely not a fit for Optoma hd20 . I do not know how it fit other projector , but if you have hd20 look somewhere else . the mount assembly be too big for the tiny optoma and it be too hard to fit it in . if you try the centroid method the manual suggest , its nearly impossible to align the hole to match . once you put it together and mount it on the ceiling , it will still have some tiny wobble and adjust to fit the screen be quite a task . tighten the bolt do not really help so much . the only good thing be that the piece that attach to the ceiling be very strong and well build . in general , remember to loosen the bolt before hoist it on the ceiling . you will have to oil the bolt and put a lot of strength to loosen they . they be terribly tight . Stay away from it if you have a hd20 !
Projector	POS	4	I see this pj in action last night . the source be a Sony BluRay dvd player and a br press of Spiderman 2 . the picture clarity be amazing . Rock solid image with -lrb- not surprisingly -rrb- incredible definition . I can not , however give it 5 star . perhaps the color calibration be not perfect -lrb- altough Sony rep be on hand so `` they bad '' if they set it up poorly -rrb- - in particular the red be far too prominent . this be a 3 chip , native 1920x1080 unit , so no color wheel and , hence , no rainbow effect . it also run super quiet -lrb- again , no wheel -rrb- and push surprisingly little air out of the read-ported vent . the air that be come out \* be \* pretty hot , so any room that host this bad boy should have good ventilation . it be a attractive unit and , steal from Apple , the `` sony '' logo be rear-lit when the unit be turn on . the screen be a pretty small Stewart Filmscreens Greyhawk , so contrast ratio be additionally boost . due to the small size , the image be exceptionally bright . at this resolution , it be interesting to note how clearly computer generate the Spiderman scene appear . on sd unit , there be enough softening of the edge to hide the cg nature of the image and complete the illusion . at hidef re , however , the blue-screen and cg become quite obvious . Hollywood Actors\/Actresses : beware ! you wrinkle and blemish will soon be splash they way across 120 '' hidef screen all over the world ! : -rrb- at under $ 9k for a 3-chip dlp , Sony have really throw down the gauntlet with this one . expect competitor to follow and hopefully we 'll all be able to afford something of this spec within just a few more year .
Projector	POS	5	wow this thing be fantastic !!! I love it !!! just get do watch the supper bowel with Family and freind in my man cave , the projector exceed my expectation ! wife and I also watch a movie on it last night . you cant go wrong for the price !
Projector	NEU	3	I be finally able to get the projector work with my MacBook -lrb- run Lion -rrb- after the support team send I the latest driver for the usb link . this process be quite frustrating yet I must say the fix work the first time . overall ok for customer service . pro : - display be very bright - the ability to adjust color be important as well and intuitive . - menu be simple and intuitive . - once customer support be actually engage , it work well . con : - I have a great deal of difficulty with initial installation with my MAC - despite the claim of ` it work right out of the box ' it do not . os x Lion have be out for over a year - why be they ship with a old driver ? - video playback for YouTube and DV file from my hard drive be choppy . the frame rate support by the projector be far from ideal . I find it quite noticeable . when I look at the computer screen the playback remain clear and chop-free . not sure what the issue be here , but this be a definite detractor . I need to test with a dvd and see if this be true for that as well . I will update when that test be complete . Update on pay a dvd from my MacBook : the dvd screen be a mass of gray and white square - no picture of the movie at all . I email customer support for assistance . - customer support get right back to I - which be great , but the the advice be to use the VGA cable to fix the issue I have . this show a basic lack of understanding of my system . MacBook do not support VGA cable , so they advice be useless . - customer support once again reply a couple of day later and advise I to purchase a adapter for the VGA cable to ensure that dvd playback on the MacBook would function properly . once again , I find this a less than desirable solution . it be not like mac be ` strange ' - VGA be old technology , it be time to update people ! I be reduce my review to three-stars base on this experience . overall - for the price - a very solid projector for business application . I can not recommend it at this point for entertainment application as the video playback be simply not up to par .
Projector	POS	5	nice picture size over 8 foot so be prepare for large work area need to enjoy the full view , all , connect be secure simple set up and operation .
Projector	POS	5	excellent project with enough brightness in the room with window . all function be work well as describe by Panasonic . Lighting remote control be helpful in dark room . it be definitely worth $ $ $ $ you pay for this project .
Projector	POS	5	I buy the hc4000 as a replacement for it be older brother hc3800 -lrb- damage in a lightning strike -rrb- ... the family line have a good gene pool - super price\/performance value
Projector	POS	4	very good Projector . have it for a month now and very happy with it . have a little problem in the begin to set it up with nvida 3d vision on my pc -lrb- mostly because of my lack of experience in the area -rrb- but manage to do it after 4 day . only down side be the beep noise when turn on and of and the fact that the on screen menu have no option to be more transparent . January 02 2012 : have it for almost a year now and still work fine
Projector	POS	5	we make a outdoor entertainment area at the back end of we property where two very large tree fall and form a natural amphitheater . on a Tori gate between the two tree , I mount a seven foot screen so we could watch movie use a projection system I buy from Amazon and a extra stereo receiver and surround sound system . it be great but the screen be just not big enough for the area so I purchase this ten foot one . WOW , what a difference . we have have four movie night so far and everybody want to come . I want a manual , pull down , screen because I have to take it down and store it after every movie . this one seem to be well make . it pull down and raise very easily . I use a blu-ray player to show the movie and the picture be as least as good as the big screen tv in the house . -lrb- it be about four year old -rrb- Phoenix be warm enough to have movie night all winter long , with a fire pit anyway . spring and fall be absolutely perfect ... during July through September , I be go to have to figure a way to mount it so we can watch movie from the pool .
Projector	POS	5	OMG !!!! that be all I can say ! this be the best projector I have ever use ! I be a teacher and where I teach , they use the Epilson . it be a great projector but very pricely . I have read all of the other review because I be skepitical about buy a product without ue a demonstration . this projector be not only affordable but be great ! I laugh at the comment that say if you do not like high quality brightness -lrb- or something like that -rrb- this be not for you . well he be right ! this projector be so bright and colorful that you can watch it with the light on . it just need minor adjustment . I be soooooo glad I do not purchase a flat screen television or a big screen television . it be such a waste of money . I still have mine from 10 year ago that still work great . I do not use it now . I connect the Vivitek to my cable wire and watch cable tv , it be connect to my dvd player for movie , and I highly recommend it for the new Xbox kinect usage !!! awesome !!!!!!!!! the only problem be ... it get hot and the fan can be loud for a short period of time . if you have the stereo surround system , then do not worry , the volume will override the noise . that be it !!! buy it and enjoy it !
Projector	POS	5	I purchase this mount after read the review for use this mount with a Epson 8350 . I take the advice of other in order to locate the balance point of the mount . also , like other , I be only able to use 3 of the 5 mount hole . however , I be able to mount the projector and it work very well . it take a little adjust to get it level and solid but I be able to do it . I do want to use all 5 mount as I want to be sure the projector be securely hold . I find the Atdec website and send a message to customer service ask how I would go about purchase two additional long extension . I be very pleasantly surprise when the customer service representative reply that he would send they to I no charge if I would provide my address . now that be outstanding customer service !!!! highly recommend this mount !
Projector	NEG	1	this be only a very basic item and not intend for use to project for even medium size audience . the light be very weak and have difficulty project much further than 8 foot .
Projector	POS	5	very sturdy and solid construction . mount to a Dell 2400 projector be a little bit tricky because the projector only have one hole and I think this mount be for three hole . anyway , I figure it out and now it just sit there hold up the projector . the wall mount screw be a bit long - I use some shorter one that work better . I be happy with this product and would buy it again .
Projector	POS	5	I use this for movie night outside on a 9 ` x16 ' screen make out of blackout cloth purchase on here from Carl 's place . you would be about 27 ' from the screen and the color and clarity through my blu-ray player be UNBELIVEABLE . there be no overheating or blur like other have say . I use a 720p Vivitek projector and this one blow it away . you will not be disappoint . the on board speaker be ok but I hook up my own surround sound . buy with confidence .
Projector	NEG	1	install the bulb and when I turn on the video I be disappointed beam illuminate very little , I do not recommend this bulb , never ever buy .
Projector	NEG	1	too bad the excellent electronics and picture be totally cancel out by a bulb that do not last as advertise . Epson tout 4000 hour lamp life , but it be a BIG lie ! first bulb last 660 hour , die after the 90 day warranty on the bulb , but be replace under a secret extension to the warranty by Epson . second bulb last 700 hour , but the overall 2 year warranty be up , so tough luck . so , two bulb , 25 month of service , 1360 hour . you need to figure a new $ 270 bulb for each year of life when you calculate the cost to operate this pj .
Projector	POS	4	I buy this as a Christmas present for my husband who love electronics . Use will be for gaming with the Wii -lrb- until we kid we older and he get that PS3 or XBox he want -rrb- , and movie blue-ray\/dvd watch purpose . my kid be thrill with the idea of a `` movie theater '' in we game room . I be impress with the picture for the price I pay , and no , it be not hd , but it be pretty cool if you ask I -lrb- as a electronics novice -rrb- . he say , great picture , very bright . some difficulty in find the component to VGA cable - it must be order off the internet . right now , he be just use what come with , and be still fairly happy with it . Picture be pretty clear even with three window in we game room - even better in the dark\/at night . we be very pleased with the product , for the price . he have no idea what I pay for it , but seem very impressed . rate lower ease of set up due to find cable , etc. but if you know ahead of time what to order , you should be fine .
Projector	POS	5	this product give many different option of installation it be simple and easy to install . I be very happy with the quality . thanks , Avi Moyal http:\/\/www.kabbalah.info
Projector	POS	4	I be pleasantly surprise at this unit . it be not perfect , but for what it be it be great . first , the picture , and most important part of this unit . the picture be great . sure it be not as god as a big display unit , but for its compact size it work great . unfortunately there be not any picture control that I could find except for focus , so the picture you get be what you get . color be a little dull , but that might have to do with the darkness in the room too . it also have a build in speaker which be not the loudest , but better than nothing . you can always connect external speaker . the focus dial be great and I be able ego get the image very crisp at a large size , and smaller one . the unit itself be very light . definitely build for on the go . it have a little pop out stand that really do not raise the unit much and be almost useless . the include tripod be much better and work great once you get the leg at the right angle . the lack of extra feature make it very easy to use with on\/off\/volume controls\/focus , and that be about it . it do get warm pretty fast so you do want to use the tripod . it come with a bunch of accessory include outlet for various plug type , video cable , a case . you can use the VGA cable to connect you computer which also have a audio plug connect to it , so no need to have a separate cable . I also try the iPod\/iPad connector and it work fantastic . I be even able to play purchase video from iTunes , which I do not expect . I be not sure if every model come with the connector or if it be a extra buy on . while this unit be pricey , it be cheaper than a full size unit and definitely perfect for the person on the go with the light weight . this really be a nice unit .
Projector	POS	4	I hide this screen in my crown molding and it work great . it keep the wall clean for artwork . Easy to install and remote work well too . overall exceptional product for the price . the only issue I have be the screen be make for 9 ' ceiling and I have a 12 ' ceiling . I be still try to figure out how to lower the screen 3 more foot . I might even have to find another screen that roll down longer . I welcome any suggestion . I be not afraid to void the warranty on this product . overall you can not beat the price for what you get .
Projector	NEG	1	I do not know if the problem be with the accessory kit or my projector , but I still have problem get my Iphone 4 to work with my Optoma projector .
Projector	NEG	2	basic construction and design leave a lot to be desire . do not fit larger projector use in most media room today .
Projector	POS	5	this product be perfect for someone that travel a lot to meeting and seminar . it be light weight , compact and provide for projection of multiple component .
Projector	POS	5	I be very satisfied with this purchase . product be a good value and arrive in excellent condition . I review many brand and model and select the Epson 705HD base on performance and budget . anything better would have be twice the price . my family and I be enjoy movie on the big screen .
Projector	NEG	2	order this projector after read good review here and elsewhere . initially I be quite impressed by the image quality , very decent 720p image that match my expectaion . however , about 9 month into use , the projector start develop bad pixel . I make the obviouse mistake of not return it on the spot for a in-warranty repair . initially just a few ... but the situation deteriorate over time . I be now about 18 month from first use and the device be unusable ; there be over 100 bad pixel -lrb- mostly white -rrb- plus a `` bad '' black line run across at about 2\/3 the screen . obviously there be something significantly wrong with the reliability of the dlp device use in this design ... I have contact customer support ... look forward to they reply . Update May-31-12 : have return the unit to Optoma for repair - they gracefully accept this as a `` in warranty repair '' even though technically out of the guarantee 12-month period . good expereince ... make I comfortable of purchase optoma product in the future .
Projector	POS	4	I recently purchase the Sony vlphw30ae -lrb- vlphw30 series 3d with transmitter and 2 pair of 3d glass -rrb- . as a previous owner of a Sony vplvw60 1080p 24 frame projector I have high video standard and expectation . this be say , I be not sure what to expect give the lower price point and how a 3d optimize picture would stack up in 2d mode . I be quite impressed with the fast start up time and the very deep black level of the vlphw30ae . the manual zoom and focus take some get use to but work fine . the 3d pictue on this relatively low cost projector be quite impressive , very bright and detailed with super deep black level . 2d detail for 1080p 24 frame fall a little short compare to the vplvw60 but not by much , give the vplvw60 be twice the price and 50 % heavier I be not disappoint . the remote backlight work great , all advance function be there . still try to figure out the best cinema mode , the low lamp mode be plenty bright for my need . I rate this high , 8.5 ~ 9.0 out of 10 the Amazon service and shipping time be great , well packed and with all the accessory !
Projector	POS	5	Universal , easy to install and quite stable . install last year , it move about 1 inch in one year , so I adjust it in one second . actually it could be my home that move ... it be the best quality \/ price item that I could find and I be very happy I buy it instead of have the projector at reach for the kid .

Projector	POS	5	yes , you need a dark room and white backdrop , but it be awesome . i put this in my bedroom hook up to Dish and to my computer . i play blu ray through it from my pc on arcsoft tmt or powerdvd and it look great . you have to put it on video mode and it will look good . i have it at about 140 '' and it look great . i have 7.1 audio and that with this projector play a bd make my room feel like a personal cinema . dark movie like harry potter 7 part one look fine but you must adjust the lighting in TMT to get it bright enough to see everything . it be very good for only be 170 buck . it be all i need to have for now , i love it . plus like i say , it hook up to my dish tv so i watch tv on it and it be better by far than my tv . I would say if you want a big screen and dont want to waste a thousand buck on a full hd lead flatscreen get this for a 170 buck and have a 140 '' screen everyone will love !!!
Projector	NEG	2	I wish I have see the `` costly mistake '' review before I buy my 8100 in Feb. . I , too see the concern about `` beta '' unit , and discount they . well , I be initially a very satisfied buyer . this be the second projector I have own , the first be a Panasonic 720P pt ax200u . the 8100 be a big improvement over that one in picture quality , perceive brightness , etc. , as it should be , be several year newer technology and 1080p resolution . for 600 hour and 5 month , I be happy . then all of a sudden , the bulb severely dim . I spend the next 5 minute check various setting , hope to make this go away so we can finish watch the movie we be streaming from Amazon , then POP -lrb- loud -rrb- go my bulb , like the old-school flashbulb of yore , scare the \* ^ -lrb- \* ^ out of I and my wife . the next day , I check my warranty information , and discover that the advertised 4000 hour bulb be only warranteed for 90 day . my bad , should have read the fine print . I go online and find out that I be not alone , other have be experience this same kind of premature failure , and there be hint that Epson be `` extend '' the 90 day in the interest of customer service . so , I try the Epson `` direct customer line '' card provide with my projector , only to find the pin the supply on the card be not valid . ok , I spend my dime and call the support toll number . I describe my problem to the 1st level support specialist , and he instantly transfer I to a `` projector bulb specialist '' who take my info . and with no argument agree to send I a replacement bulb , after walk I through the extraction procedure -lrb- little bit of glass rain down on I in the process , as it be ceiling mount -rrb- . ok , I say , I be a satisfied customer , but kind of worried about the next bulb 's life . three day later , the bulb arrive , it be the WRONG one . I call support , same drill , this time they keep I on the hold for a long time , then transfer I to a `` customer relation '' specialist . she proceed to tell I that Epson policy be that they can not send I the correct replacement until they receive the wrong one back , and that I can not return it until they send I a return label . I say , wait a minute , this be you fault , not mine , I be not happy about this , my projector will be down a week , be not there someone who can authorize a expedited replacement , you can take my credit card # for security ? no , she say , due to the value of the bulb , it be company policy , and that be that . five day later , I finally get the return label , which be send regular US Mail , and it be for regular ground shipment , not even expedite . take 3 more day for they to get it , and then they do Fedex Next Day the replacement , but after the cutoff , so I finally get the replacement more than two week after the failure . it work so far , but who know how long it will last , or if they 'll replace another one after more time . have to be without live room entertainment for 2 week , and deal with service that do not care about customer satisfaction or even get the part #s right be not that entertaining , either . probably the last Epson product I 'll ever buy . my 3 1\/2 year old Panasonic projector be still go strong , install elsewhere , on it be first bulb , after 3000 hour , ironically .
Projector	NEG	1	try to use this projector this week to put a slideshow onto a wall at a trade show . turn off all spot light in the stand and the hall be not very brightly light ; even so , most of the slide be not readable as the projector be just too weak of a output . not suitable for this application . it might work in a totally dark room but be not usable when there be even a small amount of ambient light .
Projector	POS	5	thank you ... thank you SONY , really I could not believe my eye , it be a theater yes ... when I turn off the light the picture i have see be great . . the sharpness look like a 3d , it do not matter if you see the movie on the wall or on screen . this product be wonderfull , thanks to SONY the one and the only .
Projector	POS	5	just get this unit have be use a infocus x1 follow that up with a x2 but still miss the clarity and color I want in satellite tv viewing as well as dvd and VCR view . the optoma 719 upgrade my x2 from 800 x 600 up to a eye pop 780P\/1024 x 768 resolution that be nothing less than spectacular video viewing . I use a flat wall surface prepared and paint with `` Screen Goo '' -lrb- tm -rrb- and that be it . the room be light by one 25 watt -lrb- fridge -rrb- light bulb , provide plenty of light to still move around in a room area roughly 14 ' x 25 ' located in a basement area with window block . this be better than the movie theater . the color and clarity , resoultion of this projector with the new Texas Instruments DLP dark chip 2 be incredible for the same price as a much lesser resolution x1 or x2 from InFocus . do not get I wrong I really enjoy my x2 projector and it be great for gaming but for the serious dvd\/tv in hd viewer you can not do much better than this . contrast ration be fantastic as well as amount of lumen for the buck . the thing be so light weight that I be timid take it out of the box . this be a great bargin in a time when auto fuel be a king ' ransom .
Projector	POS	5	Easy to install : I use two white metal chain link -lrb- about 1 1\/2 '' long heavy link -rrb- on each side , pass through the mount hole . then I use two white ceiling hook , place at the proper diatance , one for each side . I buy they at Lowe 's and they be specially easy to use , as you do not have to drill any hole or look for stud , just screw they into the ceiling plaster and they anchor themselves and support up to 60 lb each . next I hang the two chain link to the hook on each side and the work be do -rrb- . it take I several hour to think about this way of do it , but only 10 minute to install it . the screen be great and function well . I have and Epson 8500 UB and it be picture perfect .
Projector	POS	5	I love my Epson Powerlite s1 . I use it regularly for PowerPoint presentation in office setting and as a big screen tv in we home theater . for PowerPoint it do a tremendous job , provide clean , crisp image . for home theater the room can not be too bright in order to see all of the detail , but that be a small concession to make for a projector that offer ease of use , very good quality , affordable replacement bulb price , and enough power to get the job do - all for under $ 1000 . very tough to beat this deal !
Projector	POS	4	very good quality and value for money fifa10 be a pleasure to watch sometime rainbow effect be visible
Projector	POS	5	I will say this without any hesitation , I have not have a single problem with my projector and I have have it for 6 year . when I see so many people say they have bulb problem , I can not help but to think that they must be turn the projector off without allow it to cool . at the moment , I be at 2943 hour and I have have no issue what so ever . I allow the fan to cool the bulb before I turn it off . that be so crucial . the picture quality be great , especially in hd . I will not say it be as clean as a plasma screen tv , but if you have the space , you can have a screen that be big as any wall in you house . I build a screen that be 77 inch . the picture be stunning . the fan fade to the back as you be watch . it be quiet enough to forget it be on when you be watch a movie . the only issue I have with the projector be that the connection be odd . you have to find a 16 pin cable that connect to the rbg rca cable to connect to the dvd . most store do not carry these but you can find they on ebay . just for the record , this projector be great in my book . just follow the instruction in order to maintain the life of you bulb and you will be fine .
Projector	POS	5	this be a great buy for this quality . I have this setup in the basement with a 100 '' screen . wow what a difference especially with blu-ray movie . hd football be also super ! the position option allow lot of different placement and it be very quiet . this be the first piece of technology that have ever impressed my wife ! it be that good .
Projector	NEG	1	purchase this projector to use for a small project room setting . need to project power point presentation . the image be small and very blur . even the basic title page of the presentation be blurry . I return the projector and my search continue .
Projector	POS	4	I be worry when I read the review for this product . I own a Epson Home Cinema 8350 , after search a bit I find the extension piece -lrb- that should come with this mount , but it do not -rrb- :  VideoSecu White Projector mount extension adaptor only for brand VideoSecu Projector Mount W53  the 2 rod will not reach the right 2 hole . I purchase only 1 extra extension and it fit perfectly along with the 3 other rod in a 1 center , 2 leave , 1 right configuration . if you want a 2 left , 2 right configuration for the screw , I recommend buy two extension . either way make it quite stable . so far so good with the ceiling mount . it say it can hold up to 44lb . the 8350 be only 16lb , so we will see how it hold out . assembly be simple , need a philip screwdriver -lrb- not include -rrb- , and a Alan wrench -lrb- include -rrb- . good buy .
Projector	POS	5	just have to order my first replacement bulb for the 8100 , get 1750 hour out of it and have have no other issue whatsoever . as I be check for replacement bulb on Amazon I think I would check on the review for this projector and be surprise to find out about all the problem people have , especially with the bulb . I buy the unit in November of 09 -lrb- previously own a Panasonic -rrb- and have use it almost daily since then . set up be in the basement , good airflow , room temperature year round at about 68 degree . I clean the filter monthly , have not touch the fan yet , run in ECO mode at all time . under these condition I have have zero issue with the unit , and even though I actually feel that 1750 hour be a bit low -lrb- I get 2500 hour on the Panasonic -rrb- , see the complaint on here I guess I can count myself lucky . I would also mention that no one can ever seriously expect the hour on a lamp that a manufacturer estimate , 4000 hour be practically impossible to achieve , but I do expect around 2500 hour or so . have say that , I be overall extremely happy with the product and be wait for the replacement bulb to arrive soon . if any other issue arise , I will update .
Projector	POS	5	we have have the original for 5 year when this one finally give up the ghost . we use it for the purpose of theater entertainment and have serve we well . in the 5 year we use 2.5 lamp -lrb- 1\/2 use be still in the broken unit -rrb- . for the price it sure beat buy a 60 '' tv set , and we have a 120 '' screen . thanks for a great product .
Projector	POS	5	I do not think I can say enough about this product . for a installation , it be perfect . the unit do have a thin skin -lrb- be strike by Wii remote and no issue so far -rrb- . and be bulky for travel ; if you intend to use it in a installation it be great . I mount my from the ceiling and the throw be perfectly suit for this . my price be 644 and this be a steal deal for that . it be bright , able to use it in a room that get muted sunlight -lrb- closed white curtain -rrb- and unshielded -lrb- naked -rrb- light -lrb- 3 of they about 75 watt each -rrb- . only in dark scene do I see shadow on the screen from wall and such behind the projector . this be my everyday tv screen . I have it connect to dish hd -lrb- 1080i -rrb- and with it project to a width of 9 foot you will be awed . watch football will never be the same . I have use the speaker and while it be weak against my 1000 watt thx amplifier , it be perfectly suitable to hear in a reasonably quiet room . pro : bright , short throw , simple setup , 1080p , good value . con : no horizontal keystone , large , appear fragile , no DVI input .
Projector	POS	4	good enough and cheap , great for use at home ! I completely quote the second review ! enjoy this nice projector ! ; -rrb-
Projector	POS	5	the package be real long , but that be obvious consider the one I order be 120 '' ! the whole thing be in two part : the tripod portion and the screen portion . the tripod be a easy setup and the screen snap in with ease . the quality of the material be fine and it do not appear to have any flimsy part to it . this product be easy to setup and tear down -lrb- you can set it up and tear it down in a minute , seriously -rrb- . the white portion of the screen be bright and the screen material be good quality . I highly recommend this !
Projector	POS	5	I love this projector ! it give a very bright display and do not require absolute darkness . very easy to use feature , but impossible to use if you only have a computer with usb port . I have to get rid of my all-in - one to use it .
Projector	POS	5	but , you will want to get a outboard subwoofer to complete the package . I add the Yamaha YST-SW215 subwoofer to complete the bottom end . the proof be when I invite friend over to watch a good sound drive dvd tell they that the main home theater system in the basement theater be be use by my son and he friend . we watch and soon they be ask about the Yamaha sound bar and that it be produce better sound quality than they larger , less discrete home theater system that they own . the Yamaha sound bar be versatile and have all sort of setting that you can mess with to you heart 's or ear 's content . everything from basic output of a news talk program to a `` lush with audio '' dvd to a ipod connection for just plain music . there be setting to satisfy most anyone and those setting product rich sound that a flat paneled sound bar such as this one have no right to reproduce , yet do . to be fair , if you be look or listen for the bottom end , the sound bar itself will not do it , you must add a subwoofer as I mention above . the feedback calibration function be extremely useful in allow you to get dead-on adjustment for your room , not some industry average . I have a particularly odd set up in that the room have a cathedral ceiling and a partially open back end that flow into a galley kitchen . I pay much more for this when it first come out , it be now down in price significantly as there be higher model now available . this be a excellent unit for those of you who do not want or can not have discrete component due to setup or space limitation . Hang it just under you flat screen tv and you have get about as small a footprint as you be ever go to get with top notch sound to boot . grant , it do not possess the heft of my full home theater unit at 200w into 7 channel plus Hsu Research subwoofer ... BUT bang for the buck , this unit will not underwhelm you -lrb- just add the subwoofer , the Yamaha sub unit that I have work just fine and you can let it kick out when there be no sub content in the source ! -rrb- .
Projector	POS	4	this projector work great right out of the box . . hook up the Dish DRV , Xbox , Blu Ray and look great . Thought about a native 1080 , but for the half the price you can not go wrong . . throw a 140 '' image from 18 foot . . kid be happy and so be i. .
Projector	POS	4	this be a great alarm clock . Timex t740 make wake up a alot easier than you every day alarm clock . one of the great feature be a on board flash light that can come in handy during a power outage ... also soothing sound to wake up to .
Projector	POS	5	I read all the review on this product and get it anyway . it arrive right on time . take all the piece out of the box . all be in a neat package with all size in its own case . the instruction be ok but not the best . it do not take long to figure it out . spread out all the package of screw need and figure out what size we need . we size up all we angle and hole . look at the picture and move all the move part around to make the best fit and also enable we to screw all the part together without any interference . once we get the projector and bottom part together it be a simple matter of get to find out where the stud be in the ceiling , screw in the two screw to hold the top piece up and fitting the two piece together . take we about a hour total . we have the thing up and sit down to watch tv in a very short time . Fabulous . great piece of equipment . thanks .
Projector	POS	5	these be great projector ! high quality and last a long time ! Great for indoors and outdoor movie . I use it everywhere !
Projector	NEG	1	I buy this alarm clock for my husband for Christmas . we absolutely love everything about it until it just die . the display just go completely bonkers and be now stick on what look like 1:80 . and , the ONLY thing I do for that to happen be hit the snooze button . really ?!!? now , nothing work to fix it either . we try everything from unplug it , to take the battery in and out , it do no good !! I should of listen to the bad review and\/or buy it locally in store . now , I be face with the pain in the butt decision to I ship it back at MY expense and hope they fix it and\/or replace it with a new one which be asinine ! maybe I 'll just take the hit and learn my lesson the hard way and never buy another Timex again . regardless , it be a darn shame as we love Timex -lrb- at least they old alarm clock -rrb- in the past . my daughter have my old one from 2006 and my husband have one that be still work since he purchase it back in the early 90 's . what a bunch of crook , take people 's hard earn money , by use cheap part that be make overseas that will not last and\/or be defective from the get go !!! and , do not get I start on the LAME 90 day warranty that be pure b !! come on , really ?!!? if I know it come with only a 90 day warranty I would of never purchase this product . it also seem like Timex be not the only manufacturer that have major issue with they projection\/automatic date\/time set alarm clock either . buyer beware !! DO NOT buy !
Projector	POS	5	Compact and light weight , this be aim squarely at the travel business person who need to make presentation while travel , but it be also a handy general purpose projector , if you can accept a few limitation in exchange for the low price . pro : very compact , low price , excellent image quality , good color , good build quality , easy to use , good remote con : no hdmus input , remote not backlit the high lumen mean this projector be very bright and can be use in a room with a fair amount of ambient light . a step up from the 800x600 210 model , the 310 's 1024x768 resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio be fine for present and for dvd 's , gaming , and many video format . it be equivalent to 720p hd -- higher resolution than standard dvd video -lrb- 640x480 -rrb- and fine for streaming video , divx , home video , photo , and similar use . it be very well suit for laptop video game with a mid-level graphic card as well . you get Epson build quality and reliability , long bulb life , good out of the box color , instant on\/off , usb instant play -lrb- for photo , presentation , and pc display , but not suitable for video -rrb- , and VGA -lrb- good for pc Video and general display purpose -rrb- . you get vertical -lrb- but not horizontal , that be reserve for the more expensive 315 model -rrb- lens shift and lot of tweaking option -lrb- most of which you will not need -rrb- . this unit be very quick and easy to set-up and use , and quick to shutdown and pack up as well . I use the VGA input to connect my laptop to the projector , everything work fine and be quick and easy to setup . projector detect the video signal and the auto config work as expect . I project a 84 '' -lrb- diagonal -rrb- image use ECO mode -lrb- lower power\/brightness , less noise , longer lamp life -rrb- and leave the auto iris on -lrb- better black -rrb- . I do not need to make any adjustment to color , everything look good to I . the image quality be excellent for the price . for business purpose , it be very good . for home media , it be acceptable and , at this price , very decent . the black be not `` inky , '' but the image be bright and colorful . also a good choice for gaming via the VGA connection . there be no hdmus at this price , not a issue for business use , but it mean you 'll have to use component output to the VGA input connector via a special cable -lrb- not include -rrb- for best quality dvd\/movie video . no usb cable be include , either , which be a bit lame in my opinion , but , hey , look at the price ! verdict : the basic idea here be to deliver a good quality , budget projector that feature Epson 's key image and build quality , and basic feature , at the lowest cost possible , I believe Epson have hit the target and that these projector will be quite popular . I have raise my initial 4 star rating to 5 star base on my test and performance vs. cost -lrb- i.e. bang for the buck -rrb- . a excellent business projector and a handy all-around projector when use with a laptop or desktop pc via the VGA connector . --------------------- Update 2011-12-01 : photo and Art image look very good to excellent . there be plenty of detail , very bright , fairly sharp , wonderful color fidelity , and overall great image quality . I also do some limited testing to see how this unit would work with streaming video for casual movie watch -lrb- e.g. netflix , Amazon Instant video , etc. -rrb- . image quality be very acceptable . Blacks be decent , thing that be black , look black . this be no match for a good home theater unit , no inky black and `` pop '' here , but a very decent and eminently watchable image . would be great for sport , I be guess . I watch some Netflix film and they look very good , dvd quality plus\/minus depend on source . the Amazon video I watch -lrb- Firefly non-hd -rrb- be a bit lower in quality , but still acceptable . some native video -lrb- i.e. play from laptop hard drive -rrb- look great , near or better than dvd quality , YouTube video be pixellate due to they low resolution , but the higher rez look ok . -lrb- on a 84 '' image , you be go to notice block and pixellation w\/youtube and other lower quality source , so keep that in mind . -rrb- I use blutooth speaker or headphone for audio - do not bother with the projector audio . all in all , it be fun and I be very pleased with the result . I think many would be perfectly happy with this projector for casual movie\/video use -lrb- just do not compare it to a moderate to high-end HT unit -rrb- . the wonderful hbe -lrb- human brain effect -rrb- take over after awhile and you do not really notice any image quality issue . perfectly enjoyable and very inexpensive by comparison . also very easy to set-up and put-away . I project the image on my light beige wall and even that look pretty good . the auto iris do click a bit occasionally -lrb- as with most other unit -rrb- , but you can turn it off if this bother you . it improve the black a little bit , noticeable , but not a dramatic change . if you do not get too hang up on the lower resolution -lrb- vs. the newer 1080p unit -rrb- , moderate screen door effect -lrb- never bother I at all -rrb- , you 'll have a lot of fun . and , at current price , this be hard to beat in term of fun\/dollars spend .
Projector	POS	4	I get compliment on this screen every time I bring company home . my only complaint be it be slightly warped and a shadow show in bright movie frame , I do not know if it be always be there because it be so minor but it be annoy now that I see it . I have have it less then six month so it kind of piss I off for the price I pay . other than that , this screen be awsome !
Projector	NEG	1	I so want this to work . it would have be quite useful in we darkened basement for sleepover and such , not to mention take on vacation . the picture , though , be far too fuzzy to enjoy , and no amount of focus could bring it to clarity . maybe I have a dud -lrb- I do buy from the warehouse at a discount -rrb- , but I be just not impressed with clarity . that say , the ease of use be phenomenal . just turn on , plug in , and play . if you can deal with the fuzziness it might be ok for you . for a couple hundred more , I would prefer just to get a 42 '' plasma for my basement .
Projector	POS	4	use this projector for about a week now and so far so good . I do quite a bit of research on hd projector and find that this be the best one for the price . color be deep and good . image be good even in a reasonably light room . I will share more great purchase overall .
Projector	NEG	1	my pt-ax100u 's iris break after 10 month of use . 8 month after the iris be replace , the new iris break again . since so many people report this problem , Panasonic must recall this projector .
Projector	NEG	1	this quit work after just a few minute . we contact the company which manufacture it , and never get a answer . it go back the next day .
Projector	POS	5	when unpacked , the projector be good and play with a huge screen . downside to this projector be that there be no manual zoom meaning you have to move it closer or further from a wall to adjust screen size . this be a huge downside . I also hook up a PS3 that be work in 3d on a Samsung plasma 3d tv but it will not work on this projector . in fact no 3d source that have try will work on this projector . I have call Optoma and they need to call I back because they do not know what be wrong . I be use hdmus 1.4 and Optoma DLP link glass . all in all I would steer clear of this projector . I be go to revert back to my original year 2000 HP projector over this . first one be defective secondwork perfect and have be use 5 ft from wall at 100 inch and its perfectionist
Projector	POS	5	I have be use this projector for about a month . so far , no problem . Picture quality be very good for a projector price under $ 200 . I order on a Thursday and receive it on Monday . definitely recommend .
Projector	POS	5	I be very impress by this little projector . it will not take the place of the multi-thousand-dollar home theater projector , but if you be plan on use this around the house , you 'll be please . the first thing I notice be that it feel fairly lightweight , but the build quality be still good pretty good . it be not swim with input port , but it have one of all the basics , so it be nothing a adapter or splitter\/switcher can not fix . I run the hdmus to a receiver that provide the extra port I need for my Google TV\/XBox\/etc . , so the lack of extra hdmus port be not a issue for I , but it be something you 'll need to be aware of . I do not have a screen yet , but have be project against a fairly flat\/smooth offwhite wall . with the light off and the shades draw , the output be pretty impressive . the bright color be vibrant and sharp and the dark area be nearly as dark as they can be while be project against a wall in a room with some light bleed from outside . Air quality seem to be important too , we living room be near we kitchen and when we be cooking and there be smoke or steam in the air , even a bit , the light get a little more scatter . it be not a huge deal and you 'll probably only notice if you be look for it , and it be not unique to this projector , though a projector with better black will reduce this a bit . when I get a actual screen and seal up the blind a little better to reduce light come in from outside , I 'll update this review with my thought . I be a little disappointed that it be 720p , but at the distance you 'll use and watch it , 720p be adequate , especially for what this item cost . I do not know if upgrade to another projector at 1080p for $ 300-400 more be actually worth it . this thing also run very quiet so far , I have have experience in the past with projector that sound like they be cool with leafblower , so this little guy have be pleasant . all-in-all I be impressed with the power of this projector , especially for the price range .
Projector	NEG	1	the bulb be for my secondary tv . it be only use during the weekend when the kid be not in school . the bulb be replace a couple week ago and it burn out . the vendor be excellent . I be show what to do to get a replacement . yet the quality of the bulb be definitely not worth to explore
Projector	POS	4	when I plug it into the wall and into my computer -lrb- a ibook -rrb- , it work instantly . genuine plug and play . the menu control , while intuitive , be a little difficult to navigate . I may have to look at the manual . the focus be sharp ; the zoom , while a little limited to suit I , work easily . I plan to love use it . the first time be wonderful . I really recommend it !
Projector	NEG	2	product work great , look great , very quiet motor quite pleased - just complete 6 business session use it . several positive comment
Projector	NEU	3	the video signal be very good , the audio cable do make noise when no audio be play , but it be not notice when audio be be pay . overall , it be good enough for I .
Projector	POS	4	my old home theater room have my Projector on the table , very low class , now I this mount and my home theater be SWEET ! very professional look . my wife really like it .
Projector	POS	4	I receive my Qumi on Saturday from a order place on Cyber Monday -lrb- can not beat $ 100 off -rrb- . I choose the free shipping option and it only take 6 day . I also purchase a $ 7 cctv mount and love that Amazon package multiple purchase into one box . I read multiple review and watch countless comparison video on youtube . I have recently build a 103 '' screen in my basement and have test it use a borrow Viewsonic projector . I love the output but the idea of buy lamp in a few year be not appealing . I decide to try the Qumi because at 30000Hrs i can dedicate a projector for both movie and cable tv without worry about lamp life . I plug the Qumi into my Vizio blu-ray player and load `` Gladiator '' as my test movie . I mount the Qumi at a distance where the picture fill the 103 '' screen . I hit the light and sit down to enjoy . I be honestly surprise . the Qumi do not brighten the room as much as the viewsonic , but that be because the output be focus onto the screen . the image be crisp and focus from the get go and I do not have to tinker much with the focus wheel . I then change over to `` a bug Life '' and this be where it truly shine . the color from the animated movie be astounding . truth be , you can not just judge the output base on one movie , show etc. . try different media . if you plan on purchase this projector for home theater purpose , make sure that you have a relatively dim room . the projector will do well in a light room if you video or image be not dark . I be able to watch '' a bug life '' with full light on in my basement . not so with `` Gladiator '' . plan on use a home theater system for audio unless you plan to use headphone . for its size , i be surprised Vivitek have room for speaker . pro : can not beat 30000 hr . E.g. . if you leave it on for 24 hr , it will last for 1250 day -lrb- 3.5 year -rrb- Easy to mount . I use a ceiling mount for CCTV camera that i purchase together in build media player allow for multiple media option . watch movie download to my harddrive con : be prepared to buy adapter especially if you plan on mount it a good distance from you dvd player .
Projector	POS	5	this be we second MovieMate projector -lrb- we MovieMate 30 still be go strong -rrb- . we love the concept of have a build in dvd player and speaker . you do not need anthing else . the major improvement for the 30 to the 60 be the additional input -lrb- hdmus and VGA -rrb- . the microphone input be also unique add feature that I have not see anywhere else . I love everything about this product .
Projector	POS	4	the screen arrive well package and protect . it be easy to extract from the wrapping with a box cutter . it be also easy to hang . the first thing I do be throw a Blu-Ray movie onto the screen , and it look fantastic -lrb- paired with a 1080p Epson projector -rrb- . con : none -lrb- 1 week of use , so far -rrb- .
Projector	POS	5	love the alarm clock , it have 2 alarm that can be set for weekday , weekend , or both : easy to set and alarm signal blink when you use snooze function .
Projector	POS	5	this be a fantastic little projector it do just what it be mean for , on the spot presentation when you do not have access to a full size projector and you need to get you point across , this be the thing . people be surprise by what it could do I certainly be , I have my power point on a flash drive , prop this little baby up on a couple book have eight client in a little office and they be impressed . I just do not leave home without it .
Projector	POS	5	I find it very easy to setup on both pc and Macintosh computer . oddly , I have a small issue install the usb driver on my Mac laptop . when I connect the usb cable to my Mac , the mac pop up a alert that it could not identify the keyboard . I dismiss that dialog box and proceed with the usb video driver installation and once that be do , the projector pair up with the computer easily . no issue whatsoever connect the VGA cable to the pc with Windows 7 . the projector be immediately recognize by the laptop and the computer automatically start send the video signal to the lcd projector . brightness be in my opinion outstanding , even in a bright room with a lot of fluorescent lighting . I have my projector 8 foot from a wall and the image on the wall be roughly 6 foot wide and about 44 inch tall . I be impress with the amount of feature in this very reasonably price projector . the image be relatively sharp at 800x600 resolution and a zoom control on the projector be a unexpected feature that allow you to zoom in on photo or whatever be be project . the keystone adjustment let you correct for off axis projection angle within reason . just about everything can be control with the provide remote control . the remote even include a electronic pointer function that you can move on the screen via the arrow control . a good variety of port be available include RCA Audio port , S-Video , VGA cable and there be also a usb typea document camera port . a Kensington security lock slot be also available . there be no hdmus connection on this model . the projector let you upload a company logo or image of some sort that can be permanently use as the `` startup screen '' when you first turn the projector on . this can also be password protect thus give some amount of protection if the projector be steal . the operation of the projector can also be protect by a password if you wish . lamp life be project to be up to 4000 hour or up to 5000 hour in ECO mode -lrb- which reduce lamp brightness and fan noise since the bulb run cooler -rrb- . there be several color mode to choose from if you wish to tweak the balance depend on what you be project . overall I be very pleased with the ease of operation and quality of output provide by the Epson ex3210 multimedia projector .
Projector	POS	5	pro : use mostly for presentation and occasionally to display video , amazingly visible in a well illuminated room , minimal difference between ECO and normal mode so you can go ECO mode in any condition , cool feature to adjust light output to compensate wall paint color -lrb- so you can convert any wall into a real screen -rrb- , 6000 hour lamp in ECO , low noise , very good scaling of non native resolution try 1280 x 800 , 1366 x 768 and 1650 x 1080 , I feed a 720p hd OTA TV signal of a soccer game and the picture be excellent , actually amazing for a projector in this price range , brilliant color , lamp replacement around 120 usd , small footprint for a 2700 luman device , very good option for a datum projector at this price . actually this be the second Acer projector I buy for my group , very satisfied with the performance . con : \* no audio . \* no button , the remote control slide in the projector housing to be use as the button station , so if you lose the remote you will suffer , so better keep the remote attach to the projector . \* only 1 year of warranty , all other Acer projector have 2 , not sure why , however for less than 40 you can add 1 year of warranty . \* -lrb- not a con , more like a suggestion -rrb- seem like the auto keystone correction be too sensitive and may try to readjust the image every 5 minute or so , that cause image flickering , so manual keystone adjustment be the way to go . other thought : Acer be do very good electronics at affordable price , I have a Acer AMD laptop -lrb- 4 year old now -rrb- almost indestructible and very reliable , 2 23 '' lcd monitor buy for less than 139 each , very satisfied with Acer , keep the good work .
Projector	POS	5	install be a snap ! we have a previous projector mount that be not universal , and need to replace it due to the projector die . stick this universal one in its place , and it work . come with many part for 4 different type of protector fitting either 3 or 4 screw . the color match we ceiling , so it just blend seamlessly .
Projector	POS	5	I be use this for work presentation . great image at 10 foot ! fit in the palm of my hand . this pack away nicely in a carryon .
Projector	NEG	1	I buy this for new comer briefing for my business . it look good but that be about it . none of the input work . after follow the instruction and plug in a VGA cable to start with , there be a `` no sync '' screen showing . then I try different input include hdmus and s-video to no avail . I have own a few projector and this be product be just a waste of money . I end up purchase a pocket projector with the build in hard drive and good battery life -lrb- mpro150 -rrb- .
Projector	POS	5	the Yamaha ysp-4100bl be everything that it be review claim it be . far superior to the other less expensive competitive sound bar model in construction and performance . in this case , `` you get what you pay for ! '' .
Projector	POS	5	this mount appear to be very well make , but it would not fit the projector that I have purchase . it look like it only work for the smaller size projector . I have to return for a refund and order a new mount from another site .
Projector	POS	5	it work ok , but for the price I would go buy the one from apple . at time the connection be lose . it be a little sensative .
Projector	POS	5	while not as impressive as the surround sound room upstairs , it make a excellent compliment to any tv -lrb- 46 '' Sony XBR Bravia in this case -rrb- in a room that you do not wish to fill with speaker . add a sub-woofer , and the sound be excellent ! I would also suggest wiring the sound from you satellite , dvd\/blu-ray directly to the sound bar as I notice the sound slightly out of sync with the tv if you run it from the satellite and\/or blu-ray\/dvd through the tv and then to the soundbar . I could not justify pay retail price for this soundbar , but at $ 430 I feel it be a bargain and well worth the money .
Projector	NEU	3	Disclaimer : this be the only ceiling mount I have ever buy or use . I have install a lot of thing in my life and in my house , but this be the only projector mount . my impression be that it be as easy or slightly easier than average . you ideally want two people , because it help with : 1 . make sure the pilot hole you be drill into the ceiling joist be all around straight from all view angle 2 . stand beneath the one on the ladder , support the projector from below when it be finally be attach , because it very likely will slip and fall a little at some point , and it be amazing how useless this mount be with a smash projector 3 . understand the slightly too cryptic instruction other random advice : boy oh boy be joist skinnier than wall stud . and you do not want to screw into the edge of one and only discover this when the mount take the weight . we be lucky - we have two test hole which miss the joist , but by insert a large paperclip bent in a c-shape into each and spin they , we be able to tell right away that it be exactly in between the two . I have three problem with this guy . 1 . I install it on a 19 pound Panasonic PTAR100U , a projector I mostly love , especially for its excellent brightness . I try use the extend leg to mount it off-center from the joist . even with the 40 pound limit and the `` no-slip '' lock ring lock , the unit tilted toward the heavy side and there be no way around it . have to set up the leg so the joist and mount be directly above the center of the unit . the instruction do not talk about this . 2 . relatedly : even when balance , even with the `` no-slip '' ring lock , more than the tiniest nudge will tilt the projector in any direction . I call v7 and this be apparently just how the mount work . I be go to have to install some kind of additional stabilizer , like glue , or velcro , or a level that I can use to make sure I be fix it right when it tip again . every time I focus my projector or change the zoom , the image end up shift off the screen somewhere . I zoom out for 1:2.35 widescreen - totally fun with a 2.35 screen and a projector this bright ! but use the joystick to center the image , the resistance in the projector be like sixty time greater than the `` no-slip '' ring , so it be quite harrowing . 3 . it be only available in black , and the projector and ceiling be white . maybe I be crazy , but I think most projector be not black anymore , and most ceiling be some kind of white , so ... maybe that be part of why it be so affordable . all in all , it keep my projector close to the ceiling and it be reasonably easy to install , and it definitely allow for tilt correction more than some mount might -lrb- too much for I ! -rrb- , so it may be ok for you .
Projector	NEG	1	I buy this unit because the specification say he have a powerful and it be perfect for teacher but the device be not even recognize by the laptop , the backlight be terrible in the light of day . the screen size be extremely small and do not match the description give by the seller . definitely do not recommend this product to anyone . the quality be terrible . in addition , I purchase this product from Costa Rica , and now I regret the money spend on this device to bring up my country . this be my first purchase from Amazon disappoint I . people please ... do not buy this unit because they will throw away they money .
Projector	POS	5	I have have the pt-ax 100u for about 3 year now , and I have have the same problem with the iris that several other have comment on . Panasonic be no help and want load of money to repair the unit . of course , it be out of warranty as well ! so instead , I do a google search and find several home `` fix-it '' solution . basically , the iris mechanism have to be re-lubed with some oil after about 2 year of use . I fix my projector in about 20 minute -- and im not technically savvy either . if I can do it , I guarantee anyone can ! as far as the the bulb , I have easily make it to the 2000 hour mark with excellent video quality . I still think this projector be a fantastic bargain !
Projector	POS	5	with purchase be very good . arrange all . color sate . it be focus well . the small . the convenient . as the screen I use a white wall , the picture do not spoil . about what still to write I do not know , but it be require twenty word .
Projector	POS	5	nice usb to pc connection it be truly a plug n ' Play ! I just scan through the Quick Guide and I be able to operate the projector easily . my only concern be whether the 2600 lumen would be enough light intensity consider the natural light present , not to mention the church 's plain white wall be use to project image . however , it be plenty enough the project image off of Power Point presentation be quite legible and colorful from over 300 ft. . needless to say , I highly recommend this product !!!
Projector	POS	4	I buy this as a entry-level projector for my home office , for kind of as a toy\/experiment , and have be please with the result . the picture quality -lrb- 640x480 -rrb- be obviously low-end by today 's hi-def tv standard , but if you goal be to have a big screen at a low price , preferably as you `` secondary '' -lrb- i.e. not as you living room centerpiece -rrb- tv , then this be a good buy . I be use it for dvd , Roku , and computer , project on a $ 50 pull-down screen , and it project a 80 '' image from about 12 foot away . the picture be not too bright , so the room have to be totally dark for best result . the kid love it for the `` movie theater big-screen '' experience , and they do not complain about the video quality . I have use it to watch MLB tv and tv show via Roku , and that be pretty cool - again , we be not talk razor-sharp picture , but definitely good enough for I . I recommend it to any buyer who be ok with adjust his\/her expectation in order to get a inexpensive big-screen `` for fun '' . if you be a buyer who want a top-of-the line high-def video experience , I recommend get a higher resolution tv or projector .
Projector	POS	4	the installation be pretty straight forward . however , adjust it , as one reviewer have mention , can be tricky . when you begin to tighten the allen screw , the arm tend to move in the direction of the turn . also , tighten one axis sometimes jolt the other axis as well . as a result , I have have to just nudge the arm a little even after they be tighten to get they to position correctly . however , when all say and do , this be a extremely good mount . in fact , be be the only one I have find that be able to move my projector forward in the direction of projection .
Projector	NEU	3	this projector ceiling mount be economical and do the job of hold my Optoma projector up in the ceiling . Amazon have help I set up my family movie room by have all the a\/v product available .
Projector	NEG	2	I have own this projector for approximately 1.5 year now . the image the projector put out be great , but there be some obvious design flaw with the lamp cooling system . while the company have replace numerous component at no cost to I as I be still inside the 2 year warranty period -lrb- 2 lamp , the air filter , and now the entire projector -rrb- , at the current rate I expect to purchase a entire new projector within a year of the warranty run out . I have get 9 month out of each lamp so far , and once its out of warranty I will be able to replace the entire unit for the cost of the next two new lamp . I have also be disappoint with how loud it turn out to be , which be in contrast to a number of review I read when decide which projector to purchase . my unit be ceiling mount immediately above the couch , and the fact that the cooling fan be always on be noticible . lastly , my projector be mount near a air conditioning vent and get plenty of cold air , but still can not seem to last more then 2-3 hour without overheate .
Projector	NEG	2	the size and wieght of the unit be excellent . it have all the standard hook-up . the real weakness be the power of the lamp . the image from the projector can not be see in a light room . I think that I could use this for school ; however , the need for dark in order to see the image mean that my student can not see to write note . if you plan to use this product in a semi-lit room I do not think you will be able to clearly see the image project . if you plan to use this projector in a dimly light room , it may work for you .
Projector	POS	4	Pretty happy with this upgrade version . use this toy mainly for watch streaming video movie from Netflix . good for up to 40 in . on the wall in semi-dark env . link via s-video from laptop to composite video on the projector . buy a s-video to rca convertor . pro : - ultra compact - adjustable image size and color - always in focus - no noise con : - poor for view text -lrb- almost can not view any word in m word doc from VGA docking to laptop -rrb- look forward for hd and brighter laser pico projector in the future .
Projector	POS	5	this unit be just amazing .  although the rating be 800x600 , you can display 1024x768 with excellent result . if no one tell you , you would not know that 1024x768 be not the native resolution .  it be very light , and come with a remote that double as a mouse for you computer , which enable you to deliver presentation in a very professional manner .  although the rainbow effect that plague early generation dlp projector be present at time with this unit , I be not bother by it . you can only see it if you look for it , but be non-existant if you be captivate by the movie or show you be watch .  other point : - 1 composite video in - 1 s-video in - 1 vga in - 1 audio in - manual focus -lrb- that be a minus -rrb- - electronic lamp hour usage tracking - 4:3 , native , or widescreen -lrb- 16:9 -rrb- display mode - digital keystoning - it be as loud as a standard computer . so , at night you will notice it when all other sound be mute . that noise be usually cover up by the movie or tv sound or during the day by daily noise .  finally , there be two extra bonus when you get the unit . - the bulb now last 4000hr instead of 3000hr as advertised - it be 1100 luminen instead of 1000 as advertised - the bulb price be down to 299 buck , which make it very economical
Projector	NEG	1	could not read basic type from a computer monitor . totally illegible and pointless . i be expect a cute little energy efficient projector that at minimum could show email and such in meeting but this thing be useless .
Projector	POS	5	we need a extremely bright projector at we church since we have a huge amount of ambient light and other bright stage light in we sanctuary . this one do the trick ! it be like look at a tv screen even with all the other light on when it shine on we projector screen !!!!!
Projector	POS	5	I have have my Powerlite s1 + for a little over a year now , and I have virtually no complaint . through some creative shopping , -lrb- ie . pricematching and mail in rebate -rrb- I only pay about $ 350 for this projector . I have it permanently mount in the ceiling of my basement and have a screen that be about 113 '' diagonal . it have over 1000 hour of use now , and everybody that have be over to watch a movie on it have be totally blow away and they all want one . as far as the $ 100 component video cable from epson , I be worry about this too until I find a local company that make custom datum cable . I pay $ 13 for a 15 foot cable that work beautifully . initially I think maybe when my bulb wear out I would upgrade to a higher end projector , but now that I have have so much enjoyment out of this over the last year , I be plan on stick with it and just buy a new bulb or two .
Projector	NEG	2	I have purchase , this projector to replace my 6 year old NEC projector . I like that it have a hdmus input , 2500 luman , and think it would have a clean sharp picture . but I fail to notice that it be only 800 x 600 resolution . with my picture about 6 foot wide . the picture look blocky -lrb- if that be a word -rrb- . I could actually count the pixel on the screen . I have return this Vivitek projector and purchase another NEC NP216 projector with a 1024 x 768 resolution . the 1024 x 768 resolution make a huge difference in clarity . I will never purchase anything less than 1024 x 768 . I be sure a Vivatek projector with 1024 x 768 or higher would have a better picture .
Projector	POS	4	I actually pick this up refurb ` ed from woot.com , and I have to say I be very impressed with it so far . I buy it because I do not have a tv , and it have all the input a tv have and more : VGA through a include cable , hdmus through a hdmi-to-mini-hdmus cable -lrb- available on amazon for very cheap -rrb- , regular component cable -lrb- come in the package -rrb- , from a micro-sd card -lrb- sell separately -rrb- and also supposedly through usb . pro : - very small and light - come with a padded carry case - perfect for replace a tv -lrb- if you can make the room dark -rrb- - excellent resolution -lrb- 1200x800 max -rrb- - pixel be diamond-oriented -lrb- make movie clearer \/ less pixelated -rrb- - with the battery and micro-sd card , it do not actually need any cable at all - internal memory be big enough for a picture slideshow or a short home video - can flip the image -lrb- so you can run it upside down , or behind the screen , etc -rrb- con : - manual focus , and text will never ever be completely sharp no matter what - when the bottom be in focus , the top be slightly out of focus -lrb- not noticeable in video - only become a issue when read text -rrb- - hole for the tripod be right at the front . this mean that if you buy a small tripod -lrb- like the one recommend on this page -rrb- it will tip over backwards , no matter what you do - not sure how to get usb working . I buy a female-to-female adapter so that I could connect a flash drive to the usb cable they provide , but it do not detect it . I think perhaps you need to buy they proprietary cable -lrb- boo -rrb- overall , I love it . I do not think I would have pay $ 400 for it , but for $ 250 I could not be happier .
Projector	NEU	3	I try connect this projector to the appleTV gen 2 and for much of the content the appleTV refuse to render the image as the projector be not hdcp compliant . the best resolution render be 720p 60hz . the image be excellent but appleTV simply refuse to work with it . I be go to get another cable today before return it to amazon but the packaging say hdcp compliant . I be so glad I purchase this on Amazon to have a easy return . I would definitely get another Optoma though ...
Projector	NEG	2	buy this to mount my Epson 8350 projector ... I be die to get this thing mount and in my living room . however , it be not to be . it `` just miss '' the hole on the 8350 ... some people in the review have say it do fit the Epson 8350 and it have detail instruction . the product I receive do not fit it , and it be `` instruction '' be one sheet of paper let you know how many of each piece you should have , and a schematic . no step by step . regardless , call the return phone number on the packaging , and speak with a woman who say , in addition to the 1 '' and 3 '' extender that be include , they also have 5 '' extender , which would fit the Espon 8350 . they be ship `` for free '' -lrb- with a $ 3 shipping charge -rrb- . so , although it say UNIVERSAL , it be not quite . I 'll update my review when the piece come in ... but I now have to delay hang this a week . I would rather not ... sigh . = = = = = update = = = = = i receive the extender ... and it work fine . but it be false advertising to say this be `` Universal '' when it do not fit all projector . so ... buyer beware .
Projector	POS	5	this product do everything it be suppose to do very well , I would recommend it . the projector I be try to mount have its mount location in the strangest place and this mount be able to be adjust to where it need to be .
Keyboard	NEU	3	no problem pair with laptop run on Windows Vista . curved ergonomic keypad be really comfortable for long use , and the individual key layout be friendlier than full size wave keyboard . the battery life seem to be reasonable , no replacement so far after 1 month usage . take about 3-5 seconds to wake up from battery saving mode . ca not tell if Cap Lock or Num Lock be on or off ; a status indication led at the keyboard would be helpful . this can become irritating , especially typing a password text box . chassis for the keyboard could use stiffer plastic material , feel too fragile ; I doubt this keyboard can last long .
Keyboard	POS	4	only 4 start because it do not have a usb hub . that be absolutely the only down side . I love it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I love this keyboard ! this be , in fact , the second of this model of keyboard I have purchase -lrb- for different computer , the first keyboard be still in use -rrb- . I highly recommend to anyone to get one of these keyboard for themselves !! : -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	4	I really like my keyboard protector that I order . the color be amazing and it feel cool to type on . also , if you be prone to spilling crumb near you computer or anything that could be potentially harmful to you keyboard , I would highly recommend get a keyboard cover . it keep you keyboard protect and you keyboard do not get all dusty . it be very easy to put on and take off . the color of my keyboard protector match my case\/shell . love it !!
Keyboard	NEU	3	first I 'll admit I might be older than the usual person use to thumb typing everything ... I be not a huge texter , and when I email on my smart phone , I often make it short or use voice recognition ... so that be say , the keyboard be pretty good mechanically in that the button click nicely -lrb- so you know you have hit it a button -rrb- ... it be a qwerty layout , so good enough . . if you be use to thumbtype this be probably awesome ... there be a backlight which help see in the dark room ... there be a big mouse pad . . all good so far ... and it be small so it do not add significantly to the `` pile of remote '' . . however , my main issue be that I find the mouse pad not very responsive or sometimes to responsive . . its way too easy to ` double click '' and select a link as you try to slide over it . because it be a small area , you have no choice but to pick up you thumb and move it back onto the pad sometimes and this can be interpret as a `` click '' ... Everytime I find myself log in to a website , I find myself think `` gee , I should really just put a wireless keyboard and mouse here '' , and I may just do that ... but once all you site be log into , and you get the mouse speed across the screen good , this be probably a good thing . . and I mainly use the laser pointer to freak out the dog and the neighbor cat , but I could image it would be useful for presentation -lrb- again if you be good at thumb typing -rrb- . . but that be the design of this unit so I can not really make that a detraction . . if you want a full size keyboard , get a full size keyboard ...
Keyboard	POS	4	this be by far one of the coolest look keyboard around . it be incredibly thin , make of a sleek glossy black plastic and brush aluminum -lrb- which as someone else mention can get cold -rrb- . the keyboard have a solid , well construct feel and the keystroke be outstanding . I personally love my ThinkPad keyboard and this keyboard remind I of exactly that . the keystroke be precise but not as far -lrb- deep -rrb- as with a standard keyboard . the keyboard do have some drawback . first , I really wish there be a contextual menu key . that really bother I , because I constantly need to use the mouse instead . on the left side of the keyboard there be five button , `` sleep '' , `` zoom in '' , `` zoom out '' , `` default zoom -lrb- back to 100 % -rrb- '' , and a arrow button , which be strange as it be a left click arrow . I do not really use it and do not know why it be there . you can not change these key . the right side have a media key , which can be limitedly customize -lrb- i.e. only select media software -rrb- , a bar to adjust volume , a mute button , and a circular touch disk , and leave and right mouse button . the volume strip work fine , and I do wish that the touch disk be a bit bigger . I do like the fact that it be a disc , because you can scroll like a ipod by move you finger around the disc . it could be a bit better as far as sensitivity be concern . you can customize some of the f key , the other feature light up when you push the `` fn '' key which be located where you would expect a contextual menu key . I do not use these key all that much . cool that you can recharge it in the include stand . you do need a area of free desk space to `` show off '' you keyboard in the charger though . you can not have anything around it because the keyboard go all the way to the bottom of the charger when it be in its base -lrb- so that the keyboard be almost touch the desk -rrb- . battery life be really good . overall I would recommend this keyboard .
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy this baby after hear about the wonder of a mechanical keyboard , and there simply be no word that can explain how much better they feel than traditional one . the wonderful clicky sound you get when you press a key , the feeling of it on you finger . Use one for a day and then try to type on a regular keyboard , it will feel mushy and give you a stomach ache . this model be wonderful for anyone who do a lot of typing and gaming . they keyboard be heavy , so it do not slide around , and the easy to press clicky key will increase you wpm -lrb- or APM for you fellow Starcraft 2 nerd -rrb- . the lack of label force you to memorize the key , and as someone who use to look down every now and then for a symbol or two , I can honestly say this make you a much better typist . -lrb- plus it look cool as hell -rrb- . the only complaint I can possibly give this keyboard be its usb hub . the keyboard have 2 usb plug , one for the actual keyboard , and one that power 2 usb 2.0 slot on the right side of the keyboard . the problem be if you plug anything with a reasonably big usb plug into the slot , they get into you mouse area . other than that , I can not recommend this keyboard enough . if you be still typing on a regular keyboard , do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a mechanical , and you might as well fork over the money for the best .
Keyboard	POS	5	this be great ! Easy to setup\/connect , nice to look at . protective case . I test it out on a couple of email and note . still play with all the different function key . so far so good !
Keyboard	NEU	3	you get a excellent mouse with a decent keyboard . consider the price of the mouse itself , this be a great value . however , I be not impress with the quality of the keyboard . the key feel cheap , and the action be unimpressive . for my taste , the keyboard be much too `` soft '' and feel flimsy . the optical mouse , however , be a must-have item . the precision of a optical laser be fantastic , and microsoft really do make the best optical mouse out there -lrb- although other be cheaper -rrb- . the scroll wheel be extremeley useful , and the mouse feel great in you hand . if you need a keyboard and a mouse , this combo be a good value . but if you already have a acceptable keyboard , I would recommend buy the mouse alone .
Keyboard	NEG	1	these guy post a false picture of a illuminated black keyboard , that be very flexible and portable . what they send I be this crappy generic keyboard that have a very bad rubber material , that be not illuminate , and be a ugly gray color . the key dont even work correctly , you have to literally smash they to get they to enter . this be a waste of $ 20.00 . I even find the same generic keyboard on a website for only $ 5.00 . this be a rip off ! and yes , I be go to return it beware of this seller , and he cheap item .
Keyboard	NEU	3	good material but i be think the character it be come light like the key board but the color be black so there no light come up to you so you will do not benefit from the light !! so u can take the transparent one
Keyboard	POS	5	this keyboard work great right of the box , and most importantly , all the key be full size and in the right place . love that it have a off switch , since it be only use intermittently .
Keyboard	POS	5	I order this product since it be only about 3 dollar , and have free shipping . . much better than some other site that want 30 dollar for the same product . the color be a bit off from the picture , but I like it so much better !! it be a very pretty pink , and go well with the cover I have on my laptop . it fit great , but I have a 15 '' macbook pro , not a 13 '' . . so , maybe there be a bit more room for the product . I would definitely recommend get this product !! : d
Keyboard	NEG	1	I read the direction . it do not work . I love the cover though . the connect cord seem use and it look dirty .
Keyboard	POS	5	i have a 13inch macbook pro and i purchase this to protect the keyboard , i fear that it be go to be cheaply make but let I just say it be not ! its thin and fit perfectly over the key , it do not come up around the edge , and it feel more comfortable for my hand anyways since I be on the computer for extended period of time , definitely recommend , you can not go wrong for the price !!!
Keyboard	POS	5	this little unit be a cracker . I be use it in my media room for which be be perfect . the key be a bit small , but that be really the point , with the unit be similar or smaller in size than the other remote . the self light keyboard be excellent , allow for the key to be see in the darkened room . I can absolutely recommend this anyone with a media pc .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be very satisfied with this keyboard it be nice and it be get gentle key . this do not come with a manual so if you try to figure out how to change the backlight color , it right next to the dial knob . this keyboard also do not look tacky as I thougth it would be . it be just perfect and I think it be worth the price . you will not be disappoint with this one .
Keyboard	NEU	3	the cordless portion of this product set work fine most of the time although there have be a couple time I have to resynch it .  the keyboard be rather clicky and annoying if you have to listen to someone else typing on it . it feel okay if you be typing on it yourself .  I do not use the mouse anymore . I use a Logitech wireless trackball -lrb- which I love -rrb- . a nice thing be that I could the they trackball with the keyboard\/mouse receiver without add a second receiver .  the add control button be nice . I like the volume control wheel better than + \/ - button for volume .  I think I would like the left hand wheel but in reality , I almost never use it .  overall , its fine but I be not thrill with it . I probably would not buy it again but do not mind have it around .
Keyboard	POS	5	within a week of have this keyboard ive already spill water and meat on it and it get inside the key . you would never know . the key arent sticking and everything be work perfect . the keyboard be amazing , i have not learn how to use all the entensive feature but what i have so far be amazing . another mentionable thing be that most people complain of the palm wrest say it be useless , i find it very suitable personally . yes it be hard plastic but i dont put all my wait on it , i more use it as a elbow rest and i use it to lightly wrest my wrist on it to take some pressure off my finger while typing for extensive period of time . i think it be comfortable , you may believe different though .
Keyboard	NEG	2	this thing be a nightmare . it choose when it want to work . it be fantastic when it do work , I love the key and the shape of the mouse , but it only decide to work when it want to . there have be so many time where I have almost replace it , and then it will work for a while , then make I want to break it in half again . Trust I just spend the extra 10-20 dollar for a more reliable brand .
Keyboard	POS	5	I enjoy this keyboard thoroughly ; the backlight be really fun in the dark and the color can even cycle through three preset color use m1 , m2 , and m3 . I would definitely recommend it . I look at the g19 as well and to I the full color lcd screen be not worth it , and so far I be not regret my decision at all by save a good bit of money and go with this g510 .
Keyboard	NEG	1	key start fail after about 2 month , and some of the key marking rub off too . not recommend .
Keyboard	POS	5	consider my wrist start hurt so bad that I could not move they that too at 26 year of age and 3 year of be a consultant I realize I need to take action and stop typing on the laptop keyboard and get a comfortable keyboard . the wrist pain have not yet all go away -lrb- the keyboard be not a healer -rrb- but my hand feel much more relax . good value for money
Keyboard	NEU	3	it seem to function find but if you pick it up by the wrist rest attachment it be likely to fall apart and possibly crash to the ground . this be particularly upset since it be wireless which enable you the option of move the keyboard out of the way .
Keyboard	NEG	1	it be a very nice keyboard but some of the key dont work right . the company be great as far as give I another one but this one have problem too . I do not want to be a bother so I have not say anything about the replacement be mess up too .
Keyboard	NEG	2	it take a lot of time get use to typing wit this cover , and be not very comfortable . I have hear that there be ventilation issue use this . if I be you , I would purchase a keyboard wipe -lrb- or chamoix -rrb- and avoid use this .
Keyboard	POS	5	this be a awesome deal at $ 99.00 . basically turn you tv into a internet surfing device . Google Chrome be on there and I use it more there than on any other computer at home . Netflix work great , Pandora and Internet video podcast queueing . I subscribe to a number of video podcast and it be great to watch they in hd right from the device . I hear lot of complaint about hook it up and get start , but it be easier than my last Bluray player .
Keyboard	POS	5	very please to the eye and very responsive . only negative thus far installaton cd be not include as state , not sure why . Got sofrware and latest driver off site and everything go well without a hitch . key be rather large and to my liking , the lead light have 2 brightness level and the choice for none which be nice . very pleased , would definitely recommend !
Keyboard	POS	5	Ok , at first I could not get this to work . when I copy the driver over to the phone and when I finally find a app call `` appinstaller '' I be able to install this app . well I get that far think this be not that bad . wrong . it will not activate ... then I read a review from someone here on amazon in this thread . anyway , this be what I do . I when to setting , wireless and network . turn on my bluetooth with a check . go into Bluetooth setting . scan for device and there it be . I tap the Micro Keyboard that be find and enter `` 0000 '' and tap ok . then I go to my keyboard and enter `` 0000 '' and enter . can you believe ? it work the device say connect to hide . think there may be more to what I do to get this to work because I do install another free app call `` BlueInput '' for hid that be still on my phone . if you have trouble play with this app then go back to what I say above . sorry for all these crazy instruction . Quickoffice work great and I love this keyboard . I read some of the other review on the f key and think that be good info . if you want contact I I be all ear . it work great on my Droid X. that be cool the touch pad work great as do the directional key in quick office . this be so cool . have a great day ...
Keyboard	POS	5	this work great with linux and 7 with no driver install . you can conserve battery life by turn off the remote portion when you do not need it . the usb transceiver be impressively small . you can turn the mousepad action sideways if you like . the keyboard will illuminate on demand . its the perfect solution for the home entertainment box run Netflix . could not ask for more .
Keyboard	POS	4	the key board cover be really nice and easy to use . you just place it over you key - it keep dust and dirty stuff from get all over you key . I bring this because I have really oily finger and I do not like the oil mark on that be leave by key on the screen . this key board cover for I reduce the oil mark on the screen . my friend be use my laptop and he be like do something weird happen to you key , they feel different ? he do not even know there be a cover ! Thats how nice the cover be . I recommend this type of cover not the color one because they be more professional and the light still glow nicely . on the f5 and f6 button there be just the f5 and f6 symbol not the symbol to make you key light up or down . all the other button be the same as you key board . now that I have the cover I barely use the key light except when im in the dark . the feel be really soft and a little higher than you might be use to but you will get use to it because its a small difference . oh and the key do not make that much noise with the cover when you typing very fast . this could be useful in a meeting or a class . I be really happy I buy it . it be not too much either
Keyboard	NEG	2	i now know why this be only $ 2.54 . the rubber use trap and catch dust very easily . i intend to use this for my new macbook air , but this be obviously make for the older generation pro because the keyboard backlight barely show through , the cap lock light do not show through at all , and the top right button have a eject button instead of a power button . it fit perfectly fine , but make typing less enjoyable - i do not like the feeling of the rubber and like i say before , it catch dust a lot . bottom line : if you be on a budget , this product will do the trick , but it be very much the `` bare-bones '' of keyboard cover . it be also probably better suit for macbook pro
Keyboard	POS	5	buy a new Macbook for my daughter go off to college . assume there be go to be a lot of wear and tear so wanted to protect it as much as possible . could not be happier . the installation be a breeze . about 8 seconds to figure out which way to align the bottom , then snap into place . the top be equally as easy . about 5 seconds to snap in place . receive it within 2 day . Amazon never fail to please I !
Keyboard	NEG	1	after have this keyboard include with my tablet pc , I start use it regularly in the office for the past couple of week -lrb- do not use keyboard much first couple week -rrb- but be have intermittent issue with the connectivity\/syncing , not to mention the lag mention in previous review when it do work -lrb- I could have live with that though -rrb- . I would get 1-3 day of functionality before it would just stop work ... I think it be a computer\/software\/windows 7 issue so i would uninstall and re-install and it would work again for 1-3 day -lrb- 1.5 day be the average and yes i change the battery too -rrb- and after a excruciatingly long wait time with asus to get resolution -lrb- that be another review ... -rrb- they say `` we 'll send a email with return instruction '' ... the email never come ... and the keyboard finally stop work altogether -lrb- computer could no longer discover -rrb- when I call back they say the Microsoft 6000 keyboard be not cover in the warranty - it be one week past 30 day coverage ... never again for the MSFT keyboard or ASUS for that matter ... poor product poor customer service .
Keyboard	POS	4	I use this with a pc plug into the tv . sit on the couch from across the room , the wireless aspect work great . here be a few thing I really like about the keyboard : the trackball be easy to use the `` mouse '' button for the trackball be well positioned and have several option . there be a handy left-click button on the edge of the keyboard just under the trackball . it be very well position for how I hold the keyboard . likewise the scroll wheel on the left edge of the keyboard be in the perfect place to use it . and there be two other left\/right mouse button on the main keyboard surface . the keyboard be a nice small size but will full size key . more equivalent to a large laptop keyboard than a desktop keyboard . I do not want a big keyboard sit by my tv and this fit just right . the only downside I have see be : there be no indicator light -lrb- numlock \/ cap lock -rrb- on the keyboard . that be a real problem when log in . I understand they probably omit the light as a battery power save feature but I really think they be necessary . really minor here : the wireless receiver dongle be larger than I would like . it be stick out of a front usb port on my pc and I would really appreciate a smaller receiver so there be less chance it could get bump and break .
Keyboard	POS	5	I think those ergonomic keyboard be just gimmick by the manufacturer , but when I need a external keyboard for my laptop , I decide to try one of those . at $ 15 , this keyboard do not cost too much above the regular cheap one , so I guess why not try this comfort keyboard . turn out this keyboard be really comfortable ! I do not realize it until I use this keyboard , but on normal straight keyboard , we wrist be actually force to bend a little bit , and this keyboard eliminate that problem . no more strain after hour of write term papers . there be a short learning curve , perhaps 2-3 day , to get use to the different feel of the key ' layout . this keyboard also increase typing speed , especially if you be a touch typist . the increase be pretty significant , sometimes I have press the next button before I lift my finger off the shift key , so my capitalize word look like this . I be use to the amount of time require to press shift button in normal keyboard , so that take I a while to get use to . some shortcut button on top of the keyboard be pretty useful , and no installation whatsoever be require to enjoy those button . the one that I use the most be back\/forward for browse , and volume up\/down\/mute . there be also a handy calculator button above the number pad on the right , which be also very helpful . overall , for $ 15 , this be a excellent purchase . highly recommend for people who earn they living by typing for hour at a time .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have try dozen of mouse and keyboard and this be the best in every category . the feel of the keyboard be good and it be clearly readable even in low light . the mouse be comfortable and quiet and work smoothly with no jump around . the keyboard and mouse both work for a very long time on very few battery -lrb- just one for the mouse -rrb- . there be a low battery indicator on the mouse . the keyboard and mouse both wake up from sleep seamlessly - no accidental button press as with other wireless device . the range be superb - I have no issue use the mouse or keyboard from the other side of a large room . I use these for both Windows and Ubuntu with no configuration require . Perfect .
Keyboard	POS	4	since it be a droid we know Google will be upgrade and upgrade and upgrade - so maybe in a year it will be worth the full $ 300 . 1 . can not believe how easily it combine verizon , youtube , internet , netflick , pandora , hbo et al into search and give we quality feedback 2 . the keyboard be real quality and have many touch which make surf easier e.g. a key in the upper left corner for mouse click and the mouse pad on the upper right for page transportation - I be not sure lefty 's will be as happy but I will have my son check that out and let you know . 3 . can lay flat on the couch and easily surf the web on my 42 '' plasma tv . and it take up all 42 inch e.g. I like Annenbergs French in Action and I can click on any of the 52 lesson and it be just like be there . 4 . family picture on picasa\/google be full screen and look very good - not as smooth as my 18 '' laptop but great for the whole family to sit around the living room and laugh at how we look year ago . have some trouble boot googletv but a quick call to logiteck solve all my problem politely and professionally . except for the price I be very pleased - but I know that before I spend the $ 300 - and now that I have googletv run it would be much easier for I to make the same purchase again . you have extremely high expectation if you be disappoint with the logiteck\/googletv product . UPDATE : leave hand son be very comfortable with the keyboard . a week after my initial review I still believe this product be quality and I be use it more than my 18.5 '' laptop .
Keyboard	POS	4	pro  adjustable  Rubber matte finish be great  good concept  Easy to establish Bluetooth connection with ipad  like the hotkey , especially the home and lock button con - hard to open and adjust without get fingerprint on ipad . - screen be top-heavy ... and fall backwards if not adjust correctly . - lock placement above backspace -lrb- delete -rrb- key be bad . - keyboard be too compact . - bottom left of the keyboard be lower than the rest of the keyboard . - keyboard be warped
Keyboard	POS	4	there be nothing wrong with this keyboard . the key have what I would call , a geographic , tactile shape , so it give the user more clue as to what key they be on . since I cheat in my high school typing class , it do not help I so much . it be a nice keyboard if price be you 1st priority .
Keyboard	POS	5	I want a keyboard with key that light up , and I want something good for gaming . this keyboard satisfy both . there be a hardware switch on the keyboard to disable the Windows key . that be very handy . the 12 programmable g-key be nice , and the keyboard be very quiet when typing . even if I do not play pc game , this would be a perfect keyboard for everyday use . with my old Logitech keyboard -lrb- just a plain cheap usb keyboard -rrb- , I have problem with try to play my game , for example , the `` v '' key would not register if I be press w and E. this keyboard greatly reduce problem like that , although the feature be undocumented . if you need a keyboard that can do more than a normal keyboard and you want to get something nice without spend too much , this be the keyboard for you . I pay $ 60 and it be worth it . the built-in port for a headset be awesome , and the fact that the keyboard have a usb port built-in means that you can plug in you gaming mouse or a flash drive right into the keyboard . I like this keyboard a lot , and I recommend it highly .
Keyboard	POS	5	I just want to say that I pick the keyboard up the other day , and I like it a lot . the space bar issue seem to be fix because it be very easy to press for I . so if that be what hold you back , I would say try it out for yourself at a local store . the overall build quality be excellent , and it work fine with Vista .
Keyboard	POS	5	it be easy to install and a pleasure to use . it have make work from home tremendously easy . sit in a chair try to type into the big screen tv that we also use as a computer be so hard unless I light up the room . now I can work in the dark or with the tv on . I be not sure why else one would need it but it I be 100 % satisfied and it be exactly what we set up call for .
Keyboard	NEG	2	since purchase the Logitech revue , i go through three unit . each one have totally different , yet major flaw . finally return the device for good for a full refund . First defective unit : have a non-responsive left arrow key on the keyboard . could not go through the setup process without the use of it . exchange unit for another one . second defective unit : after a day , start reboot uncontrollably . exchange it for another one . third defective unit : after a day of use , there be a mysterious pixelated gray distortion right in the middle of the screen when watch video . Power cycle resolve it for about 5 minute or so . return it for good ! I would also like to mention that all three of these unit be unable to see my 802.11 n network , or even my neighbor 's . it only would see my 802.11 g band . browse logitech 's forum show this seem to be the case . the logitech revue may possibly be 802.11 g only ! if this be the case , that will be false advertising . I would also like to mention that 99 % of the major network provider have block all video content from be view on any google tv device . I find the logitech revue to be only a netflix player when i be use it . I recommend wait a year before try google tv . I also recommend never purchase this logitech revue . 1 star , and 1 extra star for the effort .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be look for a rf mouse\/keyboard that will go beyond the logitech 's 6 foot range and also a keyboard small enough to place on my lap . I be have a lot of trouble with my logitech 's keyboard reception , I use my BigScreen tv as a monitor and work away from my desk -lrb- sometimes I work in bed ! -rrb- .  the installation be straight foward since they be use the Windows usb human Interface Drivers . if you have Windows 98se or greater you 'll be ok .  keyboard : the keyboard be good , rf work better than logitech , it be small enough to place on you lap -lrb- if you do not like laptop keyboard this be not the right keyboard for you -rrb- . it have 15 shortcut button , but since there be no software you can not change they functionality . the button work as follow : \* next Track , Prev Track , Play\/Pause , Stop , volume + , volume - , mute -lrb- work with Windows CD Player or the default media player -rrb- \* back , foward , stop , refresh , home , search , favorite -lrb- work with ie -rrb- \* Mail -lrb- workw with the default mail app -rrb- . note : you 'll need me or greater to take full advantage of the sortcut button .  mouse : the mouse be awesome ! , it work both as a optical or gyroscopic mouse . the gyroscopic functionality be the best , it take I about 5 minute to get use to it and the more I use it the better I get -lrb- it be the same learning process as use a mouse for the first time -rrb- .  -------------------------------------------------------- pro : Easy to install 25 Feet rf range Optical and Gyroscopic Mouse  Small Keyboard Good look  con : shortcut key can not be customize need win me or greater to take full advantage of the Keyboard Shorcuts .
Keyboard	NEG	2	during first-time setup the revue install the 3.1 Honeycomb update in around 20 minute . yes , the media player be seriously lack . I mean , it do not even support external subtitle . my 3.5 year old wdtv be infinitely better at play file from usb drive . for online video , I be almost happy with the revue , but then I try to play a full episode of Conan from teamcoco.com and the shockwave plug-in keep on crash . I try the same video on my laptop and they play flawlessly . the android market sound good , but so far all the app for the revue be really worthless . I return the revue since it can not replace my WDTV and it do not reliably play online video -lrb- other than YouTube -rrb- .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use a Microsoft Natural keyboard for many year , start with they very first model . a friend give I a first generation Mac Mini , complete with Mac keyboard , and while I love the Mini the keyboard drive I nut . I need to find a fairly compact ergonomic keyboard , due to desk space constraint , and this be what I find . I could type all day on it -lrb- at 110wpm -rrb- with no problem at all . it work perfectly with my Mac . I just wish it be a usb keyboard rather than my have to use a PS\/2 - -rrb- usb adapter , but that be a minor quibble . it be a great keyboard and definitely recommend for anyone who type fast and type a lot .
Keyboard	POS	5	I own five of these - do that say enough ? First of all I be go to come right out and say that I completely do not understand the number of 1 and 2 star review . I hate to refer to someone as a moron base on they review of a keyboard , but in this case , it be entirely difficult not to . I find myself ask `` what be wrong with these people ? '' a lot while read the negative review . that say , I notice that a lot of the negative review be write by programmer , and perhaps they need be different than mine . I have spend the better part of the last 15 year of my life in front of a computer . I find that entirely depress for the most part , but it be true . for many year I be a enthusiast , and then I spend 5 year as a computer repair guy in a local computer shop , after which I move onto a job in the web host industry and spend 5 year mixed between tech support and management . I start use this keyboard during the management phase of my time at the web host company , and ... wow . it really make a huge difference in my comfort level sit at the desk . I have begin to develop a bit of carpel tunnel , tingle in my wrist and finger , etc ; after buy this keyboard , it all go away . I be not suggest that will be everyone 's experience , just that it be my own . I have own a whole lot of keyboard , and this be easily the best that I have ever use . it be rock solid , have perfectly size key and a nice , soft wrist rest built-in . a lot of these programmer type in the negative review have complain about the space bar be hard to strike , but that be not my experience ; in my time with this keyboard , it be be a breeze . I almost never use the short-cut key at the top ; just never get in the habit . they work , though , for the record . at the beginning of this review I state that I own 5 of these keyboard . I should add that I have also buy these for many people that I know , and they have all adjust to it quite well and love it . no one I know first-hand have ever have any issue with it .
Keyboard	NEU	3	so i get the keyboard and be very excite since i have destroy my old keyboard with water lol . so anyways i get it all hook up and all but a few of the key work on it and unfortunatly the six key on both the keyboard and the number pad do not work but other than that its great , i think i can live with the few key not work but it would have be nice have all the key work
Keyboard	POS	5	I purchase the 1st trent case with wireless keyboard ; I like it but it be very fragile . after about 1 month of continual use , the latch break ; which render the case useless . the 1st generation version now sale for $ 44.00 -lrb- but I would advise against purchase it -rrb- . anyway here be what I like so far about the New Trent one : -lrb- 1 -rrb- sturdy construction -lrb- 2 -rrb- ipad fit nicely -lrb- 3 -rrb- look like it cost more than it actually do -lrb- 4 -rrb- 6 position for hold the ipad -lrb- 5 -rrb- turn the iPad off in closed position -lrb- 6 -rrb- keyboard very responsive with a sturdy feel to it similar to a small laptop -lrb- unlike the Trent 1 -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- not as heavy as I think that it be go to be -lrb- 8 -rrb- since ipad be not attach to the actual case , you can use the tablet freely without a heavy case hang onto it -lrb- 9 -rrb- can completely remove the keyboard from base to type , need I say more ? this be a great investment ! note : the iPad simply rest in the case , it do not lock in , so if you plan to use it while you be sit on you bed or couch , be careful . also I be a little worried that the case might scratch the face of my ipad . I 'll update if my fear come true . do not miss out on this one , it be the real deal ! I be so pleased . UPDATE : I still love my case ; wish I have the new Zagg , but it cost between 30-50 dollar more . no scratch , at least not yet . remember that you can always buy a screen protective sheet through Amazon -lrb- 3 for about $ 4.00 -rrb- ; or if you have a dollar tree in you city , they run a buck a piece -lrb- so why pay more -rrb- . be careful when open you case , I almost tear off a key . you may want to practice opening and close the case to avoid compication when you may need you tablet most . happy shopping !
Keyboard	POS	5	I purchase the Ultimate keyboard at my local Fry 's electronics store . unfourtunately it be a open box item and I despise that type of item but be the last one and I could not be bother to go to a different store . I open the item and check it closely for any scratch , ding , key broken\/mixed , etc. . it look as if it be not use . note the box look very use . prior history : I have look over many `` gaming keyboard '' produce by various company . the g11 by logitech look like it would suit my need and have alot of Macro key as well . when I use it , it feel a bit cheap and I could not stand how far to the leave it extend as I miss my esc key alot due to it . aside from that the vengence by Corsair be nice , I like the seperate color key , but it do not fit the aesthetics I want . I want a sleek keyboard , with loud click like 80 's style keyboard -lrb- as I really enjoy the sound -rrb- , backlit key , and macro key . there be a standard keyboard on sale that sound great , but no macro key : -lrb- Currently : I have be use this keyboard for a little over 2 week , I have customize the key to fit my need -lrb- cap lock disabled and set for a Ventrilo Push to talk button . -rrb- Macros to help my mmo need and repetitive datum entry need . as I normally work late at night the back light to the keyboard be very nice , and the clack of the key create a really nice audio sensation . the sound arent overpower but almost reassure you hit the right key with speed . I be able to double click the keye very quickly with little pressure which be perfect in the necessary game I play . the extra port on the side of the keyboard be perfect for quick access to my computer without go behind my machine . pro : audible clack upon press key backlit keyboard macro key reassignment\/disable\/program launch quick and interactive installation be quick and easy Easy access port on side con : key may be to loud for other -lrb- not I -rrb- can not change the light color for certain game mode -lrb- g11 do -rrb- note : I have not check my space bar or any overlap of key , but I have not have a problem so far . I would reccomend this keyboard , and purchase it again , despite its steep cost .
Keyboard	POS	5	it be also a lightweight and inexpensive alternative to the traditional keypad available . \* initial inspection \*\* test \*\*\* pro 's and con 's \*\*\*\* Conclusion \* the keyboard \/ mouse come as a 3-piece package . in addition to the keyboard and mouse , there be also a small receiver that plug into the usb port . the mouse run on two -lrb- 2 -rrb- aa battery -lrb- supply -rrb- and the keyboard run on two -lrb- 2 -rrb- AAA battery , also supply . \*\* installation take all of 30 seconds from the moment you plug in the receiver . this set be suppose to work exclusively with Windows xp through Windows 7 . as I have a copy of Windows xp nestle in VMWare fusion , this be where I be go to base my review upon , however this set be instantly recognize by the Mac 's OS . go figure . one of the thing you 'll immediately recognize be that the key have just enough resistance and spring to make typing easy and fast . the key be also amply spread apart for bigger finger . on the winxp side , the set work perfectly with Microsoft Office 2000 , Windows Media Player and Roxio Creator 2010 -lrb- at least , the work software in Roxio 's bundle . -rrb- on the Mac side , Microsoft Office 2008 , iTunes , Quicktime and Adobe CS3 be responsive to the keyboard and mouse . in fact , I be write this review from the Mac side . the only difference would be that the shortcut key on the Mac side : command + , be now Windows -lrb- icon -rrb- + , everything else include the volume , light , work the same . a dedicated media key on the header row have to be program before it 'll work for either pc or mac . compare the slimboard to Apple 's `` Wireless Keyboard , '' both key have a wonderful touch response . and , with the exception of Apple 's be make out of aluminum and verbatim 's of plastic , the only really difference be the additional 7 '' that accommodate the traditional pc numeric pad . the difference in height and width be negligible . all thing be equal , with a separate keypad on the Apple , it would be about the same length . \*\*\* pro 's and con 's pro 's + beautiful , glossy finish . + key response be very good . + function with both pc and Intel Mac ! + Lightweight . + Inexpensive . con 's - -lrb- not really a negative criticism , but the keyboard be very long .

Keyboard	NEG	1	top row of key do not work . supplier say the return have to go to the manufacturer but there be no manufacturer list on the packaging . keyboard be cheap but the shipping rate be inflate . they have a 30 % restock fee and I have to pay the return shipping . a return just be not worth it . beware purchase from Amazon where they be not the supplier . Amazon do a excellent job of service but only when they be the supplier .
Keyboard	POS	5	I wish I have think of this . the silicon protect from dust , cat hair , and liquid , and it even make the clicking of my key quieter . what more could I want ?
Keyboard	NEU	3	I need a small keyboard . this one be small and affordable . it be kind of annoy to use though . maybe it be not fair to complain about it - since it be serve a purpose -lrb- be small -rrb- - but my general impression of the keyboard be not favorable .
Keyboard	NEG	2	I do not know if the keyboard I buy have be use before -lrb- the packaging look a little suspect -rrb- but when I use this product , it be always a guess game as to which key would not be work - sometimes one or two sometimes 10 or 12 . I really , really like the concept ; I think that it increase the usability of the Palm 100 % since you can keep it open on you desk and enter stuff very quickly . I hesitate to talk badly about anything Palm since I have have one for 5 year and do not go anywhere without it . Suffice to say that I be very disapointed .
Keyboard	NEU	3	foreign buyer beware be for english layout keyboard . i fix mine with a black permanent marker and a silver marker but sill the enter key be different size so i have to use a scissor also .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be a writer and I be so glad I find this keyboard ! the keyboard have a slight ergonomic wave to it that I adjust to without even notice the difference . the hand rest be firm , yet comfortable and build into the keyboard . and can I just say that this keyboard be totally pimp out ! there be so many different programmable function key that I have not even use they all yet . a few of my favorite : I love that there be a button with a camera on it and I can program it to open up my picture with one click . there be also a button with music note . with a push of that button , my iTunes open up ready to go . use the Fn key plus any of the f key number from 1-12 will open up a different feature . for example , I program the `` w '' for the word program on the f1 key to open up my current work in progress . the f2 key have a x for Excel and it be program to open up my spreadsheet so that I can track my word count progress for my current WIP . I love typing on this keyboard . the button have just enough give , be not too `` clicky '' and I feel like I can type even faster than before . the mouse be great . it be the first time , I have have a mouse with the forward and back button for web-surfing on the side -- soooo handy ! if you have be wishy-washy in the past about update you keyboard and mouse , I would suggest take the plunge and get the Logitech Wireless Wave mk 550 keyboard and mouse combo . I think you 'll love it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use the Microsoft Natural keyboard for a number of year . I really think this be the best one yet . it be very comfortable and the key have a great feel to they .
Keyboard	POS	5	if you be like I and use you ThinkPad every day , you have get very use to the touch and speed of the keyboard and trackpoint -lrb- the red dot -rrb- . this keyboard have the same touch with a add numeric keyboard . the back edge of the keyboard also have 2 usb port -lrb- near the f4 & f5 key -rrb- . I never check to see if they support usb 2.0 though . one thing that be not include be a power button , but now I be get really picky . all in all , another excellent keyboard from IBM . -lrb- yes , it still have the IBM logo on it . -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	5	a excellent buy ! I have try these curvy keyboard before , but this be the first one I be able to start use right away without hit all the wrong key . it just fit so much better - and the raise front with the wrist rest be fantastic . I be skeptical about pay $ 50 for a keyboard , but it be worth it .
Keyboard	POS	5	i be so pleased with this keyboard . it be the best keyboard i have ever use . i be a bud writer and have write quite a bit . the lighting be so nice look . i can lie in bed and type easily see the key with no light on to bother my wife . it be also quiet , and have a nice feel to the key . they spring back just right for I . i have only have it a week . i just hope it last for a long time i love it so much .
Keyboard	POS	4	when I find out my friend spill a drink on she laptop and ruin it , I purchase one of these . very light and it fit the key so well I do not even notice it anymore . only problem be it do not cover the speaker portion on my Macbook on the right and leave side of the keyboard . other than that , it fit and cover the keyboard completely and the price be great !
Keyboard	POS	5	awesome deal ! I be a little leery about this , because of the price , -lrb- 1 cent -rrb- but I get it very promptly . and it look , feel great on my white Macbook . the font be the same , so its like it be a factory part . the only downfall , be the the black on the skin , be like a newspaper , and get on you finger , but its not that bad ... def not something to whine about ... great deal , awesome shipping and product , highly recommend !
Keyboard	POS	4	this be a absolutely excellent product , and you just can not beat the price . in we conference room , the computer be back in a corner near the lcd projector . unfortunately , that be nowhere near the conference table where people sit . previously , we have to jockey thing around and avoid trip over cable to make thing work .  now , you can sit anywhere in the room and control the pc . you can even pass the keyboard and mouse around . Goodbye cable ! and it be completely plug-and-play . pop the include battery into the keyboard and mouse , plug the rf receiver into the keyboard and mouse port on the pc , turn on the computer , and you be up and run ! the hardest part be open the seal plastic packaging .  one other reviewer mention a inability to use the keyboard and mouse simultaneously because of channel conflict . you can -- and should -- have the two run on different channel . it even say so in the documentation . unfortunately , the default setting put both on the same channel , so you might have a problem unless you read the documentation first .  my only complaint with the product -- the only thing that keep I from give it five star -- be the size of the mouse . it be a little wide and hard for people with small hand to use . but that be nitpicking .  I be order one for home tonight !
Keyboard	POS	5	simplicity . comfort . Value . very good keyboard . oh . . and most importantly - non alphabet key -lrb- arrow key , Insert\/Delete\/Home \/ end\/pageup\/pagedown -rrb- be in `` proper '' 1980 's era `` IBM '' position . less than $ 20 . no battery to run out . no bluetooth to pair . no Wireless dongle . excellent value .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be a bit leery buying this keyboard because I be not sure how often I would have to charge it . I figure if I be plug the thing in for a full day to charge every 5 day , it would defeat the purpose of have a wireless device . much to my delight , I have own the keyboard for three month , use it 5 day a week for work , and I have charge it only once -lrb- and even then I suspect it be because the device do not have a full charge out of the box -rrb- . grant I usually turn the illumination off because I simply do not need it , but there have be several occasion where I have forget to switch the keyboard off at night and the battery meter remain full . I would strongly recommend this product to anyone look for a wireless keyboard . the illumination be a bonus for I , but if you need that it too work great . I be a huge fan of Logitech and they unifying platform . I use this keyboard in conjunction with a m510 mouse on the same receiver dongle and have have no problem .
Keyboard	POS	5	I do not think I be go to like it , and the way the company ship it , I be disappoint . but , when I take it out of the envelope and put it on my MacBook pro , I fall in love with it ! it fit perfectly , protect my key from dirt & dust , and I can still see the light keyboard through it ! the minor flaw it have be that the letters\/numbers\/symbols be not perfectly align . - just a minor insignificance !
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be look at IR keyboard for quite some time , I have a PALM Centro , Treo 700 , and a ancient pocket pc run PALM OS . although the PALM software be not compatible with my Windows 7 computer , it work fine with Vista and xp , and it be a very quick and easy setup , and work like a charm . and it be a awesome alternative to those tiny button and handwriting stylus .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I buy two of these on sale from a local retailer . while they be good as a quick replacement keyboard that be also wireless , serious typist or anyone picky may want to look elsewhere . -- pro : the wireless component work pretty well . it can also work with a Panasonic plasma tv , and some of the function key can access important part of the menu . I like the nano-receiver . I can leave it in a laptop , and wrap a sleeve around it . at the very least , the regular function key be the default , instead of force user to press a `` fn '' key just to access `` f2 '' and the like . of course , the blue-labeled function key like volume up or change track do come in handy . -- con : Logitech remove a lot of important modifier key on the right side , notably the Windows key and the context menu key , the latter of which be replace with a blue `` fn '' key . this be a disadvantage for both Windows and Mac user who frequently use keyboard shortcut . -- MISCELLANEOUS : I do not mind the `` dark fleur '' design . the feel of the keyboard , for I at least , do not quite feel substantial . I can get use to it if I be force to use it daily , but without the miss modifier key on the right side , I probably will not use it in the end . it be also kind of big to use for a home theater setup , unless you be do spreadsheet on a big screen tv . it be still fairly lightweight .
Keyboard	POS	5	excellent buy !!! the software install flawlessly , very easy to remap macro button , very very comfortable design for both the mouse and keyboard , convenient button on keyboard make great shortcut , wireless capability top all I have see by not mess up with cell phone interference . overall amazing value , amazing product !!
Keyboard	NEG	2	first I preface by say I have have pc since the 80s . this be the first keyboard I ever use that will not work correctly . it refuse to be recogize by my win 7 64bit one-year old system even after a full bio update . to operate the keyboard I have to manually unplug it and then plug it back in . Tech support want I to change bio setting ... something I have never do for ANY keyboard . what be up with that ?? the Logitech board be also pepper with problem story about this product . needless to say , this one go on the shelf -lrb- have it too long to return it -rrb- and the trusty Microsoft keyboard come out of retirement .
Keyboard	POS	4	I be typing on it now and my initial response be that the key be too stiff for a device that require a bit of finesse due to its size . my keystroke do not always register . I be sure everyone will have a opinion about key placement but I personally find the single shift key -lrb- left side -rrb- and the placement of the apostrophe to be the biggest hindrance to comfortable , accurate typing . that say , it save a ton of desk space and seem to be make well . I would not recommend its use for anyone that do a lot of typing . Stick to the minus keyboard if you need to save space -lrb- in the 11-12 '' range vs. this one 's 9 '' -rrb- , unless you truly require something this small .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I will not go into technical detail but this be the worst phone I have ever have . I would expect more from a `` pda '' but this one have be on my crap list since day 1 of use it !
Keyboard	POS	5	I be hesitant to get this keyboard simply because of the price . I have it on my wish list for about six week . then I splurge and figure I could return it if I be not blow away . well , I be and have be . right out of the box I be amaze by how professional and slick it look . the after turn it and and see the black case with the white letter ... wow ... my friend have be amaze and be very envious . after connect with my pc wirelessly the keyboard be ready to rock . no cd 's , no have to read instruction , just a easy installation per sey ... this keyboard do everything and have everything you need . the shortccut on the fn key be amazing and everything just feel right ... I have a black hd set by Samasung and this key board go perfect with that and my black logitech everything mouse . I would highly reccommend this keyboard even at the high price ... quality , function and the bell and whistle come with this keyboard ...
Keyboard	NEG	2	the silicone keyboard cover do not let the backlit key show through , and while it do protect the keyboard from dust , it make typing somewhat awkward . if you like the crisp feel of the keyboard on you macbook pro , do not bother with this .
Keyboard	NEG	1	Bluetooth stop pick up frequently , and this thing eat battery . use 4 aa battery which last about 2 week .
Keyboard	NEG	1	it be a great keyboard , but there be no driver for os x user . the keyboard will work on you mac , but you will not be able to access\/assign any of the customizable button . many of the button have no default function for os x , so they do nothing . I have contact customer support to address the issue , but never get a answer to whether or not a driver be come in the future . on the plus side , if you run window through bootcamp on you mac , the keyboard work flawlessly .
Keyboard	POS	5	everyone be always jealous of my pink keyboard . it be so easy to peel off and wash and it keep I from go crazy when I have get something stick in-between a key . so simple yet chic .
Keyboard	POS	5	it work comfortably . the volume button and Next\/Previous be handy . it share the unifying receiver with other Logitech product , so it actually `` save '' my Logitech m510 mouse b\/c I lose the mouse receiver .
Keyboard	POS	5	this keyboard be a excellent replacement for a aging Logitech keyboard I have I would definitely buy again , but probably will not need to because from my experience Logitech product be build to last . pro - very sleek design , quick media key , volume etc. . con - none
Keyboard	POS	5	it be compact , and it just work ! I buy this to replace a similar one that come with my xtreamer Ultra PC that would not pair with it be usb stub . this new one work right out of the box . the only negative for I be that the touchpad be a bit awkward to use , but I just use a usb Logitech wireless mouse that I have and I be fine now . it be nice not to have to have a large keyboard sit next to I on the couch anymore .
Keyboard	POS	4	well , for the price , this be a nice , bare bone keyboard . it do type fairly quietly and have a nice tight feel to it , and the screen respond quickly to what be type . I do not give it 5 star because the letter on the key be start to fade . I will spend more money next time and -lrb- hopefully -rrb- get a keyboard that have better quality lettering .
Keyboard	NEG	1	okay the keyboard be overall fantastic . type like a dream as far as comfort and speed . the additional macro button and function key be a big help as well . however , and this be a big however , I have have a terrible experience so far with razer 's quality control as far as these board be concern . about a week ago the -lrb- leave ctrl -rrb- key on my several day old Razer Blackwidow -lrb- the standard edition , not the ultimate -rrb- just stop work , with no explanation whatsoever , so I swap it out for a old lycosa which I have be use before while I wait for my replacement to arrive -lrb- decide to upgrade to a ultimate from the standard because I want a backlight to help I type in the dark when I game at night -rrb- . so my new board arrive , and I discover shortly after unbox it that it have a second -lrb- t -rrb- key where the -lrb- y -rrb- key should be ... keep in mind that this the second issue I have have in less than a week , with they highest quality board , no less . LONG STORY SHORT , great BOARD , BUT be ready if razer 's quality CONTROL SCREWS you over !
Keyboard	POS	4	the keyboard be easy to use and it can be use from a long distance . the problem be that some time it loose the signal . the battery life be realy good and fast to charge again !!
Keyboard	POS	4	Works pretty good . my only complaint be they do not send the color I order but for the price they be pretty good .
Keyboard	POS	5	this product really do not leave anything else to be desire . it fit the keyboard on my 2010 MacBook pro perfectly and look great to boot . it sit flush to the key and play between key non-existant . this cover also give the key more of a texturized feel , which be a good change from the glossy stock key .
Keyboard	NEG	1	the key be label for Windows only . every time the Mac reboot , I have to re-identify the keyboard because the Mac do not recognize it . in addition , like most cheapo keyboard it have no extra usb port . the key be not that annoying , but they be annoying , especially if you move from keyboard to keyboard ; this one will always be the odd one out , with it be somewhat small and slant key . all in all , you would be much better off get a generic Windows keyboard at you local big box store . again : this should not be call Mac compatible , despite what be print on the box . I be simply glad I buy it at half its suggest retail price . this be the lowest rating I have ever give a product sell by Amazon .
Keyboard	POS	4	i buy this for my mac minus when i take the bluetooth keyboard and use it for my ipad 2 . after i sync the blue tooth keyboard to my ipad i need something to get past the password on start up . will use for other light typing but buy this one cheap since that will be the primary function .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have purchase this keyboard\/mouse combo many time for the business I work at , and it be honestly the best one I have see and use ... the ergonomic effect be not overwhelming and the surround shortcut key be great ! it have a great feel to it , also .
Keyboard	POS	4	this be a great little keyboard . it be small , light and just what I need to streamline typing large amount of text into my new Treo 650 smart phone . unfortunately , it cease to work at seemingly random time . sometimes it restart itself and sometimes it will not work unless I perform a soft reset . I do not know why it do this , but I wish Palm would fix it .
Keyboard	NEU	3	have it a few hour . so far it be okay . I be still get use to the subtle difference in key spacing , but none of the key be swap as other have report . I like the mechanical feel of the key , and even on the lowest set the backlighting be brighter than my old g15 . but they be loud - even louder than the Dell mechanical keyboard I use at work . plus , I do not like the style of the key at all . some letter be hardly recognizable ; they be not upper or lower case - they be just weird . but I know where everything 's at on a keyboard anyway , so I 'll probably get use to that . the thing I really dislike be the location of the extra usb port and audio jack . the right side be the last place a right hand person would ever want those jack . if use , the cable stick out right where I use my mouse , and the headset cable drape across where my right hand and arm be which I want to keep free . I can just not use these jack I guess , but this aspect of the design be so pathetic I can not even grasp how it come to fruition . what be also bad about this be the other end of the cable . if I only plug in the main usb connector , the other just hang there put strain on the one that \* be \* connect . if I connect the 2nd usb but do not use it , it waste that port on the back of my pc , and that be not even a option for the audio jack - I have to use they for the headset . so I 'll have to twist-tie the loose end to the case or some other cable or something . \*\* edit \*\* I come back to bump up my rating to 4 star because I find that this keyboard do something great . but then I also discover that another of its tout feature be so flaky it be basically useless , so the rating stay at 3 . okay , \* this \* be great . I find that it let you assign macro or alternate key function to almost ANY key - not just the extra macro key on the side like my g15 limit I to . this mean you can completely move a key around . when I play game , I use Ventrilo for voice chat , but I never really like where I have my left-side push-to-talk key . but with this keyboard , I be able to assign my PPT key to my cap lock key and cap lock to my PTT key - in effect swap they ! this be a simple but extremely powerful feature . however , after set up a profile with several swap key , I have ton of issue with the auto-profile switch feature . basically , it be very flaky . I play around with set the correct . exe to base the profile activation off of , and get it to work - sometimes . other time it just would not work at all . also , I find that when my custom profile activate sometimes it would just deactivate for no reason . but when I pull up the Razer utility from the system tray the checkbox would show as if it be still active . when I click on the profile from there to make it the active one , sometimes it would stay on , but most of the time it would activate and then just go back to the default one a few seconds later . the same thing happen when open up the main utility and select the profile from there . I even try unassign the . exe from my custom profile , and play with all of the option over and over . but basically , no matter what I do ... I could not even get it to stay on a custom profile when manually select it - that be HORRIBLE . I 'll try to completely delete the custom profile and re-create it or maybe even re-install the Razer app ... but I have a bad feeling that if I want the power of the swap key I 'll probably have to permanently swap they in the default profile and that stink , especially when my g\/f or someone else use my keyboard and try to use one of my swap key and get all screw up .
Keyboard	POS	4	if you be familiar with use ergonomic keyboard , you 'll probably like this model . I have be use a contoured keyboard for about 4 year . even though it take a while to get use to the contour , I now have trouble go back to the old straight style . I also like the feel of the key since I be a heavy-handed typer . I be replace this keywboard with a new one because several of the key be break , which be part of why I downgrade the keyboard . I do not think the key should have break off so easily . another issue I have be that it be quite large and use a lot of desk space . this may be just a function of any contoured board , but I think a little engineering would result in a better design .
Keyboard	POS	5	love the weight of the key . it be a sleek , basic look . own the product for three week . mouse be a little bulkier than I would like and scroll be not as smooth as most mouse . Perfect for my need and budget
Keyboard	NEG	1	I buy the HP Ultra Thin Wireless Keyboard for many reason : 1 -rrb- need a wireless keyboard 2 -rrb- need a fairly compact keyboard 3 -rrb- be already use a HP wireless mouse with link-5 , and do not want to add another usb receiver to my system 4 -rrb- price be right 5 -rrb- figure HP quality would be fine , for a keyboard when I get the thing , I could not get it to connect to my link-5 wireless receiver that come with my HP mouse . at first , I think the keyboard itself be defective . but then I try the receiver that come with the keyboard , and it work for the keyboard . but then my HP mouse would not connect . take I a while to figure out what be go on . there be two version of this keyboard , the old style -lrb- the one I be review -rrb- and the new style -lrb- the one I want , the one I think I order ! -rrb- the difference between the two be the receiver and the model number . this be bk114aa , the one you do not want . the one you might want to order be a0b42aa . that be the exact same keyboard , but it have the link-5 receiver . I be kind of upset that this be not make more clear in the advertising for this product . it be like have two car , one with a\/c and one without . but not be able to know which be which until after the sale ... -lrb- well that be a nasty surprise -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	5	this be easy to use and work well . I literally take the keyboard out of the box , insert the transceiver -lrb- which have a storage spot on the back of the keyboard -rrb- into a usb port on my computer , insert two AAA battery that be include into the keyboard and the keyboard start work . the keyboard be approximately 13 inch by six inch . this give I much more flexibility when I be work at my desk and have a bunch of papers in front of I . I can move the keyboard around my desk with ease . my only complaint be that the keyboard do not have little pullout leg that allow it to be raise at a angle . if I be rest the keyboard on my lap it be not a big deal but I be usually work at a desk and I be use to a keyboard at a angle . this be a great product at a good price . I do with be could be raise at a angle though .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I have use this keyboard enough to wear\/short out a couple ; useful and well-thought-out design . but my newest replacement have a mushy feel to the key -- no life in they . disappointing .
Keyboard	NEG	2	buy it and think it be great . then I notice that touchpad tap could not be disabled . nor could touchpad scrooling . talk to manufacturer , they say the device have no driver other than the microsoft pnp one and that these two feature be not available . this be a real problem if you do not hunt-n-peck type . if you type like you be suppose to for speed , this keyboard be problematic . the touchpad be extremely sensative -lrb- not changable -rrb- and if you inadvertently drag you thumb across it the cursor go all over the place , and so do you typing . until Adesso come up with a driver that can : 1 -rrb- disable tape on touchpad , 2 -rrb- disable scrool on touchpad , 3 -rrb- decrease sensativity of touchpad I would say this be a no-buy product . but it do have potential , just unrealized .
Keyboard	NEG	1	pick this up at a local store on the cheap . I read other reviewer complain about it looking\/feeling cheap . Umm ... it \* be \* cheap . all I want be a simple , usb keyboard with more action in the key than my current 10-year old keyboard . I look at the key location closely ... but not close enough . I get it all the way home and start write a letter before I realize that the bozo that design this keyboard take the `` pipe '' and `` backslash '' key -lrb- meaning '' | '' and '' \ '' -rrb- which be usually to the left of the `` right-shift '' button , and jam it between the backspace key and the + \/ = key . my question to the designer be ... why ???? you elongate the right-shift key to fill the space leave by remove the '' | '' and \ key , and you shorten the backspace key by half -lrb- put in the `` wrong '' place for touch typer -rrb- in order to jam the same '' | '' and \ key between the backspace and the + \/ = key . I love the feel and the price of the keyboard . everything else be just perfect -lrb- yeah , it be cheap construction ... but the price be cheap as well -rrb- . I do not get it . I be take this keyboard back immediately . oh , and as for those who might not care about the backspace key , if you plan on use this keyboard for gaming , then I also have to agree with the other reviewer that you will probably be better serve by one that be a bit more `` rugged '' . this keyboard will not stand up to any abuse from the look of it . the biggest problem I can cite -lrb- as other reviewer have as well -rrb- be that the cable be ridiculously thin and no doubt fragile . I doubt it be reinforce at the connector or keyboard end at all . for a cheap keyboard , it would have work well ... if the key have be in the correct location .
Keyboard	NEG	1	not only do this have the OVERHEATING and NOT be transparent issue but it rip right out of the box . it be fold , so when i try to unfold it , it just rip . do not . get . this .
Video_Games	NEU	3	at first I be a bit disappointed that this be not a real rpg like BG or bg2 . dark Alliance -lrb- DA -rrb- be more a action rpg like the Diablo game . DA have great graphic and music -lrb- far better than Diablo 2 -rrb- and be pretty addictive . it do not make a real impact though . a solid action rpg , but nothing really special .
Video_Games	NEU	3	I really look at these ` activity center ' software package for my kid . unfortunately there be not much to go on with this one . the graphic be nice , but the activity get old after about 20 minute . my 6 year old plow thru this and get tire of it after 30 minute ! this be one of those software program that you be better off wait to buy it when its in the discount rack .
Video_Games	POS	5	the product be receive accord to the list in excellent condition and on time . I be satisfy because it be a good purchase and good gift tk .
Video_Games	POS	5	have lose many hour of sleep playing this game . love the update of the franchise as far as the uus and gameplay go
Video_Games	POS	5	as Stephen King 's Number one fan -lrb- wink , wink -rrb- , I can only say how awesome it be to have Stephen King 's f13 run on my computer . it be gory graphic and creepy sound be just what I would expect from the `` king of horror '' . my particularly favorite feature be have Stephen King in a corner of my screen clack away at a new story in real-time . that and a new -lrb- lengthy -rrb- short story . I will not give too much away , but it be one of he creepier one . I would definitely recommend this product to a friend .
Video_Games	POS	5	the Starter Bundle make it quick and easy for those who already have a PS3 to get a idea of what move be about . depend on what you already have on you PS3 and of what\/how you be plan to play , all you may need could be just the move controller and nothing else or you may want to order some additional controller instead of this bundle . if you do not have a PS3 , then the  PlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation move bundle  what you get , what else you MAY NEED\/WANT briefly , this be what you get in with this bundle and I will make it very short because there be a lot of info . at the Amazon page : \* move controller , of course \* PlayStation Eye camera -lrb- must have for the move to work -rrb- \* Sports Champions -lrb- Ping Pong be simply awesome , some of the game play much better with a second controller -rrb- \* a disc with demo which should be available at the PSN store as well depend on how you be plan to play you game , this be what you do not get but may end up buy eventually : - one more additional move controller -lrb- some game will either require two controller or will play better with two -rrb- - Navigation Controller -lrb- s -rrb- -lrb- you can use the DualShock in you left hand but it feel weird -rrb- - one or more extra usb wire if you do not have enough already to charge you new controller -lrb- s -rrb- or - dedicate charger , especially if you have more than one move controller and\/or Navigation controller -lrb- s -rrb- go for the starter bundle or not ? the Motion Controller and the PS Eye be the minimum need to bring ` move ' to a any PS3 console . no exception . if you already have a PS Eye then the controller alone be the only purchase necessary . on the other hand , to fully enjoy certain game , you may want two move controller . this starter bundle make sense if you do not have the Eye already and you be into the type of game that Sports Champions have . you could still get it and then sell the Eye if you already have one . the same go for the Sports Champions . it come seal so you can sell it as ` new ' and recover some fund in the process . move 's motion controller the Wikipedia have a very thorough review of the technology inside the controller - impressive . it be probably worth go there to get a idea of what be under the hood . from a user 's point of view , the move could be view as approximately the right side of the DualShock 3 where the motion tracking function be the r3 analog stick , r1 be the move button and the r2 become the move 's t -lrb- rigger -rrb- . you also get the 4 square\/circle\/x \/ Triangle , in a square -lrb- not ` diamond ' -rrb- formation , the PS button as well as the START and SELECT . so far , the most used button during gameplay be the move and the t -lrb- rigger -rrb- . in addition , you get a wrist strap . at the opposite end of the microphone-shaped move there be a usb mini-b port for charge and another port that seem to be proprietary - must investigate . the controller be quite substantial as far as both size and weight - I like that and like its be shape in a way that make it easy to grab and hold . very much like a microphone or a very thick magic wand ; NOT a remote control . base on my experience so far , move 's ability to track you motion far surpass anything that I be aware of in the gaming universe . every single movement , up\/down , left\/right , toward\/away and wrist rotation be accurately capture and almost instantly reflect on the screen and so be acceleration that would usually translate as ` force ' in game such as sword fight or ping pong . in addition , there be haptic -lrb- tactile\/rumble -rrb- feedback , a little too weak in the game I play so far , make the gaming experience that much more realistic . I be not write a lot about the Eye camera because ... it be just there and it be not the subject of this review . for as long as it can see you , it simply do its part so that you may enjoy you game . the GAME Sports Champions consist of 6 separate event where you play through one of the available character either against the other character provide by the game or against another player - will need a second move controller for that . as expect , there be level of difficulty , medal and various bonus . ping pong show move 's nothing short of amazing ability to track its controller position in 3d space and , better , even detect move such as wrist rotation and to track acceleration as ` force ' and do it in real time . play Ping Pong be challenging , fun , frustrating and addictive . my entire arm , from wrist all the way up to the neck hurt already and I be not even do with the bronze medal challenge yet -lrb- almost there -rrb- . ARCHERY be probably second most popular , at least in we household . we like it because , unlike PING PONG , we do not sweat a lot while play it . ARCHERY be also one of the 3 include game that make it quite clear that you will be much better off with two Motion Controllers . some of the challenge look quite cheesy - shooting at float money bag but we have spend some time play it and it be likely that we be go to play some more in the future . the GLADIATOR sword fight game , even more than ARCHERY would benefit from two Motion Controllers - one for the sword\/axe and a second for a shield . with one controller only , you must pull the trigger to raise and use you shield or use the sword otherwise . yes , Sony give we button but the game be ten time more realistic when you actually push you shield forward the way you would actually do it in real life rather than pull the trigger to raise the shield and , at the same time push the move button while make a ` push ' motion . BOCCE ... ever play it ? I have a couple of time . Plays well with one controller but it can be a little boring . good simulation . FRISBEE golf be not bad . actually play it in real life on the course we have at the nearby state park . it be a little slow but it be good relaxation after you sweat yourself out on PING PONG or GLADIATOR . VOLLEYBALL , again , can be so much better with two Motion Controllers . also , be careful if you play in a room with low ceiling or anything that hang from the ceiling like a ceiling fan or a priceless crystal candelabrum . consider that Sports Champions be a early game , my expectation be not that high but , surprisingly , Ping Pong exceed my expectation . I have be play real Ping Pong ever since I be 11 or 12 so I probably know what I be talk about and the move version of Ping Pong be GOOD . as for the other ... sword fight , not so good . Archery be okay , Bocce be so-so , Frisbee Golf not too bad . for the game I have play so far , this be not a couch experience . on the Sports event I be sweating after a few minute and my move arm be now hurt from the wrist all the way up to the neck . MY RATING it be 5 star for the technical merit , ease of setup and for the overall experience . hopefully , lot of good game will be come quickly .

Video_Games	POS	5	I buy this controller a few month after I buy my GameCube , about 4 year ago . this controller have work great ever since ! it be only now after year of abuse that it be start to malfunction . so if you want a good , durable controller , this be well worth the money !
Video_Games	POS	5	I do not know what people be complain about , this be the first time that we see a non `` save the world from the ancient evil '' type story . although I admit that strip away some feature from DA : o be a bad idea for Bioware , there some clear step forward like intertaction between party member , lack of clear good or evil char and many more be definetly a plus in my book !
Video_Games	POS	4	I have play this game a fair amount since release and feel I can give a review on my initial impression on the game . it be a mmo so the game will evolve over time , so some of my statement may no longer be relevant after patch be release . pro : + Graphics + soloable -lrb- party be still faster -rrb- + in depth , skill base craft system + storyline + music + extremely large zone , you will rarely come across zone line con : - uus lag for npc interaction , change equipment , and craft - no auction House\/Market search -lrb- detail below -rrb- - teleport consume Anima , you gain enough Anima for 1 to 1.5 teleport a day - chat system be clunky , and linkshell -lrb- guild -rrb- chat can easily be lose in battle spam -lrb- you deal x damage to y monster -rrb- . filter be avalible , but not complete . - content lock out currently . ishgard -lrb- the new Jeuno for FFXI player -rrb- be close . you can not ride chocobo yet . no airship . this make travel time consuming , and no central place for meeting people . - uus do not improve over XI , pretty much the same -lrb- just more\/different menu option -rrb- . - Account management be clunky beyond belief . I would also like to hit on a few point that have people worry before release . the biggest be probably the fatigue system where people be afraid that se would limit you play time . well , I can tell you that unless you be a power leveler -lrb- as in play all day every day -rrb- you will not hit the limit . you can get into the 20 's for rank within a single week , the cap for the game be currently 50 . so if 3 week be too long to reach max level ... then I guess the fatigue system will be a problem for you . for we mortal who must sleep however it be not something you be likely to run into . level pace be extreamly fast for the first 10 rank , once you hit rank 10 however you hit a wall and thing slow down , a lot . I also want to go into more detail on one of my con , the lack of a auction house\/search system . in this game almost all you equipment will come from crafter . not drop . not buy from npc shop . this give crafter in the game a real purpose , and I like that because I enjoy craft . this be completely opposite to game like WoW where the vast majority of craft goods be ` useless ' in comparison to dungeon drops\/quest reward . to sell item you can create a npc retainer who act like a shop keeper . you put they in a area that act like a market square where other player can walk around and view each shop . there be no way to search who be sell what , or who be buy what . you have to go through each retainer , one by one , and there be thousand of they . you be look at significant time to search through a sea of stuff you do not want to try and find the item you need ... at a price you can afford . the problem with this be all the craft be dependent on each other . want to make a spear as a blacksmith ? you 'll need a carpenter to make the shaft , and the carpenter will need raw wood from a botanist . you 'll also need some leather for the grip , which you get from a leather worker , who need chemical from a alchemist to cure the hide . you can see how this be go , if you want to make something you need to buy component from other crafter -lrb- or level that craft yourself -rrb- . with no auction house or market search feature it be near impossible to find the item you need , which make craft gear near impossible , which mean once you get into the teens for rank , and certainly into the 20 's , you gear be really start to hurt you . that be my biggest complaint with the game . se have say they have something ready -lrb- either ah or search feature -rrb- but they be wait to see what player do with the economy ... this be really stupid in my opinion as this issue be turn a lot of people away from they game , include I . fix this one issue and my rating of the game will increase a substantial amount . my recommendation would be to wait to purchase this game until they have fix the ah\/market search problem . once that be fix , it really have the potential to be a great mmorpg . -lrb- small note on collector 's edition . the NA crowd get shaft big time compare to EU . we get less stuff -lrb- know before purchase -rrb- but also the journal be crap compare to the EU one . -rrb- update 9\/29\/2010 : Square-Enix have announce plan to re-do the market ward . they 'll name each ward towards specific category of equipment\/items and any item sell in that ward that fall under its category will have a reduce tax . player be not force to sell only that category goods though . they plan to implement this in 1 to 2 week . I can see this improve the situation , but not entirely solve it . since each player be currently limit to a single retainer you can expect the category to only be loosely follow . se plan to allow player to have multiple retainer , but likely at a real world cost of $ 1\/extra retainer -lrb- this price be announce long ago before the game release -rrb- . I will personally probably get 2 extra retainer to make the game cost be $ 14.99 which be equal to other pay to play MMO 's . it should be note that each retainer have a 80 item capacity so the more you have , the more storage you have also . UPDATE : 7\/27\/2011 : well , it have be almost a full year -lrb- 10 month -rrb- since launch and I can say this game have see major improvement . it be still not quite there , but it be a much better game than what we first see . the market ward have a nice search feature , that include price . it will even place a icon next to the Retainers name so you can easily find they in the ward . Shopping be a much much more enjoyable experience now . I still think a ah style in the way of ffxus would be better -lrb- game would not have to load thousand of retaienr - obvious lag -rrb- . combat have have lot of improvement , most recently the removal of fatigue and stamen , and the addition of you time honor auto-attack . since stamen be remove you special skill now work off cool-down timer like you be use to from ffxus and other mmo 's . craft for local levequest be now much faster since it give you a repeat option . no more need to go through you menu every single time . it also remember that last few thing you have craft for quicker access . repair have be greatly simplify , a single material type be now need for every equipment type call dark matter . no more need to carry around , or find , several different type -lrb- for example cloth fent , tree branch , ore , metal , etc -rrb- to keep you armor and weapon in good shape . they have add nm and also have start add quest to the game that fall outside of the basic levequest the game start with . there be still very few of these though . you can tell from the patch note and the letter from the producer that they be put the framework in for questing hub like you 'll find in most popular MMO 's that will be a welcome addition . they have add the hub , but not the quest yet . they have also add two instanced dungeon -lrb- they call they raid , but I think that be a bit much for what they be -rrb- that require party to complete . I have decide to bump my review up a star to 4\/5 due to all they change they have make . the final star can be earn once they flesh out the quest to add content to keep it from be a mindless grindfest to level , and once they finally add alternative mode of transportation -lrb- airship and chocobo at a minimum -rrb- .

Video_Games	POS	4	this game rock . I have be play consule base game for year and I put this drive simulator really high on my chart . the drive dynamic with a force feed wheel be pretty great . after install the game get the latest free mod and patch of the internet from free share server . if the game do not have a track , then thier a possibility of find the track at a file server . I have drive on the real world famous Nurburgring race track more time than I can count on my finger and compare to other game with the same track none of they scare I more like the real track then gtr 2 . I own all of the Grand Turismo and both of the forza motorsport and be really happy with this game . the only low be no street car and no after market part . but if you remember this game be base on gt series racing you 'll get over the fact that you favorite street car be not here . get a force feed wheel and get ready to sweet as you keep from wreck you ride .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I purchase this game after have be deceive by the hype -lrb- the realism -rrb- and I be very much disappointed ... to the point I will likely never purchase ANYTHING make by ea again . First of all , they have do away with prone completely . how many soldier refuse to `` hit the deck '' when they be under fire ? that be strike one against this supposedly realistic game . the mission game be too simple ... 4 hour to beat if you be a noobie . the graphic have problem -lrb- lot of tear -rrb- as well as the multi-player have severe spawn issue -lrb- they respawn you into the same place every time so sniper can rack up kill easily -rrb- . additionally , the server for the multi-player seem to crash all the time . then recently they make change to the game in which a full on , dead center mass shot from a sniper rifle will not kill , but only wind a player . additionally , you can shoot they in the head and we still do not have a confirm kill every time . save you money , wait for the next round of game to come out , and then rent they first to make sure they do not suck like this one do . I be not happy about be out the $ 60 and to tell you how bad it be , Gamestop as well as most other company have stop buy they back because they have so many sellback .

Video_Games	NEG	2	after play the game with my cousin and read the online review I would have to say that this game pretty much suck the big one . OMG , Bungie , what the hell be you think put this game out there after we , the buyer , have to wait 2 + yr to play . I mean do not get I wrong , the graphic , the voice-over and the weapon be awesome . but , the end ? come on now , I save up big time to get this and have pre-order month in advance to receive the `` game of the year '' please ! the original , Halo , beat this one in to . also , I do not like playing between the Convenant and as Master Chief . pick one side and stick with it . they should make it like this : First play as Master Chief then after beat the game as a human give the option to play as the convenant or maybe ... the Flood . oh , Bungie , if you be read this : make a end that the gamer will like and not one the blow .
Video_Games	POS	5	the kid really love use this mic with the ps2 Karaoke game . Works well .
Video_Games	NEG	1	this game be great fun as long as you like make content and then watch it on screen . the game play be very simplistic . cell stage game play be a flash game with pretty graphic . creature stage be like Diablo but water down with very few ability and repetitive game play . Tribal and civ stage be akin to RTS game , but lack the depth and variety of game such as sin of a solar empire or warcraft 3 . space stage be basically the first few stage over and over but with a space ship throw in . this be say I really do like playing . create a creature\/building\/vehicle , and then watch it do its thing be very satisfying . bottom line , if you like goof off and play with spore like a toy its fun . however if you be look for a deep combat system , complex rt strategy develop , or think provoke game play this game be not for you . the simplistic game play couple with outrageous DRM and the ea sporepedium server be very buggy -lrb- will not upload some creature -rrb- , this game need lot of work to be a fun game . the editor be already fantastic . stage need to be flesh out with more abilities\/vehicles\/strategy \/ etc. . DRM need to be do away with or make less crazy -lrb- 3 install you be basically rent the game for 50 usd -rrb- securom need to be do away with -lrb- it kill a CD rom drive on a old pc of mine . for the average gamer I would say stay away for now or wait for bargain bin price .

Video_Games	NEG	1	bf3 be a very generic shooter with up-to-date graphic and sound . single player mode be simply junk , multi-player mode lack all the feature that make , for example , bf2 so much fun : shooter combine with great teamwork , tactic and strategy . single player : you be a actor play a very rigid and linear script . you be tell all the time what to do , there be nothing to explore , no choice on how to perform you task . you simply need to follow the step by step direction , until you die , at which point you restart from a few step back . actually you do have some liberty : you can choose the order in which you can kill the enemy present to you . I can recall many game from 20 year ago , that would fit on a single floppy disk and that be much more exit . multi-player : I will compare it mostly with bf2 : there be no more teamwork . not at squad level and certainly not at team level . there be no more voip in game . if you plan to hook up with some random people in the game and play and chat for a couple hour in a squad , bad luck . it will be just plain silent shooting , and wonder what the squad mate do and think . no easy way to communicate . all weapon work very well at long range - so everything become a matter of discover the adversary at long range in the very cluttered environment . if you move , you will almost certainly be kill by someone hide somewhere . the map be very large , which mean that unless you play long hour you will be continuously confuse by you location and where you killer might be . there be no more commander ! so no more unity as a team , no more direction and unify strategy - at least not easily if you join a random server . no more asset such as radar , artilery , UAV . the user interface : again bf2 be mile ahead , simple easy to use , instantly understandable . bf3 : clutter , annoy in short , save you money ! if you like Bad Company 2 you might like this one as well , but if you be a bf2 fan for the reason enumerate in the first paragraph , than bf3 will be a waste of money . real waste , since of course one can not resell the game - it will become tie to you ea origin account . I certainly regret order it in advance , instead of wait for the first unbiased review .
Video_Games	NEU	3	my kid like the collection of old game best . he only complaint be that there be a lot of the same game in the different collection . have be around to play many of these in the arcade the reproduction look pretty good . Wish they have PSP 's when I be a kid .
Video_Games	NEG	2	like most thing its good in theory , but not in practice . the game lag , the control be simply horrible on the pc version at least . I have high hope for this game after all they hype , but there be simply too much stop and go to progress the story along . even the patch be bug for the pc and will not complete the update . if this do turn into a mmorpg and the bug fix , it may deserve another look . for now I waste 50.00 on a subpar game .
Video_Games	NEG	2	after many frustrating attempt to install the power tool , I go to the Hasbro website and find out that you can only play the game with the mouse if you have Windows xp ... what a bummer this be to my six and four year old son . they still have fun play it with the mouse , but it be not they first choice . thankfully , I order this when it be 50 % off , or Tonka Joe would really be on my list !!
Video_Games	POS	4	this game be fun . it be certainly not a great game but it be a fun game for a 10 or so hour ride to get a platinum trophy . the No fear of Heights trophy be a pain in the ass and take I around 50 try but I finally get it . I hate trophy that be base on pure luck . it be b.s. however , when you get it you be totally pump with excitement . the gameplay be redundant and I find myself use the same combo for 90 % of the game . later in the game I mostly use the butt\/body bounce to weaken the enenmy then a quick slash to finish off the zombie . the boss be not difficult at all but this game go beyond the three time boss fight to win . one boss -lrb- Zed , I think -rrb- take like five time to hurt , then another four of 5 time to finish . Sheesh , that be aggravate . this game be rate mature 17 for a reason ... definitely not for kid -lrb- even though they probably already hear it all -rrb- . there be lot of sexual innuendo and Juliet be quite provocatively dress ... especially if you upgrade all costume -lrb- seashell bikini -rrb- . there be panty peek the entire game with one trophy be look up Juliet 's skirt . it be not gross or demeaning it be in the realm of a college party movie like Animal House or Porky 's . the game make I laugh out loud at a few point with the silly college humor . I would rate this game around a 7 or so because it be fun . it take at least two play through -lrb- or chapter select -rrb- to platinum . I have to do it a few more time because when gather up trophy and collectible after the initial play through , I should have play on rank mode . I do not figure that out till the second play through so I have to do all the rank chapter again . my bad . you live and you learn . in my opinion this be certainly not a $ 60 game . I would be a little peeved if i payed over $ 30 . I do , but then sell it and it wind out cost I around $ 11 . perfect !!! the game be break up with minus game which be just fill but mostly still enjoyable . during gameplay , try to be sure and hit all the correct button in the qte for collectible wrapper and extra gold coin . it be need for some trophy . one other trophy which at first be a pain be go medal racer . it be not that hard once you figure out a plan . when it come to the part that split left and right I stop , line up with the coin on the lower level right and bam ... one try get everything safely and avoid the fall building . after many try it be simple once I figure that part out . I be pretty sure you will enjoy this if you arent expect a top notch game like uncharted . it be light hearted , college fun that occupy you time for 10 + hour . Story be ok even though I really do not pay much attention . there be 6 chapter plus a prologue . there be no save besides auto save . in rank mode you must complete the entire chapter without get kill or you need to start from the beginning of the chapter . use you health -lrb- lollipop -rrb- and sparkle wisely and sparingly . I do not recommend start rank mode until you be comfortable with the controls\/game for this reason . you will be really upset if you get 43 minute in and then die . yes you will have to start all over . that sux . you need to learn combo for maximum point to beat Dad 's score in rank mode . it be not that hard once you get use to the game . I do recommend this game but wait until the price drop or buy it and then flip it on a auction site or here on Amazon . if you be not expect a whole lot you wont be disappoint . the soundtrack be also quite good so enjoy that also . have fun ...

I didnt care for it , some bad voice act and some pretty good voice act . you wont remember the story after you play . . hell im still play it and I dont remember the story . the camera angel be bad and at the end of the month you feel this be a game for poor or the average income people . if you be rich and want a mmorpg , buy world of warcraft , I want soo much to play but im only 16 and itll take up almost all my allowence .

Video_Games	POS	5	I buy this game out of a knee-jerk reaction-i think that burnout 3 be the best in the series and the new one due to come out look even better . Legends be basically a port of burnout 3 but with new game mode -lrb- I think it also have new car -rrb- . still , the game play great and be translate over to the psp flawlessly . all the mode you know and love be there , plus a new one , pursuit , which remind I of the relic nf mode where you be the cop chase the criminal . the graphic be awesome and be some of the best I have see so far , be so early in the lifespan of the psp . the control be easy to use , with the d-pad and analog stick be both available to use . d Braking and accelerate be not too wild , which I think be in NFS Underground rival . the car drive just like NFSU rival , so if you have play NFS , you will have no proplem adjust to the game . overall it be fun and will bring you fun in the middle of rush hour traffic that `` drive '' my parent crazy . for a port , this game do not really seem like one , just a brand new game itself .

Video_Games	POS	5	I have be play the Nancy Drew game for a few year now , and have find that with each one the graphic , intrigue & fun just keep get better & better . in `` danger by design '' Nancy agree to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette 's House of Fashion . he be nervous because Minette have begin act very strangely & have fall way behind on she new spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture . once there , Nancy become aware of several threatening letter the designer have receive , as well as a number of rumor concern artwork that have be steal during World War II that may be hide in the old wind Mill that now serve as Minette 's House of Fashion . could they be relate some how ? as Nancy Drew , you will find yourself snoop around for clue , work to earn the money need to buy several need item , solve various puzzle , and ultimately put all the information together to solve the mystery surround Minette & the steal artwork . overall , I love `` danger by design '' . it have the best graphic to date for a nd game & it be great fun to play . I would highly recommend it to anyone who have enjoy play other such game , as well as those who enjoy -lrb- or be enjoy -rrb- read the nd series .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I be 59 year old and have be use computer extensively for over 35 year . I buy the PS3 to play br disc and to watch Netflix . the PS3 user interface be horrible . I have to guess and use trial & error to try to use the unit . most all older Americans will never be able to use it . I be recommend to my friend to get a PS3 for Netflix . now I do not . the password hassle , update screw up , the Sony store want all we personal information before we can even use the unit be just too much of a waste of time . I go to the Sony website to get more operating instruction . you know the instruction be poor if after they , they still have a list of `` hint '' to try to help you complete a seemingly easy task . I think the PS3 be probably a good machine , but DOS be easier to use . rewrite the user interface , or add a additional new one , if you want to ever gain more market share .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I love Halo on the Xbox . truly the first or second best shooter on any platform . `` half life on the pc be the other contender '' . on my Multimedia super killer Dell wide screen notebook with the new Pentium m processor , Nvidia FX 5650 go Video with 128 mb video RAM and 1 gig of main memory , Halo performance be abysmal .  i figure the other who say this may have be a bit over the top . they werent ! for Microsoft to have release this piece of drek be irresponsible in the extreme . it be the full Halo game and if you set to the higher resolution , the scenery be gorgeous , but , but , but !  unfortunately , even with virtually all the pretty video feature turn off and resolution set down to a abysmal 800x600 , the massive frame rate -lrb- and motion update -rrb- slowing -lrb- to as bad as less than 1 frame per second -rrb- that take place whenever major scene motion occur -lrb- especially in the middle of gunfight and always during in battle reloading -rrb- . make the game practically unplayable . I complete Halo on the Xbox in normal and heroic mode . but the pc version in standard mode be go to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update be so bad . really , really bad .  there be thing that could have be do to fix these issue before release , but let face it with halo2 loom , Microsoft have to dump it out here now to have any chance of sell it at all . half Life work on the pc and have a truly excellent interface . they do use lower resolution figure and scenery , but the whole thing work together . halo on the pc be on the other end of that spectrum .  do NOT BUY THIS GAME , IT be AWFUL ! go out and buy a xbox and get Halo for it . xbox Halo , alone be worth buy a xbox for . the only thing of value in the pc version be the Box it come in .

Video_Games	NEG	1	the graphic and gameplay be absolutely stunning even on low . that if you can get to that part . this game be very hard to handle . during my time with this product I have encounter white screen of death -lrb- game freeze with a white screen -rrb- , key in use error and so much more . it be almost impossible to get to the good stuff . during the campaign at the end of the first mission i encounter a white screen which make I restart my computer . Them when i give up try to finish the campaign due to all the white screen i attempt multiplayer . that do not work out either . I try over 20 time to enter my game key on my ea account but apparently it be already in use . also because ea have horrible customer support for it be game i do not recomend this game for the pc . any other platform it work fine . I myself have play it on xbox360 and ps3 and it be incredible . for pc not so much especially with all the hassle i have to go through to get the game to work . I end up return my copy for pc . it be a waste of my time to attempt play this on the pc .
Video_Games	POS	5	this be one of the best game I have ever play . if you play the first Kingdom Hearts and think that be fun , wait until you play this one . it be amazing . the storyline be wonderful and keep you wonder how everything happen . the game start off slow and make you think the first one be better , but once you get pass the begin it get so much more fun than the first one . I definitely recommend play this .

Video_Games	NEG	1	the product appear well-built . it be far more advance than the 3d . the game , however , be another story . I regret buy this console . it be at home gathering dust . I should have wait until good game come out . so , my advice be not to buy this product just yet .
Video_Games	POS	5	Bethesda be notorious for well make open world game , though there be some bug ; the few I have run across be minor and not game breaking . buy skyrim , kiss you family goodbye and enter skyrim ...
Video_Games	POS	4	this game be awesome and if I would have actually pay full price for it ... it still would have be underprice in my opinion . obviously this be one of those game that if you not into rpg 's you might not like it , but at the same time if you simply new to RPG 's and enjoy fp ' then this be a great game for you to get start with . story : without spoil anything I will just say this . the story be well write and play out very nicely . also the freedom to sort of `` direct '' you conversation and certain action that you take make the replay value of this game fairly high . you can pursue a romantic interest with ally or keep it all professional . you have the chance to win over the loyalty of you teammate but you can fail and some of the situation 's that involve gain ally `` loyalty '' may cause you player reputation to look bad , but you have full control over the path you take . Gameplay : it may take some get use to , but it be very easy to learn the control . the player movement be pretty smooth imo and the aus -lrb- you ally -rrb- do a pretty decent job during combat situation . -lrb- some character be better than other but the longer the game go on the more ally you get to choose from -rrb- . overall I give this game a 4\/5 -lrb- really a 4.5 -rrb- instead of a 5 only because the character interaction get a little repetitive after a while . -lrb- during the game while not on a mission you can go talk to various character , but most usually repeat the same thing over and over again until you have complete certain mission -rrb- . would recommend this game to everyone who enjoy a good shooter and the fact that it be RPG make it better since the storyline be so extensive .
Video_Games	POS	5	there be a very thorough review for the Wii version of the game , so I take a chance that the d version would be as good for my two boy -lrb- 5 & 8 -rrb- . we just receive the game yesterday and so far they have have a lot of fun play it . the quest seem very simple -lrb- just go to the next place with the big yellow star -rrb- so even though my 5 year old can not read he can still do just fine with it . they start play it and then ask for some help , so I be not sure if they miss some of the clue or if there be better direction in the box , but it do take we a little while to figure out the strategy for gain new attack and how best to use strategy when fight the other dragon . my boy love modify character , so have a place to customize they dragon be great and they love simple battle game . from what I remember , the Wii review fit what we be see with the d version too . the only complaint they have have so far be that the multi-player seem to be just to battle each other , which I would have expect , and not to hep each other along on they quest . give the simple nature of the `` quest '' I do not think do it together would work , but that be a kid 's perspective . it be not like the detailed quest you do in Lego game like Star Wars or Indiana Jones , which they enjoy do together and have in mind for `` multiplayer '' experience .

Video_Games	NEU	3	edit - add one star due to additon of more hardcore game mode on Mulitplayer . it be still no mw though ... this game do seem like a step backwards from mw2 . the single player aspect do not keep I interested long enough to finish it , but most will buy this for the multiplayer anyway , and here 's my thought on it : GOOD : - commando\/lightweight be go , no more get knife as you be shoot someone - killstreak reward kill do not count towards next killstreak . - I like the purchasing system for weapons\/attachments etc. . but you still have to unlock the weapon by level - have not run into any glitching . nobody hiding in rock , under the ground , or float a mile in the sky -lrb- so far -rrb- - the ability to revive down team mate BAD : - lot of lagging and bad connection . my connection be fine on other game , so it be not just I ... - spawn system be terrible . Random enemy spawn directly behind you , no matter where you be - it take too many round to get a kill on core . damage threshold need to be lower a bit - there be not enough hardcore game mode -lrb- where be hardcore headquarters ?? -rrb- - sound be not very good at all . I should ` nt have to get shoot by a helicopter to notice that it be there . - dog unrealistically too hard to kill -lrb- especially on hardcore . I can kill a man with one shot but not a dog ? lol -rrb- - map be fairly small with not much for sniper to do . there should be at least a couple good snipe map . - no real incentive to prestige imo . not that I 'll put nearly the time into this as I do on mw\/mw2 I think it be a pity that this break the initial sale record for mw2 . it do ` nt deserve it . I hope they can patch some of the issue , but if mw3 be come out next week , I would dump this and move on .
Video_Games	POS	5	I have the game for almost a year and just start to play it . I get my husband hook also and he be up until the next morning play it . recommend this to all and we be in we 30 's .
Video_Games	POS	4	First off . yes you get a tutorial . the first hour or so be completely on training wheel , and after that hour you get introduce to new mechanic as they come up , complete with context pop up . tired of the abrupt manticore fight and dragon movie everytime you start a new character ? too bad . want to just skip all of it and start at the first riftstone ? too bad . already know how to issue command ? too bad , they be get explain again ? why ? tutorial ! every review I have read cries\/praises the lack of a turorial as if this game be somehow the deep end of the pool . sorry , it be there and the learning curve be not all that scary . this be not Demon 's soul . challenge level in combat feel about right for I . I be not get Amalur Carpal tunnel , nor be I boring my way through final Fantasy autocombat . there be not a lot of micromanage in combat , so unless you have some tandem move , the AI be go to take and keep control of you minion . you can configure you minion AI to a extent , though not on the fly . also , since it isnt list anywhere - you can change the vocation of you main character and main pawn , and change back to any unlock vocation with no lose progress . -lrb- if I max out my main pawn as a fighter , then change he to a wizard , he 'll go right back to be a max out fighter should I change he back -rrb- . the Pawn Mechanic be definately what set the game apart . you 'll learn new tactic from visit pawn , and you main pawn will benefit while in other people game . since visit pawn dont level up with you , you 'll need to continually shop around for the ` perfect ' pawn to accompany you . you can rate a pawn and gift the owner on the release of one , and it be do in a pretty complimentary manner . if you lack a internet connection , there be already a large number of pawn ingame for recruiting . the graphic be pretty solid , voice acting be ok . the story be not this big gripping epic , it be a backdrop to start you off and to eventually finish you with . everything that come between be standard wow quest fare . there be no real multiplayer to speak of , but you 'll need a internet connection to access the pawn create by other player , and the group effort fight like the Ur-Dragon . the camera like to hide you . . not nearly as much as Amalur , but it be there . the quest\/map interface be a little clunky , but still serviceable . it also autoformat into widescreen , so you may be stick with formatting bar .
Video_Games	POS	5	I hate halo until i actually play it !

Video_Games	POS	5	the early generation of controller be make of some kind of plasticy glossy slippery material , and it be a struggle to keep the controller in you hand , but this controller be different . it have like a matte finish which will fit firmly in you hand and when you be play aggressive game where you have to screw the analog stick ; like Street Fighter , Fifa , tekken . . etc , the controller will not slip out of you hand . I would definitely recommend this if you have and older dualshock 3 , because they have change alot since they first come out .

Video_Games	POS	5	remarkable as it be , Naughty Dog have not have a single game that one would call `` terrible '' . while some be consider more worthwhile then other , they track record be pretty impressive . with the release of Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune , the team develop a beautiful and fun if a tad derivative game that help encourage the more `` cinematic '' approach to game design . then enter uncharted 2 : among thief . practically a seminal milestone in gaming , beat the game and run into somebody who have not play it yet prompt a `` oh man , you have gotta play it ! '' reaction . stunning graphic with believable motion capture , excellent voice act with some truly stellar set-piece , I would almost go and say uncharted 2 nary have a single fault in its narrative -lrb- other than blue cat people but I digress -rrb- . which make walk into the 3rd game , Drake 's Deception , kind of a tricky situation I be sure not only for fan but for the team . will they try to outdo everything the 2nd game do ? can you really outperform `` perfection '' ? well uncharted 3 be kind of in the middle : it do nearly everything the 2nd game do but better and yet can still leave one with a feeling of deja vu , albeit a impressive deja vu . 2 year after the event of among thief , the game open with Drake and Sully attempt to solve a riddle from one of Sir Francis Drake 's voyage , a voyage believe to end with the city of Ubar , the iram of the Pillars or the `` Atlantis of the Sands '' . Drake globetrot from the London underground to a chateau in France to the arabian desert as he search for this mystical city , all the while friend around they be question why be it that he always pursue reckless endeavor for treasure and do not see how it affect he friend and love one . the leap from the first game to the second be pretty extraordinary and not just on a graphical front . the seamless transition of cinematic , gameplay and even event that would have likely be quicktime event or non-interactive be something to behold . that leap to this game be not as grand a leap since now we pretty much know what Naughty Dog be capable of and while what you be see will not have the `` oh my god , how do they even do this ? '' reaction , it be still mighty impressive stuff . a ship capsizing , a burning chateau and a plane get rip apart ... with you in it be set-piece that really make uncharted 3 one of the more visceral and entertaining blockbuster ride of 2011 . although one could think the team just put these moment in there know people would look for they so they build excuse in the story to have they , you can not deny these be magnificent part of the game . however , for a game highly dependent on a script and precise order of event , it be very disheartening when you end up die because you do not turn a corner fast enough or miss a jump or do not know what way to go during a chase sequence . it make for a odd dichotomy since to further the `` it be like a movie '' feel of a uncharted game , one must rarely die to preserve its flow and yet without prior knowledge of what exactly need to be do , it can make for a very start\/stop kind of structure . also oddly out of place be that unlike the near flawless pacing of among thief , it be very bizarre to say some part in Drake 's Deception just flat out ... , well they kind of suck . a syrian fortress and a slow beginning as well as certain story element that be never address or properly resolve make I think the game be rewrite a couple of time and certain part get lose in the shuffle . that still do not mean the game do not have incredible high -lrb- see precede paragraph -rrb- but the low be strangely very low . also , the amount of punishment Drake take be kind of ridiculous . how can a guy go this long without crack a rib , break he finger or he leg . I mean seriously , dude 's like x-man 's Colossus . hell , even the going-on 60 Sully can keep up with the youthful Drake . but still , if there be one thing you can not knock the team for be presentation and this game be a stunner . other than one wonky wall texture , everything in the game from the mo-cap to the environment and of course the set-piece , uncharted 3 practically bleed production value . Voice act as usual be strong and character be appropriately endearing or love-to-hate-them -lrb- but why do Elena and Chloe look worse than before ? must be the eye -rrb- . the environment be also incredibly gorgeous , whether they be be destroy or not , and some I be sure be incredibly difficult to pull off despite the look of the scene . if there be one thing that uncharted 3 occasionally but not always handle be in the combat which can be strangely frustrating at time . some of they just drag for too long and even though stealth be encourage , be catch do not mean about 10 or so guy , it become a long protracted and tedious firefight as enemy spawn with sniper , grenade launcher and rpg 's lead to many out-of-the-blue death . and this be a common issue among they forum but the aim feel ... off which be quite noticeable when I actually replay among thief before I get this to re-accustom myself to Uncharted 's gameplay . this also can lead to the `` start\/stop '' structure I mention before where I can really imagine specific sequence annoying gamer on higher difficulty know what a trial they be even on normal . bring back from uncharted 2 be the online mode , the co-op and the multiplayer . in the co-op , it break down into 3 group : Arena , which play out similarly to Horde mode with the twist be that every wave will have a specific objective such as kill only count when stand in a area or `` Gold Rush '' which be straight up capture the Flag . there be co-op adventure which have you and 2 player -lrb- with strangely downgrade graphic on the character model -rrb- go through a little mini-story that be about half hour long or so . then there be the new mode , co-op Hunter which have 2 team of 2 compete to capture treasure with the villain side gain some computer AI buddy for assistance . since all money\/xp accumulate go towards you online profile , you can jump into co-op or the actual online to better you character 's unlock . and the actual multiplayer of uncharted be indeed kind of a blast . the same basic rule apply : 5 versus 5 , jump and climb anywhere you want while you attempt to capture treasure or just straight tdm , free for all , hardcore -lrb- no weapon mod or medal kickback -rrb- . some new element be introduce such as medal kickback which function but do not become acquire the same way as killstreak . choose one kickback , once a certain amount of medal be obtain , press up on the d-pad activate a certain ability such as instantly spawn a rpg in-hand , run faster for a brief time as well as many other . booster -lrb- or essentially perk -rrb- return while weapon mod be add so you can customize a gun to have faster reload , bigger clip or a `` call out '' which highlight enemy name when they be be aim at so other player can know where they be . also a new element be what be call `` power play '' so say the lose team be lose by ... a lot , a power play be bring in to hopefully give that team a chance to catch up . one thing to note be that the game do have a online pass which do NOT include a trial mode to test out the multiplayer so if you be rent the game and you want to test the online and see whether you would rather buy this then the other big online game out , you be SOL . buy it brand new or pay 10 more buck . remarkable and highly impressive with the occasional blemish , uncharted 3 be indeed a great game . the thrill be more impressive albeit familiar but unfortunately this game come after a even better one and while this game I would recommend someone play without hesitation , it be not the flawless roller-coaster ride as its predecessor .

Video_Games	POS	4	call of duty black op be the 5th cod installment for the PS3 . while it have its moment of great fun and entertainment , it just seem to be lack a little bit when compare to the Modern Warfare game . while I have hear mixed opinion of the game , from its lack in graphic compare to MW to the enjoyment of a older war -lrb- but not WWII old -rrb- , I be not sure what to expect . after play the game through on single player , I find all of the aforementioned statement to be accurate . the time frame be great . while I love the MW game , and will always enjoy a good WWII game , it be nice to be able to play a game set during lesser covered war and time period . this time open the door for different weaponry , both arms\/chemical weapon and military grade vehicle , as well as differ approach to historical event and method of interrogation . all of these area be welcome in a market that have be quickly saturate with fp military game . the game be graphically sound . sure it be not up to par with mw , but do all game really need to be ? the entertainment factor more than make up for what be very good graphic any way . character , weaponry , and environment all have great detail . the game 's biggest downfall , in my opinion , be the fact that it take place through memory during a less-than-friendly interrogation conduct by unknown person . this be exactly what ea 's battlefield 3 have do more recently . it be not the past tense time frame that bother I but rather the interrogation between each level . it be very repetitive and between catch the player off-guard in the begin to deliver a shocking ending , it become little more than a dull load-time in the middle . overall , this be a good game . if you be a single player person and do not have any cod yet , I would suggest MW 1 and\/or 2 . if you be online focus , this be probably a better choice as it be newer . either way , it be worth playing .

I have not even explore everywhere yet . and when I plan on do a mission\/quest I end up get side-track when I come across a abandon keep or bump into someone who need help . for every quest I finish I have add 3 more . and they be the typical ` fetch ' quest either . the story be immersive as be each side quest . and these side quest be not straight forward . I ` read ' a random book at the beginning of the game and only just complete it , 100 hour later . I do not have the best armor\/weapons\/spells , I do not have all the shout , and I be not even max out on level up . the graphic be incredible too . as be the gameplay , dialogue\/sound effect , lighting . of course , with any game like this -lrb- or really in general -rrb- load be a bit tedious . so while all the above-mentioned make for a incredible gaming experience , have to load so much get a tad annoying . but whatever , I be a patient guy and it be worth it . it really be unfortunate that so many people give it 1 star base upon a lagging issue -lrb- which I believe be real and I be sure one of the two patch I have have address this and other will continue to in the future -rrb- . I have only come across a couple minor glitch and for a game with such scale that be quite impressive . I 'll continue to support Bethesda as they rarely disappoint . if you can get past the ` lagging ' complaint you will find yourself with the best game of the year -lrb- yes , that be include Modern Warfare ... stupid over rate fpss -rrb- . lastly , it be rare that a game come out that be truly one player . call I a loner , but I find most gaming better alone , make a personal experience , like read a book series ... uhhh but with button instead of word . Ok , that be enough babbling . I hope you consider Skyrim if you have not already . if not , whatever , I do .
Video_Games	POS	5	I have be play computer\/video game since 1980 , a long time . in that time I have go through all the console -lrb- except the turbo grafix 16 -rrb- and play ton of computer game . halo and halo 2 be great game . in both , there be thing to dislike . the first be too short and the level repeat . in the second the field of view seem a bit too tight . this game be great , it look great and run very fluidly . the game have perhaps the most annoying end ever for a game -lrb- it make I want to burn bungie studio down -rrb- . it have much better level design , and the ability to finally get to play as a elite . I have spend thousand of hour play Halo at LAN party with my friend and be have one -lrb- my first -rrb- for Halo 2 on Dec 4th . if you be in the Lacey area , drop I a line and swing on by . the multiplayer option for live need work , badly , but the game be so much fun to play with other that I can live with they . lot of people , especially fan boy for other system be go to bash the game , but if you have a xbox and like FPS game , then give Halo 2 a whirl . see you online , right before I kill you gamertag munkeeone feel free to add I to you friend list .
Video_Games	POS	4	I get this game after purchase and become adicted to Pharoah . c iii be as fun as pharoah . however , you must be a little more careful about fire and the colapse of building in c-iii .  game be very similar to Pharoah of course , but do not matter . the graphic be good and the quality of game play be also just as good .  the scenario be not nearly as difficult as ol Pharoah , but still I enjoy this game very much .
Video_Games	POS	4	when I first start it be way easy , but I still like it . my favorite part be when we can dress she , do hair , make-up and nail . I love to watch the movie at the end that show how they look . I be 5 and I have plave this game a lot ! -lrb- type by mom -rrb-
Video_Games	POS	5	how many time I have buy these set seperately I can not say . it be many . now you get get all the infinity engine game in one shot for 20 buck . Hope it all work right technically with you os . it be the only thing I would be wary of . the game be legendary and need no review , Biowares entire reputation be root in its achievement with the infinity engine and Baldur 's gate 2 : shadow of Amn specifically . they have go on to build some pretty powerful franchise but Baldur 's gate 2 have no equal -lrb- or successor -rrb- in gaming . it be the Mona Lisa , of PCRPG 's and that that . unlike the NWN set , this set be `` complete '' but you still will have to mod the game to get the most out of they . I would never play these straight out of the box anymore . perhaps Bioware get too much credit and the modding community deserve a little bit more , for the spit and polish at least .
Video_Games	POS	5	ok , we all know how ! awesome ! this system be ! its a mp3 player , mini movie player , game system , photo holder , its all anybody could ever want ! its look be sleek , smooth , and H.O.T. !!! the screen be better than anything , its get about 16.77 million color , the display be amazing . sure , its a `` handheld '' device , but really , its much , much more ! it be truly a all in one entertainment system that can fit in the palm of you hand . oh yea ! i forget , it can also surf the internet ! but here be the one problem , it be way expensive . i buy the system core , a memmory card -lrb- recomended 2gb -rrb- the playgear protect pocket -lrb- a must have to keep you psp safe -rrb- a car charger -lrb- for raod trip -rrb- a battery charger , one game -lrb- socom -rrb- , the Wifi connector -lrb- to use the internet , not a must have , but awesome if you have one -rrb- and it come to the amount of about $ 350 dollaar , that be ALOT ! but really , in the end , it be worth it .
Video_Games	NEG	1	not really a lot to say here . the graphic be actually spectacular . that be why it get the one star . the game itself be utter nonsense and absolute crap . I have see people get through it in as little as a bit over a hour , I take my time and get 3 out of it . nothing really here at all to offer to anyone who be a fan of drive game , unless you like the walmart arcade racer in the arcade area . then this would be right up you alley . the physics , as with all NFS game since ... the first few original , be absolutely ridiculous . the car themselves be gorgeous , but behave nothing like car . ea gamble it be entire game on be the only one to offer Porsches , due to a contract game like Forza 4 , be not allow to use Porsches . well , this strategy be a absolute , utter failure . it will never compete with game like Forza 3 or 4 , or Gran Turismo . I can not imagine it be really mean to though , it feel like they spend all of about 5 minute develop it . I suppose I be a bit harsh . I just like my drive game to feel like I be actually drive something . honestly , any drive game without a interior view automatically lose all star . this game have no real story , no real substance to it , but like I say , graphically it be honestly pretty awesome . as for judge if you should buy it or not , go to you local walmart , play one of those `` fast and the furious '' arcade game . if you like it , this be for you . if you be look for anything resemble actual driving , do not bother , honestly . at least not at the price it be be sell for now . when it drop to the 5 dollar value box , or if you be go to rent it , go for it . mercifully , I be smart enough to play before buying . do the world a favor and do not give ea or black Box any of you money . let evolution take it be course .
Video_Games	POS	5	I have play all of the Nancy Drew game , and to I , treasure in a Royal Tower be by far , the best one . in this game , Nancy Drew , 18 year old super-slueth , visit Wickford Castle and Ski Resort for a winter vacation . but when a terrible blizzard keep she and 4 other guest strand there , a mystery turn up . someone have ransack the library , and one guest claim a item of value of hers have be steal . I would not reccomend this game for people who have not play other Nancy Drew game , because the castle be very confusing -lrb- I get lose a bunch of time ! -rrb- , but all in all , this game rock !
Video_Games	NEG	1	this game have mad system requirement . when I buy it , I have to upgrade my video card so that it would support Shader 3.0 -lrb- the game doesnt look that fine trust I , it would have run on 2.0 perfectly , developer be just alienate 2.0 user -rrb- . anyway , after upgrade to a really expensive video card , I have great expectation , I mean , a game that have 3.0 shader as a minimum system requirement have to look awesome right ? well no , it look exactly like any other game I ever play on my 2.0 Shader card . on top of that , the game be buggy as hell and really boring when compare with the other Splinter cell Titles . my final recommendation ? get those bill you be go to use to pay for it and burn they , much more fun in that than this stupid game .
Video_Games	POS	4	I have all my electronics hide in a closet . in the summer the heat from the electronics make the closet maybe 20 deg hotter than ambient . I have hear about issue with PS3 's overheating , so i think a fan be a good idea . this unit plug in easily . the fan turn on when you have the PS3 on , and off when PS3 in standby mode . the fan be a little loud ; even more than this they seem to pull the internal fan out of balance . when the PS3 first start up with these fan go , you hear a harmonic vibration from the internal fan . this go away after maybe 45 seconds , then it be just a little louder than normal . when I do not turn on the accy fan , the harmonic vibration do not happen . I feel the extra air movement be enough to increase the lifespan of my PS3 . I be happy with the purchase .
Video_Games	POS	5	we buy the Wii package for we adult daughter as a Christmas gift . she be thrill and have already wear out two battery . the package arrive in good time and in good condition .

AlarmClock	POS	5	I have look everywhere -lrb- include Wal-Mart -rrb- and could not find just a simple travel clock anywhere . this be just what I want - nothing fancy but it do the job I need it to do .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	cute clock and cute idea but the vibration be not as strong as I have imagine .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my wife have cataract , but with the large letter she can see the time from all across the room , and so far it have keep time perfectly
AlarmClock	POS	5	so my grandparent have be waken up at like 10 yo so I buy this for they and know they wake up at 9:59 and 59 seconds ok so that be my history report even though I only get u z ------ ok that be my review
AlarmClock	POS	5	the clock be purchase for my grandson who be autistic and love clock . the purchase be timely and in good shape as advertise . thanks .
AlarmClock	POS	5	after purchase a ugly Sonic bomb alarm for myself and have great result -lrb- finally ! -rrb- get up for work on time , my 16-year-old daughter-also a very heavy sleeper-requested one . further search turn up the same alarm in way better clothing . now we both be jolt from sound sleep , out of bed , and be leave the house on time . if you want to get to class on time or keep you job , I highly recommend both of these alarm . they do not have multiple you-tube video for nothing !
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the concept be great , the build in lamp be terrible - about as bright as a night light , do not know how that be suppose to wake I up . also , if it go out it be not cheap to replace . to get any use out of the Sunrise\/Set feature you have to have it control a external lamp with a external power adapter almost the size of the clock itself . the clock itself feel like a toy , light plastic and cheap construction with flimsy button that work for a few month and require small finger -lrb- I have those and still have to use my nail -rrb- . I would recommend that you spend the money on a clock of this type with a build in external lamp control , most of those even come with sleep sound . can not beat that . but really , really , do not buy this alarm clock . perhaps  Sunrise Sun Simulator Day Light SRS150 Alarm clock  or even  Apollo Health DayBreak Duo Dawn\/Dusk Simulator
AlarmClock	NEG	1	do not expect this to last more than 1 year . the digital display be so bright that it hurt to look at it if you wake up and want to see the time . but the bottom line , it do not work after about 9 month . I only give it 1 star because I have to .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this little clock only measure 2 '' x 2 '' but it be simplicity make up for the tiny size . the off\/off button be simple to operate -lrb- up for `` on , '' and down for `` off '' -rrb- , the time and alarm be easy to set , and the clock make no noticeable tick sound . the alarm be reasonably loud . I would have like something larger and a bit more robust -lrb- I fumble in the morning -rrb- and be amaze at how difficult it be to find a simple battery operate alarm clock that do nothing but keep the time and wake you up .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have use this clock for a few month now . its great . its the little thing like the ease of set the nap timer or use the snooze . some guy say this clock gain time . that a little true after 5 month it gain 3 minute . not a problem .
AlarmClock	POS	5	the Westclox Travelmate be multi-useful . use when travel , at work , or at home . the ideal `` backup '' when weather-related problem develop . keep one in you car -lrb- and boat , etc -rrb- . if you be downsize or just want thing small but effective , this be the clock for you . Easy to use button , clear dial and amazing battery life . my original one be over 10 year old and never have battery replace . it be actually kinda weird ... in a good way . these will be some stock stuffer this year .
AlarmClock	POS	4	these be nice and funky . we buy one use from somebody who put athletic tape over the speaker -lrb- on the back -rrb- to muffle the bird noise -- a good idea , it be plenty loud enough on `` low '' and with the tape . if you be a deep sleeper , I be sure the unmuffled `` high '' setting will open you eye .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love the look of this clock and it keep perfect time . it sit on my computer desk and I can see that big ol light up dial from across the room . I have never use the alarm function so I can not comment on that ...
AlarmClock	POS	4	the display could be a little brighter and more prominent , but even so , it be fine . other than that , it be a all around great alarm clock . the sound be pretty good too .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I be really bum that this one do not work out . I be look for a white noise machine and I only use the `` rain '' and `` white noise '' sound and they loop be WAY too short . I be a bit neurotic and obsessive about little thing and be sensitive to pattern . the `` rain '' setting be about a 10 second loop and I could pick out a faint ` tap tap tap ' and I , of course , focus on that , every 10 seconds . then I go to the `` white noise '' set which have a even fainter problem noise , on a even shorter loop , about 5 seconds . I also feel that even the lowest noise setting be not quite low enough -lrb- I have the clock close to by head -rrb- . and the light emit by the clock be really bright , even when turn on low . maybe this will be better in my son 's room ...
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock replace we last alarm which fall victim to a overly angry press of the snooze button . my wife have be use it for a week now with no complaint . the initial setup be incredibly easy . after hold setup , you use the dial to input you setting . a fast turn of the dial increase the time in 10 or 30 minute increment ; a slow one nudge the minute along . I never realize how handy it be to have a 7-day alarm schedule - especially where I like to sleep in on weekend and have to be up early on monday . it be worth note , however , that if on a certain Wednesday you take a day off -lrb- and change the wake-up time -rrb- you would have a entire week to forget that you would do so . finally , it would useful if the manufacturer would better secure the holder for the -lrb- backup -rrb- battery . still , I be as enthusiastic as one could be about a alarm clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	so far everything be as describe in the product description . will come back and write more if anything turn out negative .
AlarmClock	POS	5	it arrive quickly and be just what I want . I be very happy with my purchase .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this clock because I want a `` set-and-forget '' clock that also have a thermometer . my major complaint about this clock be that in the two week that I have own it , it be never be able to sync with the atomic clock ! it keep try every night and never succeed . since return it be not worth the hassle , I decide to open it up and look inside . -lrb- I be a engineer , with some knowledge of how these circuit work -rrb- I be surprise to find that the the circuit inside look extremely cheap . there be a dry solder where the battery wire connect to the circuit board . the antenna -lrb- for the radio -rrb- have its wire short . everything look very sloppy in general . I then manage to separate the short on the antenna , hope that it would make the radio work . no luck . the radio sync still do not work . which be hardly surprising consider that the antenna itself be not cleanly wind ! it be unevenly wound by hand ! not machine wound . do I mention that the build quality be horrible ? I do not know if the clock 's circuitry have support for manage daylight savings or I have to reset it twice a year . I 'll find out in about 4 month I guess . but for the price , I guess it be a decent enough clock . it serve my purpose : maintain time fairly accurately and have a thermometer . I would really like to have the clock sync with the atomic clock via the radio though . Edit -lrb- 17-jan-2010 -rrb- : okay , so the radio feature finally work out , but it be still kind of flaky , work sometimes , do not sometimes . I be willing to now give this product the benefit of the doubt : maybe it be my location or something about the construction of my apartment that be the problem . I have revise the rating to 4 star now . would give it five star if only I have not open up the clock and see the shoddy construction .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I think this be a fantastic alarm clock . although it could have be the gental alarm could be a tad louder . the number be large enough to see . otherwise there be nothing wrong with it .  i like the tradtional alarm clock styal . I be more impressed with the quality of this clock better then it be t112 counter part . I would love to see more of these make then the other one witch I could do without .  i like havee three option of bell & not two . this electronic be pretty to look at also .
AlarmClock	POS	5	initially i be hesitant to purchase this clock , becuase the review be so negative . but i go out on a limb and buy it anyway . the clock be EXACTLY what i want . I be a college student and the escalate alarm work perfectly so it be quiet enough to wake I up -lrb- I be a light sleeper -rrb- but not to loud to wake my roommate up . I absolutely love that it be analog , i much prefer it to digital . and i know some people where say it be smaller than they expect and i can say that be true , but it be still a lovely and function clock , not super large or anything . the only thing for I be that the picture of the clock be only different in one way really , the font . the font on the clock in the picture be different from the font on the actual clock -lrb- the number be write in a more normal text -rrb- . someone also say it be very wobbly , but that be not true it be very stable for I . I mean as long as you be not slam you entire arm on the thing to turn the alarm off , you should be fine . and it be a very soft tick clock , so its perfect for a light sleeper such as myself . actually the light ticking be kind of soothing ...
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock be so cheap and very useful and reliable . the back light be really helpful at night . the thermometer come it handy to temperature control .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	it would be one thing if the button be big enough for even petite finger or if the light be really very bright to notice or even if the clock keep proper time - but it do not ! I receive this item as a gift and be shock the sticker price . I have have the clock a few year now and have be itch to get rid of it . I have to continually reset the time - every 6 week I find it be get ten minute faster so I either set my alarm ahead or range back through the number to set the time correctly or to correct it the next month again . the radio be cheap and difficult to tune . I need a sunrise clock but at this point I be think of get a `` vacation '' timer for my bedside lamp and just set that instead . what a bother .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I really enjoy use this product , and it be a great addition to my Star Wars collection . I do wish it have more feature -lrb- date , timer , etc. -rrb- , but if you be a Star Wars fanatic like I , that should not be a problem . I really be please with this purchase , and seriously recommend it ! I do hope they come out with more product just like this one .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be really glad I order this clock . the light flash several minute before the alarm go off . I usually wake up to that . there be many different option on the alarm . it be face be always light up so you can see the time if you awake during the night , but not too bright to light up the room . I be very picky with clock and I absolutley love this clock .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I be happy that this product be just as I think it would look and the size I want , but it gain 2 hour of time overnight . the return process so far have be very easy and efficient . this process be not complete as I just discover the problem and initiate the return . this be a Christmas gift .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this thing . I keep it set on hourly chirping . I spend half the year in Seattle with only crow and seagull . this clock remind I so much of home in the Carolinas with the chirping of various bird and it be fun to guess . I put it on the deck with the raptor card hope to scare away unwanted critter . . that have only frightened the cat , however .
AlarmClock	POS	5	simple and to the point ALARM CLOCK . after return a too complicated alarm clock `` gadget '' from Oregon Scientific , this clock be what I be look for . it work like a charm this morning -lrb- 3\/11\/07 -rrb- change to DST . get it , plug it in and forget it ! and for a unbeatable price to boot ! Wish it have the weekday\/weekend alarm option , but still a great ALARM clock .
AlarmClock	POS	4	as other reviewer have mention , this seem to be the only clock of its kind out there . it be the most sensible clock I have ever own . I have it set for a earlier time twice a week on the day that I run , and for a later time on weekend day . I do not hear a pop when the radio come on , so it be so slight I do not even notice it . the shortcoming be slight but I will mention they . to set the alarm you use the big knob on the top , and it make a fairly loud crank noise which can be kind of annoy to you sleep spouse . the other thing be that the little display that tell you if the alarm be on or not be very tiny - it would be nice if it be bigger . overall though this be a great alarm clock and I recommend it for anyone who do not get up at the same time every day .
AlarmClock	POS	4	there be few analog plug-in clock available these day , so I be delighted to find this one . not only do it function well , but I love the design . the pre-alarm tone light flash be cool , though it rarely wake I if I be in deep sleep .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	the Sharper image sound Soother have a very sleek and modern design , however , there be a few flaw that detract from the overall experience . first , the digital display be very bright in a dark bedroom . unlike a regular , cheap alarm clock where only the time be light , the entire display of the sound soother be backlit . if you bedroom have little ambient light at night , this display will emit a glow that some people may find too bright . although there be three display brightness setting , there be little difference between they and the lowest setting be still bright . we have to turn the clock away from the bed at night so it be not directly in we face , but the glow be still significant . second , the sound quality could be better . this could be a tradeoff for the sleek design , but the sound be not very natural come out of the small rear speaker and be a bit tinny as another reviewer have note . the volume control be not very good either , as the difference between the first , second , third , etc. volume selection be very noticeable . in other word , 1 be too soft for some sound , but 2 be way too loud . the audio loop on some of the sound be too short as well , and if you be concentrate on the sound you may be able to detect the pattern , which can be distract as you be try to fall asleep . also , the control button themselves make a very loud and abrasive `` click '' sound when you push they , which seem odd for a machine design to relax you . overall , the Sound Soother be a decent alarm clock that get the job do , but it could definitely be improve -lrb- display too bright , audio quality be lack , and button take away from the overall experience -rrb- . although it be make by Sharper image , it have a somewhat `` cheap '' feeling to it . despite the flaw , it be one of the better sound machine\/alarm clock I come across that be less than $ 50 .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my 17 year old daughter be invite to attend she last two year of high school away from home . she be incredibly smart and we just could not pass up the opportunity for she . the only problem be , be away from home and have nobody to make she get up , she be constantly oversleep ! we shop for all sort of alarm clock for she , always buy the one that be advertise as be the loudest . after she second detention for miss class and\/or be tardy I decide I have to find something that actually would wake she up . well , I find it . she have now have this alarm clock for a little over a month and have not oversleep once !! she say the first couple of day it scare she half to death , but this be not one of those alarm that just buzz and she never hear . she put the part that vibrate under she pillow because put it under the mattress be not a option with the way the dorm bed be construct . I highly recommend this product to anyone who have a child like mine who do not hear traditional alarm clock !! one less worry for I as a mother have a child live away from home .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	useless . the off switch do not work , so clock would go off every 12 hour with no way to shut it up . throw it away after fuss with it for three day .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I like the : 1 -rrb- Easy to read display 2 -rrb- Alarm Reset - single button turn off alarm and reset it for next day and it be easy to find 3 -rrb- Easy to use 4 -rrb- display PM & Alarm on 5 -rrb- single buttom to list to NOAA Weather 6 -rrb- look good , but if you be up very close have a bit of a paint on finish appearence - the finish could be better . 7 -rrb- single alarm - most radio alarm clock have two alarm , but as I never use that feature and it cause confusion on what I be set more than once , I very much like that there be only one alarm . 8 -rrb- pick up AM , FM , and Weather great - I be in a city . 9 -rrb- Great Price - I prefer this radio to my almost new ... radio that it be replace !
AlarmClock	NEG	2	where to start . no warranty , no instruction . would not set time automatically . focus knob simply rotate ; do not focus . without instruction be difficult to set up . Worth maybe $ 10 for the projection , no more . overall , cheap , cheap , cheap . Poor example for Lacrosse ; will avoid they from now on . very disappointed ,
AlarmClock	POS	4	this be a great little alarm clock . we be no longer at the mercy of the unreliable hotel wake-up call . however , the face of the clock be dark and therefore illegible in the middle of the night .
AlarmClock	POS	5	i be a heavy sleeper and work 2 job so every alarm clock i have buy i couldnt hear ... they either chirp or the alarm be very soft and i couldnt hear they to wake for work . so i be always try not to sleep to heavily when i do get to sleep which eventually start make I pretty miserable from lack of sleep ... until i find this alarm clock the sonic boom now i can fall asleep and this clock wake I right up its loud and the vibrate help alot as well . very good product !!!!! very good investment !!!!!
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this because I want a small , maintenance-free alarm clock . it be not as small as I would like -lrb- it be about the size of two VHS tape -rrb- . it claim to be solar power but it come with a cr123a lithium `` back-up '' battery . the manual read , `` this battery should provide a back up power supply to you clock for up to 8 year or even longer . '' I have not have it long so I can not verify that claim . it do set the time automatically , which be cool .
AlarmClock	POS	4	other review be correct as to the instruction leave something to be desire . I spend 45 minute try to figure out how to set the alarm . in the end , just keep try and you will stumble across the correct combo of button to press and when . I enjoy be awaken by chime vs my old alarm clock with a nasty loud buzzer that would make you jump five foot in the air when it go off . other reviewer where correct in say the alarm sound i.e. chime , rainfall etc. be even to loud in the lowest setting . I be go to experiment slightly cover the speaker with duct tape till I get it to the lower volume I want . this clock be not perfect , but the next best -lcb- for chime -rcb- be twice as expensive as this one . otherwise there be no other clock that come close to this one and trust I , I spend countless hour search the internet for just the right clock . this be as close as you be go to get with a clock that offer many different sound to wake to , have two separate alarm . one for you & one for you wife . the clock have a nice look to it . to those who complain about the sound quality etc. . you get what you pay for , go spend hundred of dollar and get a ipod with a separate sound system .
AlarmClock	POS	4	too bad there be no option to keep it on !!! the time only display for a few seconds after you clap\/make noise and then it be off . you might be applaud a lot if you be often interested in the time . otherwise , I love the way it look and its size be perfect for my desk space .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the clock flash a frightening red color when it go off in the morning-first surprise . then the battery die , so I replace they , but after two day the backlight stop work , the number fade to the point where I could barely see they , and the volume become so low I could barely hear it .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I do not understand all the rave review about this useless alarm clock . Mine , when set up , buzz for less than a minute , in such a low tone that you can happily sleep through the entire time and wake up two hour later without even notice . additionally , it would be suppose , when you do not hear the alarm the first time , to buzz again at 4 minute interval : it do not . in simpler word : it only sound for less than a minute at the set time , it have a very low tone , and stop dead there , until the day after . no appeal , no redemption . you be go to be late for work if you rely on this awful clock . it be a waste of time , money and hope . I purchase it because it bear the name of `` Elgin '' , a very good watchmaker . but I go back to my `` make in China '' $ 6 alarm clock , that be reliable , humble and do not require fuss about .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	pay 20.99 for the clock . it work as promise first six month . BUT it stop work in 6 month , go dark and nothing can be do to turn the light back on . it seem like if I return it I have to pay for ship both way . not sure why if the product be defective i have to pay for shipping .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I like a travel alarm you can see in the dark , and the Snooze button accomplish this when you wake up in the middle of the night , yet turn off to let you sleep in the dark . it be a nice small size and compact to carry .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this alarm clock be the perfect backup travel alarm clock . it be the smallest , lightest alarm clock possible that even have a few extra feature to boot . \* it be small 2.6 '' W x 1.8 '' h x 0.6 '' d and weigh a scant 2oz with battery . \* it take 2 lr44 watch battery -lrb- easy to find -rrb- that have a lifespan of over 1.5 year and be lighter than the newer version -lrb- Casio PQ-13 and Casio PQ-15 -rrb- that take aaa and aa battery . \* Extra feature on this tiny clock be : 1 -rrb- 12 & 24 hr setting 2 -rrb- snooze feature -lrb- only 5-mins though -rrb- 3 -rrb- lead backlight -lrb- old green type -rrb- 4 -rrb- 3 separate function button that adjust with a audible click : time -lrb- alarm\/clock\/display -rrb- , display -lrb- 12 or 24 hour -rrb- , and alarm -lrb- on\/off\/snooze -rrb- so that there be not any mistake . as a result of its compact size , the function button be tiny . however , after a few use one can easily remember which button be which . in addition , as this be digital , there be no annoying tick . my main complaint be that the snooze\/light button -lrb- the blue one be the picture -rrb- be not protect when the stand\/cover be close . as such , the button could get accidentally press during transport . however , this issue have not be address in subsequent version . highly recommend as a backup travel alarm for those of we with smart phone . if the small label and tiny button be not a issue , this would also work well as a primary alarm clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	live in the country , we lose power a lot , so ac-powered alarm clock simply be not a option for I . I have use a Variety of 100 % battery operate alarm clock in the past , and this might be my favorite so far . its simple : a analog clock face that light up nicely -lrb- but not too brightly -rrb- when the button on the top be press . the alarm be easy to set , easy to turn on and off , and hard to sleep through . the tone be almost pleasant -lrb- at first -rrb- wake you up without a shock ... but it get steadily louder and faster so it be almost impossible to sleep through . I have not use it long enough to rate battery life , but power by 1 c battery it should last for a quite a while -lrb- my old clock run on two AAA 's and last almost a year - let 's face it , alarm clock be not exactly demand -rrb- . my only concern be that the unit be plastic . my cat like to hockey-puck thing off of my bedside table -lrb- especially if he want he breakfast , i.e. , almost every morning -rrb- . that be why my old clock be a metal clock -- the kind with the real bell inside . however , it be survive be knock to the ground several time so far with no visible damage , so despite a somewhat flimsy feel this clock be pretty sturdy .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	like some of the other reviewer , I too notice a very short sound loop . on most of the option it be annoying and not relaxing . but a few of the sound like the surf one , you can not notice it as much . also , there be complaint about the brightness of the lcd . I do not find that too bad . it be like have a soft blue nightlight . all in all , it be pretty good . the two alarm option be nice , the sound of a few of the track be decent , and it totally mask all the noise around I . so , I would recommend it if you can fine one sound track that be to you liking .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this clock be compact and easy to read and use . I wish that the on-off switch be more readable in the dark .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I be glad I find this little clock on Amazon , because it seem to be exactly what I be look for . Elgin be a reputable name in timepiece . unfortunately , the clock gain about 15 minute every five hour ! I test it more than once . I be so disappointed . have to return it . still look for something like it . I need something simple , folding , battery-operated , a clock that can keep accurate time -lrb- ! -rrb- and with a light that come on when press . unfortunately , it be not to be with this one . I do not usually write review , but feel obligate to report my recent experience with this model .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I really like this clock because it be easy to use , it do the job for which I buy it , and I like the sound of the alarm .
AlarmClock	POS	5	a good sturdy reliable travel clock for little money . Easy operation and compact . alarm be loud enough to wake you . I use it every day besides travel .
AlarmClock	POS	4	visually , this dalek alarm clock look very much like a real Dalek . the sound effect be excellant , and make I giggle every time ! my only real complaint be that the time display be so small it be virtually useless , unless you happen to be within 6 '' of the thing - which be well within lethal range of a dalek -lrb- even one that be 7 '' tall -rrb- ! the projection clock work well , but would be more useful if it stay on continuously . this product would be better if it have the option of plug-in power , which would allow for a continuous wall\/ceiling display by the projector . the battery only nature of it give it a toy-like feel , rather than that of a real , usefully functional alarm clock . of course , the point of the thing be really just to look cool and get some grin - which it most defintely do . I can not seem to walk by it without push the button to hear it say `` exterminate !!! '' Chuckle every time .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I think its a good travel clock and certainly easy to set , etc. . however , it be impossible to read the time in the dark and that would be the only improvement need to give it 5 star . so far , I have take it on two trip and it perform just fine .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a fairly low end clock . the clock display be dim and will only work after insert three aa battery , the attach power cord be only for the projection portion . once the battery be install , the display on the clock be on the dim end of the spectrum . the projection be great and it be good to have focus and rotation control . for the projection portion I give this clock \*\*\*\*\* , but for the overall clock , it only get \*\*\*
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock be quite functional , the only issue be that the light be too bright in the dark , make the number blur .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	take way too long to eve start delivery . it be 4 day & I a still recieve the same lame message `` shipping soon '' . stop talk and do it !!! if you want you item do not shop at amazon !
AlarmClock	POS	5	I buy one of these for household use and like it enough to buy another one . -lrb- my strategy be to have several inexpensive alarm clock scatter throughout my apartment so that by the time I have find they all , I be awake . -rrb- the folding design allow the device to be pretty light without be easy to tip over . instead of buy yet another one , I be go to try out the  nap mate  the button on the Travel-Mate be make from harder plastic and be probably more durable . we shall see : -rrb-
AlarmClock	POS	5	we need a weather radio because we live in tornado country . when it get stormy , the 9 volt battery backup on this NOAA weather radio keep the weather report come in . we live near a city and have no trouble receive the NOAA broadcast . this unit cost as much as any of the standard weather radio I be look at , but it also have radio , alarm and a very large digital clock display . the spec say the display be 1 '' but I think it be closer to 2 '' . it be not a designer piece , it be purely functional , but that be what we buy it for . a cool feature be that you can set you alarm clock to wake you to the weather report . if you be travel , that be pretty handy .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock do exactly what it be advertise to do . it be small , it be cute , it work on a aa battery and the alarm be loud enough to wake up a normal person . I like the finish and the retro look . what I especially like be that be have a little button you push to see the face light up in the middle of the night ... without have it light up all the time . it be a awesome clock for $ 10 . I receive exactly the clock that be represent .
AlarmClock	POS	5	we love this clock . I buy it for my 8 year old daughter who can sleep through anything . anything , that be , except this clock . you can hear the alarm all over the house . I be glad I finally find something that will wake she up .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	what good be a clock radio that do not keep time . this piece of junk be recieve on Friday and send back on Monday . during the weekend , I set the time three time and within 5 to 6 hour the clock revert to the initial setting , and the radio preset be also lose .
AlarmClock	POS	5	the clock be very cute . the snooze button be in a great place , and the increase volume of the alarm be something helpful to most people . good buy , quick service .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	it be the biggest size of LED you can find -lrb- 2.5 '' -rrb- . it be also very bright that you can read it well even with bright sun in the room . my only complain be there be a poor contact between the clock and the base that house the battery compartment . the clock go blank after I fold it down and reopen it again . I have to slap it to get the LED 's to light up again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	it be great for my husband . he love it and show it off to other in company . everybody say it be cute .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I buy the attachment and it trigger my other brighter lamp which work like a charm . the clock 's light , so-called brighter , be a joke . that original clock bulb sometimes come on , and 99 % of the time , do not come on at all . the control to just turn on the light in a dark room mean to touch the second to the bottom right seed size button and hold it till it brighten up . so that be annoying . there be not many choice out there and from what I have see its adequate for I with the attachment . without it , this so call new brighter bulb would not do a thing for I . and I have it right next to my bed . so unless you be face it , how will you know its on ? the term `` bright '' be relative . for I it be - at its brightest - as bright as a candle .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be just what we need for we bedroom . it be very easy to read from across the room at night .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the Soleil Sunrise Alarm clock do what be advertise it help wake you up easier and more alert that a standard alarm clock . the radio do work , but only on strong station . I also quickly remove the translucent housing over the bulb , do that allow the lamp do its job . the clock work best in pitch black where the lamp will light up the whole room . be the alarm worth it , if you need to wake up early in the morning , and then yes . could it be better , yes a clear lamp housing , and a better radio would be great addition .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	the price be good . however , the back light be very dim . the time be difficult to read in the dark . I purchase for use as a bedside clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	do I receive a update version since the previous comment . . hmm . I must have . First of all , I love this product and here 's why : -lrb- I be listen to Rainforest as I write this , and I be in heaven -rrb- there be a volume range you can adjust for the sound from from 1 - 8 range . I only need to set mine at 2 for a audible , yet gentle and clear sound in my bedroom . this machine can be use in a small room to a large , spacious room with the range capability . you can adjust the backlight brightness on the display to 3 setting : hus , Med , or Lo there be also a Daylight Savings Time button on the back that can be activate . the 20 different sound to choose from be generous compare to other nature sound product . the sound be clear with combined layer of soft background to up front stronger sound - very accurate and realistic you can set a timer for sound if you choose and the sound will automatically stop at the end of the time . two separate alarm setting -lrb- can choose a sound or a beep alarm -rrb- the price be very , very affordable ! product be lightweight and sturdy , compact to fit gracefully on a small bedstand , sleek and well balanced . to parent with newborn : there be a heartbeat sound ! what more can I say ... sharper image produce another quality product . I previously have a expensive wooden chime alarm clock , and when the chime begin to sound like a low clunk after two year , it become almost worthless , except for the digital clock image , so live and learn ! I be jubliant and satisfied that I find a even better product with so many feature and sound option ...
AlarmClock	POS	5	very nice clock . it be attractive , the display contain the information I want , the numeral be large , it be light & small enough for travel . be solar power be a big plus as no more battery to buy . that the temperature read a couple of degree too warm be minor . set up be straight forward . a lighter background would allow view at a greater distance . I do not use the alarm so can not comment on that and the atomic part be not relevant for I . solid 5 star .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I have have it for a month and use it daily as a alarm clock and occasionally for a nap timer . keep perfect time as far as I can tell . thing I wish it have : 1 . graduate alarm volume ... start off low , then grow louder if not snooze or shut off . 2 . larger\/smoother alarm turn off switch . 3 . no beep sound when you hit the snooze button to see what time it be at night . 4 . ability to operate snooze button when unit be close .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this little alarm clock so much , I have several throughout my house . pro : \* 24 hour time -lrb- a huge plus for people who have to work shift -rrb- \* nap timer -lrb- I use this feature all the time to wait 15 minute to see if I have correctly treat a hypoglycemic episode -rrb- . you can nap up to 4 hour . \* small and portable con : \* can only set the date and time forward ; you have to scroll through the entire cycle if you have overshoot you value . \* can not turn the back light off -lrb- but it only stay on for about 4 seconds -rrb- \* can not turn the nap timer off \* can not see how much time you have leave on you nap
AlarmClock	POS	5	love this travel alarm with nap feature . I have be purchase this feature 3 time since 1996 . I use it for nap of course , as well as a timer for kid program , do housework , and even bake . it be my main alarm clock in the house and camper .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love that I do not have to set my alarm every night anymore . I be sure my husband agree as the alarm clock I have purchase to replace my alarm clock that die make irritating beep to indicate success at change any setting . I tend to keep thing for a long time -lrb- have the alarm clock that die for over 20 year -rrb- , so I be very happy to find something I be sure I can live with hopefully for another 20 . I do have to switch from wake to the radio to use the beep alarm because I be ignore the radio - but that be just a personal problem . so far , this be a great alarm .
AlarmClock	POS	5	a excellent alarm clock . Easy to set up and very reliable . good volume control . the only downside be that it do not receive the radio signal very well .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the idea of this alarm clock be very appealing : a alarm clock that can be easily individualize for the day of the week . here , however , be the reality in two bullet point : 1 . the tuner be awful . within ten minute of have locate a staion the focus have slip and you have to relocate it or listen to gradually worsten static . 2 . the alarm clock component be about 95 % accurate . think on that ... 5 % of the time you will not be awaken . my partner and I have have it for a year and for the longest time think that one of we have do something wrong in set it . or we be sure that we have do it right but wake up late have not make we tardy for anything . this morning be the last straw , though . 5 % , when you be depend on this little monster be not good enough . and now , off to shop Amazon for a new clock radio .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I purchase this clock for my 95 old year mother . she like it be ease of use and it be durability . also , it be a attractive clock . my mom be very happy with it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I really can not say how this be because I buy it as a gift for my grand-daughter for Christmas ... . she love Legos and Star Wars ... so if it be she writting -lrb- she be 8 yr . old -rrb- I guess she would say she love it ...
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this thing only work twice for I . today it sit on my computer desk display the time only . if you need to make someone late for work , here ya go : -lrb-
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this little clock . it be small and slender -lrb- like a a compact powder -rrb- and have super easy function . will not travel without it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	the alarm clock be small enough and lightweight to carry throughout you trip , and be reliable for the day you need to wake up to catch a plane or bus ride . the clock fold to a compact size that prevent the user from accidentally click the button . when the clock be unfold , the case serve as a stand . the blue glow of the screen be easy on the eye , especially when you eye be accustom to the darkness . use 1 aaa battery , which I do not need to change in 7.5 month . the alarm be loud enough to wake I from sleep without scare I . only quirk about the clock be the snooze function , which allow I to sleep only a extra 4 minute before the alarm go off again .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the display be difficult to read in Daytime -lrb- black on gray -rrb- unless you press on Vader 's head for a 5 sec backlight . if the display be like any normal digital clock with blue\/red number , it would be 5 star as the body detail be great .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I do by the adapter to plug it in a a few extra bird card . I really enjoy wake up to the sound of bird every morning . it bring a little sunshine to cold Wisconsin winter . over all it be a good product and I be glad I buy it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this little clock be great . it glow at night and you can set the amount of glow . Easy to read and set . great value for the money . would order again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	Retraction from 1\/11\/2011 . I write a sassy report about return on a malfunction clock I purchase . after simply navigate `` my Amazon Account '' , I learn how simple it really be to return a item . I regret be quick to comment . I be a first time buyer .
AlarmClock	POS	5	everything about this alarm clock be great . the nap timer be good when you need to time anything . look good on a desk .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my husband be a huge sw fan who receive this for he birthday . he be thrilled ! great look toy , with the bonus of be a clock\/mp3 player\/etc . good stuff !
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I get this product with the optional module which turn on another lamp . that really help make the overall `` dawn '' usably bright , but the optional module stop work after about a year . the idea of wake to a light like sunrise work really well for I , but this product be cheaply make and another brand would likely be a better choice . the radio be very poor , I have to take it apart and pull the coil internal antenna wire out and drape it up the wall to get any reception - and I live in a major metro area with many strong station ! the scratchy reception may be more effective at annoy I awake than the light . the product could be really good with a infusion of better quality .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the design of the display be great , I like how you can go both back and forth through the sound , without have to cycle through they all , and it come with a lot of sound -lrb- though some I can not see anyone want to sleep to -rrb- . the date and time be easy to set . I do not use the alarm function , as I prefer to use my cell phone alarm , so I can not speak to the functionality of that . some other review have make comment about the shortness of the track before repeat , but it be not something I notice too much . I end up return it after two day . the biggest problem for I be this low hum that emanate from it through any sound , and I find it really distract , because I be listen to the buzz hum more than the sound -lrb- ebb Tide -rrb- . I look up some review , and find other people with the same issue , which apparently turn out to be a cheap power supply cause the speaker to vibrate inappropriately -lrb- or something , I do not exactly understand the concept -rrb- . Learning that , I realize it be a design flaw , and not my unit , so I drop the idea of just exchange it . the other problem I have with it , though by itself it be not enough to make I want to return it , be the lack of real volume control . you have loud , louder , loudest , blow you ear drum , and 11 . the lowest setting -lrb- 1 -rrb- be barely tolerable for I on most sound , and utterly unacceptable on other . have I decide to keep it , I would have relocate it to the other end of the room . I end up replace it with  sound Oasis S-650-01 Sleep Sound therapy System  I only just get it today , so I have no review of it yet , but I can tell you there be no annoying audio buzz . also , some store will price match with Amazon if you print out the page , so I actually get it for less than the Amazon price .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be the perfect size clock for travel . it be small and easily fit in you cosmetic bag . it have a alarm that be not obtrusive . I like a analog clock much better than a digital - much easier to set !!
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I purchase this clock when it be power by a c battery and would have rate it five Stars . unfortunately when I re-order it recently , it have be redesign . it be now power by 3 aa battery which do not fit into its compartment , and so do not provide power to the clock for it to run ! a clock that do not run be no use to I or anyone else . I be return the new clock along with several other I order with the same problem .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the product I receive do not work . after a few hour the clock would start flash , as though it have shut off and then turn on again . the time setting would be lose . I return the product .
AlarmClock	POS	4	Easy to read . Easy to set . not for the heavy sleeper . the alarm do a gradual buildup in volume . even at it be loudest it be not very loud . it be plenty for I . my son be a heavy sleeper and the alarm on this clock would be worthless .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock never work . the light do not come on and the alarm make no sound . this be a piece of junk . I be surprised Amazon would sell this clock it be such poor quality .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be take a upcoming exam and need a clock that help I on time control . when I receive it , it be much bigger than I think , but it be not necessary a bad thing . it be easier for I to spot it wherever I put it on the desk . what I like this clock the best be that it be silent . you do not hear the second hand movement like most other quartz clock do . I also like other feature of this clock , like it glow in the dark , and progress alarm sound , etc. . plus the price be very affordable .
AlarmClock	POS	5	buy this product because it show 2 different time zone so you can set it such that it show the time where you be and where you be love one be when you be travel or live in other part of the world . have not use it as a alarm yet . it be small and do not weigh much and easy to put on you nightstand for example .
AlarmClock	POS	5	Got 2 of these for my nephew for Christmas . they love they . as of today there have be problem with they . great product that sure make 2 5 year old boy happy .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this little clock be exactly what I expect and seem to work fine , so far . the blue backlight be nice . one small complaint - I do not think qa be top on the list with the maufacturer - on mine , the snooze button be upside down ! it still work , just look a bit odd . but what can you expect for the price ?
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this radio as a Christmas present for a office mate . I want something small and not too expensive since in a office building thing can disapear . the reception in the building be ususaly not so good and that be a concern . three month later I be happy to report that this one work fine . we have have no problem with the radio or the CD player .
AlarmClock	POS	5	buy this clock at Fred Meyers tonight on sale . $ 7.99 . if it hold up , it will make a good travel clock . the alarm be just loud enough , and annoying enough to wake one up if they go to bed sober . the pic show the light but you need to `` pinch '' the button to make it lite up . it have control for each select option . but not fore and back , so if you go past just keep go . but I buy it so I could see the time . my XM radio time be only 6 mm high so I need something else this 25 mm display be what I need . and when the power go out it will wake I because it do not give up till the button be hit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	it have be a long and arduous journey for I to find a home theater system that meet two simple expectation . when I finally find this system it not only meet those simple expectation , it blow they away . this be the third system that I have purchase , the other -lrb- a Sony and a Kenwood -rrb- be not pass muster . my first expectation be that the sound system should work , and the Kenwood fail here when its Subwoofer stop work in a literal cloud of smoke . my second expectation be that it should sound good , and this be where the Sony fail . this onkyo system sound so much better than those other model in the $ 300 to $ 350 price range that I would gladly pay twice that after have to set-up and return two system . the package be deliver by freight -lrb- for Free by Crutchfield , whom I also recommend -rrb- and it be a large , heavy box . the receiver have some real heft to it , and appear to be very well make . the speaker be much larger than the standard fare with home theater system right now , and you will be glad they be once you hear they . there be six speaker in total , include three surround . the subwoofer have a powerful ten inch driver that will really add reinforcement to action movie and good soundtrack . there be 1000 watt in total go to all seven speaker . this be a setup that be better suit for a larger room , mine be about 15 ' by 30 ' . it would probably overpower a room that be not big enough . the system itself be a little complicated to figure out but have many feature . there be a build in crossover for the subwoofer that can be set from 80-150hz , and the volume can be adjust for each speaker . Make sure you have a optical cable from to connect the dvd player to it to fully take advantage of 6.1 surround . one of the most important aspect of a system be have a well design remote control . the remote control for this unit be a little large , but the button be spread out and illuminate for ease of use , although I have not yet figure out what they all do . this system also have the ability to play a stereo signal through all of its speaker , something the Sony and Kenwood system could not do . the Onkyo will also take a 5.1 signal and convert it to a 6.1 signal by blend the left\/right rear signal together into a rear center signal . there be also a `` late night '' feature that will make quiet noise louder and the loud noise softer so that you can listen to a movie quietly and still hear everything , among other feature that I have not yet get around to discover . be warn , this system be not the easiest to set up or to operate , but the result can not be deny . it work . it sound good . buy it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	ok its not as good as the bose system , but for the fraction of the price it be good . I really can not tell the difference between mine system and my brother bose which cost 1500 dollar more without a dvd player . if you have super sensitive ear and you loaded get the `` bose system '' if you look for a dvd\/audio theater system that sound great , play cd , dvd and really look good too , get the panasonic
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I order this system because I want to put new speaker on my exist surround sound system . read the review on Amazon , I expect the subwoofer to be weak -lrb- it be -rrb- , but I expect the speaker to be good to excellent . they be fair . this be actually the first item in my multi-year history as a Amazon shopper that I be go to the trouble to return . the speaker system I order for my computer sound better . if you just need a cheap system that be better than the speaker on you tv , this might be good for you . otherwise , shop around and maybe spend just a little more .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	this system have no digital input , so if you want to use it with a xbox or a PlayStation 2 for dolby\/dts playback , you be out of luck .  consider yourself warn .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this product be a great value . I watch x-man 2 last night and the sound be incredible . it be easy to install , but if you have a cable box be sure to use the direction come with the cable box because the direction that come with the unit be poor -lrb- just a diagram that show EVERY type of configuration on one page -rrb- . also , the sub-woofer come with a annoying sticker on it that take 1\/2 a hour to get off . I highly recommend this unit for sound quality and price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	set up could not be easier ... right out-of-the-box . assembly be simple and connection be clearly describe . if you have the Panasonic HD tv with arc and Blu-Ray , no problem . you will need to have 3 hdmus cable : -lrb- 2 -rrb- output - from you cable box or satellite box and disc player to the subwoofer and one for the output from the subwoofer to the ARC connection on you tv . no arc ? check out the other review . the sound be a amazing improvement from the tv speaker . watch avatar on Blu-Ray and the sound and picture just blow I away . if you have a small to medium size room , this system be for you . no hesitation on the 5 star .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	First off , let I say that I be satisfied with the system . it be not go to rattle the window or wake the neighbor - but for ordinary movie watch with clear sound effect it be a good value . I have have this system for about 8 month and very seldom use the dvd . last night we purchase lose in translation and the dvd skip during the preview , then the player refuse to load the dvd after I eject and clean the disc . long story short , I hack the system accord to matta2k 's instruction later in this message board and now it work perfectly . we 'll see if I be still satisfy at the end of the year .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I happy to have it ! it be work and look like new . very good item especially for such price .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	my family buy the RCA blu-ray rtb1100 during the after-thanksgiving sale . we get it all hook up only to have the blu-ray player freeze up multiple time . we exchange it for another one . again the blu-ray player freeze up in the middle of the movie . we try different blu-ray and dvd and the same thing happen . we be very frustrated and will be replace it with another brand .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this to replace a LG fd-790 vintage 2007 which die . I want Blu-Ray so buy this instead of fix the LG . I consider another LG but read all the bad review about the wireless rear speaker not work so pass . I be a Amazon Prime subscriber and want something that could stream instant video as my tv be a lg 47lbx which be not internet ready . I do not want a separate boxee type thing or htpc because of technology issue of another family member and tv watcher . the good thing be it all work and be relatively easy to setup . the bad thing for I be : 1 I try to register for my Sony Essentials account but it turn out that if you already have a sonystyle.com online account it be the same thing so I lock my exist account try to register . this result in a extended phone wait and multiple transfer to have my account reset . then streaming work . 2 I install the MediaRemote for Android by Sony on my Samsung Infuse and it work except the Network Services function have a place for username and password but no way to navigate to the password at least not on my phone . 3 as mention in other review there be no equalizer . my wife say the bass boom too much . I have it set to -6 db which be as turn down as it go . I may have to put a pillow under it or something . I know other have comment on the poor bass response of the other speaker but no complaint on that . I have try the various audio mode but none of they seem to cut the subwoofer volume relative to other speaker or frequency response much . 4 program the radio preset be a pain and non-intuitive but it work and I hope to never do it again
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this unit from Amazon about 6 month ago . I must admit , this be a very stylish system with very low profile . the dvd player itself be very very slim . it be wider than normal component though . sound be pretty decent . I have not have any problem with the sound . some folk have complain about the subwoofer be weak . but in my setup it be deliver robust and rich bass . I think this unit be not mean to be in a very big room . in small room sound be great . the remote feel flimsy . I be scared one day may 20 month old daughter be go to break it and my system will be unusable . sometimes the button need to be press hard . and since there be no indicator lead on the remote , you can not tell if the button get press or not . little annoying . it do not play dvd-rw or dvd + rw . I think this day and age all dvd player need to handle the above format .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I be please with the the video and audio quality of this system . however , the 5-disc tray take a long time to load\/rotate and the dvd player be very picky . it would not play some of the dvd I purchase overseas -lrb- ntsc & region-free -rrb- that play fine in my other , less expensive , dvd player .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	do not buy this unit . there be a problem with it over heating and cause a loud poping sound after a couple hour of use . I talk with Panasonic about this and they will not admit to the problem , however , you can find several other people that have have the same problem on the net .  when ask for replacement unit , I be tell that I would have to take it to my local repair center to have a tech look at the unit . this unit be still under warrenty and it be go to take several day for the unit to be repair . no sound or dvd while this take place . I will never buy another Panasonic unit again , to bad because this be the best unit I find on the market . Guess next time I 'll pay the extra money and get a Sony ! at least they care about they customer .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I purchase this product , along with a Samsung 55 '' lcd tv and Logitech Harmony one . I love it !! Samsung be make amazing product with great price point . because I go from a 27 '' tube tv with no ss , I be still in shock from the amazing picture and sound my new set up be put out . one recommendation I would make be to purchase a Logitech remote also . go from 4 remote controll to 1 be amazingly easy and reduce clutter . I be by no means electronically knowledgable but be able to set up the tv , surround sound system and remote in about 3 hour ! my only complaint be the blu-ray player do not always `` tune '' to the right setting when go from `` watch dvd '' to `` watch cable '' . this be easily fix by go through the help menu on the Logitech -lrb- take about 5 button push -rrb- . overall , I be completely satisfy with what Samsung have provide , customer service be so helpful and be able to trouble shoot via internet chat be very nice , no holding on the phone !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be very happy with this purchase . have check around at a lot of place and find nothing this good for the price !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	do not buy this product . the input in the back of the receiver do not work and will not work . i have it replace twice already and both have the same problem , so i be think its the product that be defective . i have a wius , xbox and ps3 and when i plug it in the back input system , only the audio work , but not the video . there be no video display in the tv . i have even call Sony customer service dept and they could not help I . they even tell I its because i have a sony bravium hdmus hdtv , that the high definition be not set correctly , but when i try it on my other tv , the sony trinitron regular crt tv , it do not work either . so the system be defective when it come to input receiver , other than this , the product deliver awesome sound that be very impressive .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I buy this unit in January 2006 from bbuy . I admit I be mainly look for a surround sound system but the price seem reasonable and with all the other feature -lrb- 5-disc changer , divx capable , etc. -rrb- I think what the heck . at first I do not really use the dvd player that much , but when I do I have a problem with a few disc skip after about a hour into the movie , at the time I just figure the disc themselves be bad , like I say I do not use it to watch many movie . well recently my wife start work at a movie rental store , so with free rental we have start watch a lot more movie . now I see that the dvd function on this unit be basically useless , pretty much every movie we play begin to skip and then freeze at about a hour and fifteen minute into the movie . I know it be not the disc , sometimes she get free unopened movie as promotional item and the same thing happen , a hour and fifteen minute or so into the movie it begin to skip , every single time now . I have try disc cleaner with no luck . after some research online , it seem that alot of people have the same exact problem with all type of samsung dvd player . maybe there be just a few bad unit float around out there but nonetheless I would recommend go with another brand .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	ok , maybe I be on a little bit of a `` jihad '' here against these up-converting dvd player , but bear with I because I do have a valid point . do not buy any dvd player because it can `` up-convert to hd '' . evaluate all dvd player on whether they do everything else well , or have the connection you need -lrb- DVI , HDMI , etc. -rrb- or the price be in you budget . this may be a fine dvd player , but do not buy it just because it can up-convert , and do not use the up-convert capability of this player even if you do buy it . if you tv can accept 720p or higher input via DVI or HDMI , then it be already scale the image to fit the native resolution of the display device . and I guarantee you it be do a better job of it than any sub-200 dollar dvd player be go to do . -lrb- if not , then you hdtv be poorly make -rrb- . my final point : if this up-coverting technology be such a good idea , why be Samsung the only one do it ? why not Pioneer , Panasonic , Sony , JVC , and Denon ? -lrb- because they know it be usless technology -rrb- .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I do not know much about sound system and already have 5 speaker set up for surround sound use a Onkyo receiver . I expect to be able to plug everything in to the receiver and have 7.1 surround but that be not the case . if you do not have a receiver , you can plug the two speaker into the subwoofer and the subwoofer into the tv and you better sound than if you just have the tv speaker . however , if you be like I , the jack on the subwoofer can not plug into the port on the receiver . thus , I have 7 speaker for lovely surround sound with not bass . still , speaker look very nice in front of my tv and I have the connect as one long shiny black bar . you also have the option of stand they up on either side of you tv as show in the picture .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	after a long review other product , this be the best , the price , the function and option be great . we connect the blue-ray -lrb- hdmus in -rrb- , set-top box -lrb- hdmus in -rrb- , netbook -lrb- hdmus in -rrb- and internet radio -lrb- logitech , via optical in -rrb- , and it work without any problem , video go to a lead tv , if you want to watch something -lrb- hdmus out -rrb- . the only thing to check be the installation of the three speaker box : one front soundbar -lrb- with 3 speaker , 3 cable -rrb- , 2 surround and 1 subwoofer , after finish it , and the hdmus connection be ready , all be ok , then , listen the best sound in a really small size
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this unit and i be surprised find out that it have a great audio , nice bass , however it lack treble and bass control . I have to replace the unit due to problem with the power unit a week after I purchase it , now afer 3 month it skip some dvd 's during playback . also , the fan make alot of noise for its size .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I buy this system Xmas 2001 . ... there a few `` nagging item '' I would of like do differently but overall I be very pleased .  the good 1 -rrb- sound great ! the subwoofer & -lrb- 5 -rrb- satellite speaker be nice look & compact . and the output be plenty for we 12 ' x 16 ' room . 2 -rrb- Plays virtually all type of CD 's perfectly . I use dvd , CD-audio , CD-R & CD-RW with MP3s . I have encounter no skip problem . 3 -rrb- I plug my exist CD changer & my HiFi VCR into it be RCA jack . these component be integrate well . 4 -rrb- 5.1 Dolby Digital dvd output . 5 -rrb- dvd playback feature be adequate . Picture quality be perfect -lrb- of course - it be digital -rrb- .  the bad 1 -rrb- no dvd zoom or similar feature I have see on other player . not a real big deal to I ... 2 -rrb- no built-in DTS decoder . again not a big deal to I as Dolby digital kick ! 3 -rrb- it take approx 5 sec to `` read '' a disc before any playback can begin . 4 -rrb- there be no text display for mp3 file & the unit do not `` chapter '' folder the way some unit I have see will . for instance if you have individual album in separate folder , you can not `` chapter '' from folder-to-folder . this unit only skip track although you can type in a `` go-to '' track # .  the ugly 1 -rrb- very slow disc change . I time it at about 12 sec . almost best to consider it a single disc player . 2 -rrb- mp3 playback seem to be limit to a maximum of 160 kbp encode rate . this be annoying to I as I have many recording at 192 + kbps and this unit will jump\/skip at high bit-rate . 3 -rrb- the unit tend to get hot seemingly due to it be `` Energy Star '' compliance that cycle the fan on\/off . I actually return the 1st unit I would purchase think the fan be not work . after get the 2nd one and watch the fan , I realize it cycle . take heed and install in a ventilate area with good air flow !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	while this player recognize and play back dvd-r and dvd-rw , it would stop and stutter at various play point . very annoying . these same disk play in about five other brand I test without stutter -lrb- Pioneer , Apex , Toshiba ... -rrb-  I get this ... open-box item at a north Seattle best buy , but I still have to take it back -- too bad . the price be very good and the surround sound be pretty good .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I think I would give KLH a try base on several review that this company make good gear . this be a big disappointment . these speaker have nothing - they sound like tin can . now you could say you get what you pay for , but I honestly can not find anything nice to say about they . they have no bass , the midrange be muddy - seem like a few octave be simply miss , and the high be loud , but not crisp . the subwoofer be somewhat decent , but its not really 50 watt . it be 25 watt RMS , 50 watt peak . RMS should be the only rating you look at , as it be a more standardized measure of power . I return mine to the store
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	fairly easy to set up to play music , but when it come to hook it up to you tv or gaming system , that be where it can get a bit confusing . nothing I could not figure out though . this system be set up in my bedroom -lrb- 20x20ft -rrb- , it get very loud ; any louder and I would be deaf . the only complaint I have be that I can not get my center speaker to play . I have my ipod hook up and all the other speaker be play except for that one . that be the sole reason for the 4 star review , else it would be 5 star . overall , great sound system .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	my wife and I just move into we first house and after year of live in a cramped apartment , I be finally able to splurge on entertainment product for we living room . while I have do a ton of research for nearly everything else in my set-up , I take a chance on this system and be reasonably happy so far . for whatever reason , I have buy nothing but Samsung product for we living room . 52 '' lcd tv and Blu-Ray player . I figure I would stick to the same name brand for the htib system . on the plus side , the sound quality be pretty solid , especially during sport event . it be really , really nice . music sound fine on it , too . the set-up be fairly painless , as long as you follow the instruction closely . I love that it have 4 hdmus input , which be great since I have a cable box , xbox 360 and Blu-Ray player . it make it far easier to change input , compare to have to navigate HDMI input with the television 's own controller . I be absolutely blow away by the sound of the system when play call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 . fantastic stuff . my living room be a very odd shape and design , and for that reason I be glad this system have the ASC device to balance the sound . Picture if you will a rectangle on its side . my tv be in the upper right corner . a bay window take up nearly the entire right wall . the top\/north wall have a fireplace that jut out . the bottom\/south wall be where one couch be , but the staircase to go up stair be behind it , so there be actually only 1\/2 a wall there . the left\/west wall have a love seat , and the south-left corner lead directly into the kitchen area . that make it incredibly difficult to figure out where exactly to place the speaker . the ASC mic do a pretty good job get the volume level from each speaker balanced . I just wish there be a way to figure out the best speaker position without spend money to have some Geek Squad guy come out to the house . on the downside , the rear speaker be not wireless , although the cable be certainly long enough . when hang on the wall , the speaker also do not have a indentation to run the wire through , so the speaker hang on the wall weirdly . the system can not expand to 7.1 channel , but I know that when I purchase it . the system be fairly new , so my Harmony one remote have to be manually program . this have lead to a few occasion where the avr do not change input , despite repeatedly hit button on the remote . occasionally during commercial on tv , the sound will momentarily drop out for a second or so . I can not explain that one . I be also amaze by the amount of dust the speaker and avr attract . my wife and I keep we house spotless , but dust still find its way to the system and it be hard not to notice it on the shiny surface . despite my best effort , it seem like everything be cover in dust by the end of the day . I also have a Nintendo Wii , which have a composite output , and I still can not figure out how to connect it to the avr . the video input be there for a composite connection , but I be unclear where the audio get plug in . I be not a fan of the ipod connection , either . once you connect a ipod or iPhone , there be no way to select a song or playlist or anything ... the device just play . I have to set the avr to `` Video iPod '' in order to navigate the ipod and play the music\/playlist I want to . a minor annoyance , but a annoyance nonetheless . as this be my first htib , I really enjoy the hw-c560 and I hope to get quite a few good year out of it . that say , my next home theater purchase will be a larger , better set-up that work better with the living room .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I be on my fourth head unit , and this one only work intermittently . dvd do not play , sound cut out , on and on . also , worst remote ever . what be tragic be that while the head unit be clearly a piece of junk , the speaker be all great , and it sound fantastic when it work . now Cambridge be not sell these any more . no surprise .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this item be a great value for the price . the sound be very clear , and I can only turn it up to 3\/4 before it scare the dog . all-in-all , I feel that I get more than what I pay for . another plus -- the set up be very easy .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this definitely be not a professional sound set up if youre look for one . it work alright for my and my friend play music through we laptop , and i plug it into the tv for movie . the sub be not up to par , sound very fake . the whole thing look straight out of the 90 's . not have a separate counsel to point the remote at get old too . the remote they give you control the way the sound come out of the speaker , BUT also happen too be the size of 3 stamp line up . mean I lose it almost daily . sound quality be alright . can get a bit fuzzy when it be louder , and im pretty sure i blow a speaker already too . it be cheap though , so for the money i recommend it . I just learn my lesson to put a little more money in it next time .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	solid unit with a nice universal remote include . good fm receiver , good dvd playback , powerful surround sound . it just `` feel '' like a well-built system . I have see cheaper unit for sale , but I do not regret pay a little extra for something of this quality .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	the system be way better than I expect it to be . be the system be so cheap I be expect something loud , but not clear and i be wrong . everything be so clear , the bass hit perfectly , and you feel fully immerse into movie , game , and anything you watch on tv . I purchase this to go alongside my PS3 and Samsung TV and it work flawlessly with the two . the PS3 will auto sync with the system to output at the best possible setting , and then do so . the only drawback that I can find . it do not come with any hdmus cable so be sure to buy they . the `` out '' on the system be through HDMI so in order for you to have everything hook up to the unit and go to the tv you need hdmus . if you do not have hdmus then you can still run the sound from the tv to the unit , but you will need to manually adjust all the setting on the PS3 etc. . . to suit the output of the unit . the only way to truly experience the full power of the unit and full surround sound clarity you will need HDMI hook up though , so either way . I be only get two channel sound quality when I wasnt use HDMI . if you do not have it setup correctly setting like pro Logic make the rear speaker extremely quiet . however when you go in depth , the unit do offer a microphone adjustment tool . you setup the microphone and it adjust accordinly . its osmething id expect from system costing hundred of dollar more . from what ive mess with I dont think you can go in and adjust the subwoofer though . overall turn up this system sound absolutely phenomonial especially in smaller room , but it excel in larger room too . the nice thing be you can turn it down and still get amazing sound quality , but the sub get quiet and you not wake up neighbor all night . it take less than a half hour to set it up , and since then ive be blow away one way or another . its absolutely worth the price its at , would probably even buy it if it be higher to be honest .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I just receive this theater system yesterday and it be wonderful . I find it very easy to setup , the direction be very easy to follow and understand even if you be not electronically incline . plus the manual be not a 100 page book you have to read to learn how to run the system . < br \/ > < br \/ > I love the design of the system also . Panasonic make the dvd 5 disc changer look really cool by make the front of it look like a mirror . also around the volume knob , it glow with blue light when you turn the system on . the speaker be silver and have a nice design . the tall -lrb- long -rrb- speaker be the front speaker and the smaller one go in the back of the room . the nice thing be that all the speaker be capable of hang on the wall . also , pole that be attach to the tall front speaker -lrb- as show in the picture -rrb- can be use for the back speaker instead if you like . so there be option with this system . < br \/ > < br \/ > the performance of the system be amazing and at the price I get it for , you can `` t go wrong . the dvd player be quick when change disc and quiet . there be also a lot of setup option . you can ajust the subwoofer level from the remote , many different picture view , sound setting for cd 's , and speaker adjustment to name a few . also , there be ton of input for you extra device . I have the VCR and 3 game system hook up to it . I also like the fact that it have the option for component cable hook up for the tv . I buy some of those cable last night and the picture do look better . I love the subwoofer . it be pretty hefty but definately worth it . there be 4 different bass level you can set it on and it be POWERFUL . I put in the chronicle of Riddick and it shake the floor and my cat hide for the rest of the night . you have to be careful though . I live in a apartment and the bass can be hear clearly and heavily outside the apartment and I do not have the volume up very loud at all . but with the subwoofer adjustment , you can find a setting that work best for you . < br \/ > < br \/ > I suggest this product for everyone . it work so great and it be such a good value for the money that I be tell all my friend about it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	great sound with this product . obviously it be not fancy or expensive , but for the price and ease of setup , this be worth it .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	it take I several hour to figure out that the back speaker wire -lrb- and associate plug -rrb- be not attach to the plastic casing that cover the connection port on the speaker . the wire be loose through a hole in that plastic cover\/housing . Vizio could have mention this configuration in the manual , with some sort of easy picture ... but NO. . I think there be some other issue with the unit that I keep try to diagnose . plus , I keep see review and complaint about how the back speaker do not work for some folk . finally , before call they support line -lrb- which I be scare to do -rrb- , I try one last time and luck out to find this configuration . what you need to do be pull some of the wire through the plastic cover\/casing . then , connect the wire\/plug to the back speaker connection , make certain that the plug be secure\/firmly in the outlet . finally , move the plastic cover along the wire and attach the cover to the back of the speaker . TA DA ! it work . it be so stupid and I be so angry for they not be any specific advice about this anywhere -lrb- even on the internet -rrb- . the only thing the manual mention be : the wire to the back speaker may come loose in transport and may need to be reattach . however , the manual do not tell you , specifically , how to reattach that wire . I hope this help those who be have fit , like I do . beyond that , this piece seem to be a pretty good solution and sound pretty good , or at least good enough for my sister : - -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	this system be the next evolution of the ht900 and ht920 . both of which have design flaw . I speak with a panasonic service engineer about the ht900 and he verify a pop noice come from my sub be a know issue with the sub , but no recall be issue . after 3 month of discussion they replace with 920 . after own a little over a year I have issue with the sub on this system also . there local certified repair company tell I there be a issue with the design of the circuit board on this system . different problem from the 900 . they say they though Pansonic would replace but after numerous conversation they do not . they make good tv but low quality home theater in a Box and do not stand behind they product .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	hus we purchase this unit in April , 2005 for almost over $ 400.00 . this unit do not have review by then . we think since we be put good money we get a pretty decent system but the performance be not what we expect . it can not play dvd for more than 2 or 3 hour . after that it continually try to read but unsuccessful . please do not buy this unit at all . try look for a SONY or BOSE if you can afford . lesson learn be beware what you buy and let other write review about the unit then you buy . thanks .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy this product before Christmas and be amaze by the quality . it be under $ 50 ! I must emphasize I have a very small living room and I do not think this would do much in anything bigger . but if you be look for surround sound for you bedroom or a small living room DO IT !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	if you be look for a all-in-one home theater system with all the new goody , then this be definitely the one to look for . at -lrb- $ $ $ -rrb- , it have pro logic ii , a feature not usually find on other system with similar price , which actually convert you normal stereo sound to 5.1 surround -lrb- now my tv sound surround ! -rrb- . it also have progressive scan too , a big plus . it play mp3 , VCD , CD-R\/RW beside dvd . furthermore , the player look very cool with its metallic casing .  on the minus side , the speaker look mediocre like some -lrb- low-end -rrb- computer speaker , but the sound be clear and crisp . the remote that come with it look like -lrb- low-end -rrb- plastic , very unattractive . anyway , what I really care be the numerous function of the remote .  in short , if you be look for a budget home theater with all the function , then this be the one you should go for .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have be use a Panasonic sc-ht740 5 dvd home Theater System for about nine month and I have be very satisfied . I enjoy my home unit enough to recently purchase a second sc-ht740 for work . here be seven benefit and drawback . benefit : 1 -rrb- the sound quality be excellent when play cd , cd-r , dvd , dvd-r and the radio . 2 -rrb- the bass can be adjust to multiple level . 3 -rrb- the tv 's audio signal can be play through the system . 4 -rrb- the theater can be expand to use a second room speaker . on one of my unit , I use the  sh-fx80  it have issue , but it be worth it . on my other system , I use the  sh-fx60  it work very well . 5 -rrb- the unit hold five disc . 6 -rrb- the system will accept a ipod . 7 -rrb- the unit be physically attractive . drawback : 1 -rrb- the remote control have so many feature that it be difficult to learn and use . 2 -rrb- there be no way to access different video angle . my old dvd remote have a button to select different angle for compatible disc . 3 -rrb- other than the bass level , there be no equalizer to micro-manage the audio signal . 4 -rrb- the remote do not work with my Sony television . 5 -rrb- the sh-fx60 -lrb- wireless rear speaker kit -rrb- and sh-fx80 -lrb- second room speaker -rrb- can not be use on the same unit simultaneously . 6 -rrb- the system be not compatible with pal or sacd disc . 7 -rrb- I often get wavy line on the screen for about five minute . customer service tell I to change the yellow video cable . I have use three different cable -lrb- one of which be gold plate -rrb- and the problem persist . instead of the cable , it may have something to do with the main unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	need a space-saving system with big sound ? buy this now !! Panasonic have do really well with this baby . the sound be excellent with both music and movie . and the system be pack with feature such as hdcd , highmat and jpeg decoder . unusually , mp3 disc sound great here , and my track be 160kbp !! oh , the tuner sound really good too . the system sound excellent even at low volume . so there be some merit to the not-too-tasteless bi-amp logo in the front . it be very nearly perfect but ... I briefly test dvd on the system but be use the supply cable for normal composite video , and the color be a bit muted . but I suspect the crappy cable be the demon here , and anyway when I get my own tv I 'll be use the component video output which should be much better . there be s-video output too . to nitpick further dvd be reset when the system go to standby , but luckily there be a memory function which be dead quick to use . the engineer be obviously on cheap drug when they make this oversight . but there be a 5 disc memory , yes this system be a 5-disc changer !! and lastly the remote , good luck if you have chunky finger heh heh heh ! Tips : the speaker cable length supply be miserly , consider get additional length , and do not worry the sound will not deteriorate . I have have to extend they by 4 metre with a different type and I buy cheapo , which mean a extra 16 metre for myself as the Panny be bi-wired - which probably account in part for the great sound . a pain but worth it . for music listening by all account play with the Equalizer but leave the Surround off , it be a bit too artificial . leave the equalizer on , even if leave on the flat Manual mode , the sound open up a bit . the Audio only mode make no audible difference , so leave it off and save you chunky finger ! the blue backlighting look nice but there be a dimmer if it get distractive . yes those engineer think of everything but leave a half-assed resume . for movie , by all account play with the Surround ! all in all this be a great system . and in the States it be a no-brain bargain . and do I mention the speaker look great !! take the grill off !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	order on amazon.com , for way less than anywhere else i could find it . same price at local `` best buy '' as the model below , the fc7 .  for I , im not a expert , the sound be great , i have a bose system before this and it sound way better that that .  install easily but 3 minor grumble . 1 . the surround sound cable be not long enough have to go buy some more . 2 . Doesnt come with Wall mount for the surround sound , why ?! seem like most people have surround speaker in the ceiling or on the wall . 3 . cant connect my Dish Receiver video out through the same video out as the dvd , so i have to switch both the tv and the receiver . no idea why , just wil live with it .  anyway i like sony product be now look for a plasma screen to go with it ! happy listening
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	overall I be and still be very impressed with the sound and build quality of the system . however the main negative point that irritate I be the fact the the system have hardly any connectivity , especially that there be no digital input , which as the AUXILLARLY curcuit ` only ' support Dolby Pro-Logic , unable I to watch sky movie and use my XBOX etc in Dolby 5.1 as intend , and as I have pay over # 350 for the device be disappointing .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be a very nice home theater , excelent sound , very easy to install and worth any dollar you pay for it . I like very much it speaker , small in size e big in sound . very nice complement to my PS3 .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I have be very happy with this setup -lrb- for the money -rrb- with the exception of a out of sync issue when change from one digital channel to another on by cable stb . I have to change the channel on my box to one of the channel in the analog spectrum -lrb- 1-78 -rrb- then switch back to the `` digital '' channel to sync the audio and video back up . annoying and frustrating . this be not the fault of my stb because I do not have the problem unless the receiver be in the mix .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	like the feature , but after set it up find the GUI be totally unusable . the remote send command , -lrb- I could see the red light on the reciever blink ... -rrb- but it would not respond ... it act like it be run Windows for the OS and be try to load outlook or something . LG customer service be useless . what a waste of time !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	could not have ask for a easier transaction and delivery for a great home theater system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	Easy set up and connect to wifi easily . however , disc player result in tv screen go blank in the middle of dvd 's for a second or so in the middle of program , in some case multiple time . menu for multus episode dvd often do not play . Software would not update through wifus which Samsung customer support -lrb- call several time -rrb- attribute to higher than usual call volume -lrb- for a week -rrb- , server problem -lrb- for a week -rrb- , and in one case the guy blame my tv -lrb- ironically also a Samsung -rrb- . customer support be not very helpful . sound quality be mediocre and wireless rear speaker almost useless . however , the blank screen experience and inability to get this fix make the unit useless and I return it since it be defective . my guess be that Samsung have not develop the software and that they home theater unit should be avoid .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	just unboxed this - so far love this system . contrary to other review , you can replace the speaker quite easily , the speakerwire into the unit be a proprietary clip , but the speakerwire into the speaker be just bare wire with a basic clip so you can just use that end to connect to you exist speaker . the only glitch we have run into be streaming Hulu - for some reason this unit will not let we downgrade to standard defn streaming and as a result , Hulu do not stream well . -lrb- we use a PS3 for Hulu and it work great in the same location on standard definition -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I purchase this when it be on sale during black Friday week and just recently set it up as it be a Christmas present . . why bother say that , well , I probably should have research a little more before make the purchase , but it be a really slick deal and well , I just go for it . that be say , the number one reason I decide on this particular system be the Wi-Fi `` build in '' option as list in the product description . dongles\/adapters suck . they always have . I do not want one so I buy the one system on sale at that time that say `` build in Wi-Fi . '' well , build in means that the dongle come in the box rather than have to purchase one separately . I think about send it back immediately on principle , but I probably should have do more homework before buy so I just decide to give it a shot . -lrb- I be sure it say `` built-in '' = adapter somewhere else -- like say in the other review here -rrb- first night : set everything up , let software upgrade , wireless work , netflix work . sound great , I mean it , it really sound good for the sale price . . Ok , I think , not so bad , at least I do not need to run more ethernet wire ... Day two : turn it on , go to try pandora -lrb- which be great on this by the way -rrb- I get a error that it could not connect due to `` Network interference '' . . ok check network setting , only `` wire '' be a option . Unplugged and plug in the dongle . . it give I `` wireless '' as a option again but do not recognize any wireless network . . long story short , the dongle fry itself or be just on the edge of self-destruction when it be throw in the box . . I spend WAY TOO MUCH TIME try to get it to work . I would not have spend this kind of time if it be not for the fact that it actually work at first . anyhow , first call to Samsung . not so great . nice enough tech but she final recommendation be to buy another dongle . I stay polite and non-confrontational and just ask if she be sure that this would not be cover by warranty . she say yes . well , ok , I think she be wrong and thank she for she time . I decide to just wire the thing to my laptop and try updates\/see if there be newer firmware\/etc . . also it allow I to try chat support . both time , they be very quick to respond and nice enough . no earth shatter troubleshooting but they do explain how to reset the unit to factory default -lrb- hold down the stop button for 5 seconds while there be no dvd in it . . -rrb- cool . I do that , try the dongle some more . . etc. . no luck so they give I the number to call for tier ii tech support -- -rrb- this number be just the regular customer service number and there be no option for tier 2 in the menu . . ok . . I get another tech and ask for Tier 2 . . she -lrb- Kasey -rrb- say she could try some stuff and ok I go for it . SHE WAS great . I mean it , truly a breath of fresh air in the oft malodorous world of `` support '' . I be perfectly ok with the the win some lose some sort of attitude one must have when call tech support\/customer service for anything . every company have some really good people answer they phone -- -rrb- it be just rare to get someone so good on call 2 . . anyhow , she listen to what I have try , suggest a few thing to rule out error elsewhere , and then just send out a new dongle for I to try . Perfect . . no unnecessary nonsense , and it be good to know that the first tier people you get at samsung be empower enough to actually issue replacement part without have to talk you way up the chain -- you just need a bit of luck for who answer when call in I guess . in the interim , I just run more cable and I have the unit run that way . it work great this way so I doubt i 'll even use the dongle except to maybve see if it just incinerate itself as the previous one must have do . short Version for the rest of the review : feature : five Stars - Netflix , Vudu , Pandora , you Tube , all work great and great quality ! nice . wi-fus : one star - not as advertised - not `` build in '' sound '' four star - very admirable for the price error message : one star - they really be terrible -- there be more I encounter , but say `` Network interference '' as a error message when the unit do not even recognize that the dongle be plug in be just absurd . . they should just say `` error '' for everything as that would be about as useful as the error message that they actually give and at least will not mislead you . coolness stuff : the WLAN adapter port on the back be just a usb port . . this be cool because you can throw a memory stick\/poratble harddrive back there full of pic and a video or whatever and just leave it there out of site . . there be a usb port on the front as well which be design in a way to prevent you from pug in the WLAN dongle in the front . . however , plug a hub into it would allow you to use the front though i do not know why you would want to other than for troubleshooting -lrb- I be test to make sure that it be the dongle and not just the usb port on the back -rrb- more coolness : I have plug three different brand of usb memory stick and 2 different portable hard drive into it and it recognize all of they and allow quick access to music\/pictures\/video etc. . . -lrb- also a network hard drive -rrb- I can not comment on what format it accept , but it seem to have good coverage . . -lrb- though it do not recognize a . wav file -rrb- one big plus , my video folder on my portable hardrive crash window explorer on my xp laptop and on a xp desktop but it do not crash this unit . . nice ! overall , I be very happy with the system now that I have the internet wire . I can not give it more than three star though because it be not really as advertised and the dongle fry itself . if they actually have the wireless build in and it work , it would be five star for sure ... please , please , please Samsung , stop use adapters\/dongles\/whatever ... I know it be a money make thing , but it very nearly result in a return and still would be it not for the other good feature of this product . anyhow , as long as you know that you be not actually get build in Wi-Fi , you should be very happy with this system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	its hard to write a single line for this product its a piece of junk , i buy this a year and half ago . Dont now wher to contact i try all over again and again no reply finally get to trash i sujjest please dont buy this filty product and make ur mode ... nothing be good about this product ... accept speaker good luck ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	the system work well for the first two week or so ; after the return deadline expire , it start skip while play my ipod . that problem have grow and include the FM radio , too . I wish it malfunction earlier ... kind of upset that the return be not go to get much of my money back .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this review may be premature as I have be use this product only for a week . however , some thing immediately stand out : 1 . it do NOT produce surround sound and it be not mean to . so do not be fool by the `` Air surround extreme '' kinda jargon . you will clearly hear sound come out of the speaker bar and that be about it . do not expect sound to bounce off the wall and come at you from the side or from behind you . I be use a optical cable to connect the tv to the receiver . not sure hdmus would make any difference . 2 . the receiver be simple and the build in subwoofer have solid bass performance . I have to bring the bass volumne down to 1 to keep it manageable . this be where you will feel it when watch a movie . it do a excellent job of amplify low frequency without distortion . 3 . unit work with tha harmony 700 remote . 4 . you will have to run setup and crank up the center speaker volume to be able to hear human voice , else they get subdue by the music . out of the box , I could hardly hear actor speak . change to the center column to a 5 or 6 -lrb- max -rrb- do the trick . I be impressed by the sub , but let down by the bar speaker - they sound exactly like desktop speaker . it be a $ 300 system and sound like one . if you be on a budget , I would recommend it . if not , keep look .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	buy this system , on recommendation , in June 2003 . System develop a `` pop '' sound and would shut itself down . by the beginning of August 2003 , I finally get the replacement system and the same problem occur two month later - October 2003 . since Novemeber 2003 , I have be contact Onkyo , by email & faxing , to have this system replace , and they have not respond to I . to I , a bad system and bad customer service mean a bad company . it be now April 2004 and I still have this break down system sit in the corner of my bedroom !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I live in a loft so I can not be run wire all over the place . this deliver great sound , the subwoofer give fine in depth detail without overpower the other speaker . there be many option available to tweak the sound as well as add other speaker if you want to make it a 5.1 system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	the good : it cost I $ 70 for a dvd\/receiver combo with six speaker . I never have any of the hum subwoofer , crackle , scroll video or any other obvious audio or video fault report on here . I have not have any serious trouble with the remote the bad : it do not play DTS . Dolby pro Logic II -lrb- from Gamecube and ps2 on av input -rrb- can be very iffy . sound seem to jump in and out of the rear speaker a lot . play with menu option usually result in a inexplicable loss of sound from some or all speaker . or sometimes it sound different when you set a option , then it sound even differenter when you try and set the option back to normal ! most setting be not remember if the unit be switch off and on again . if you rear speaker be too close to you -lrb- like i have in my apartment -rrb- , you must lower they individual volume every time the player be switch on . the remote be nice look , but spell all its word out -lrb- like `` play '' intead of -rrb- and `` stop '' instead of -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- you can not skip crappy dvd menu intro and other certain thing like you can on many other dvd player . conclusion : good price , but only get it if you really really can not afford a better dvd\/receiver combo , or better yet , separate component . note : to set the region on the player , go to setup with no disc insert , press right to get to pref page . then press 1,3,7,9 on the remote 's keypad . of course it do not save this , so you 'll need to change it every time you want to play a import dvd .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	nice home theater system . at a reasonable price , you get a complete home theater system with blu-ray player along with access to Netflix , Youtube , Pandora etc. . so far , I be loving it . Easy to setup . the sound quality be great even at loud volume . the bass be good too - shake my floor ! Netflix , Pandora , Youtube work well . easily connect to a external hard drive\/flash drive - can enjoy watch video , music , and photo through the portable media . the iPod doc work great too . I would say , for listen to music and watch movie in a apartment , this be a great find . the only feature miss be independent control over the bass . there be a sound effect call `` bass blast '' which can be select , but other than that no control over the range of frequencies\/volume of the bass individually .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	use they with my Sony cube speaker and they be PERFECT . I would not put anything larger on they .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	i get this system online at Walmart for $ 299 on sale this system be awesome sound great in a small room or medium room i would buy it again if i have to so far 4 day no light problem i guest vizio fix it good sound good base and good power i have a big yamaha system in my living room that be very powerful but this vizio be a great system and true 5.1 sound if you do not want to set up the rear speaker no problem but i like true surround sound i test it out by watch blade and matrix awesome you can hear every detail nice base dose not shake wall but sound very good you know you have base i do not work for amazon or walmart just want to tell people my experience with this system truth of the matter well worth $ 299 if you can get it you will not be disapoint
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	overall I be very pleased with the Panasonic sc-ht640w 5 dvd home Theater System . it sound great and be a great value for its price . it be extremely convenient not to have wire to the rear speaker . I do wish the rear volume be a bit louder , but again a minor problem for I . for those who have a wireless router -lrb- computer signal -rrb- you will likely get interference from the Panasonic Home Theater System . I do not have the spec on the home theater system , but it must also run on wireless Channel 6 , which be the same default signal for my wireless router . if this be you problem -lrb- drop wireless signal on computer -rrb- , you will need to reconfigure you wireless router to another channel . usually a wireless router have channel 1-11 . I set mine to channel 1 and now both system work fine .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	good system with a great sound quality . the cd\/dvd be flexible with regard to us\/european dvd format . altogether lot of feature , but along with that lot and lot of wire . Speaker wire be not long enough for a reasonably size room . to be able to properly use the system , read the manual . even obvious functionality be not necessarily easy to figure out without it . anyone figure out why you need 2 remote control for this combination ? consolidation would be nice , since other electronic gadget each have they own .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	this be a excellent entry-level system -- and you can not beat the price for the performance . if you want a solid 5.1 surround sound system for less than $ 200 , you will not find a better one than the Sony ht-ddw660 . my friend with a Onkyo super-system be amaze at the clarity and depth I get out of this simple Sony -- he say it be every bit as good as he $ 1,000 + system , albeit with fewer bell and whistle . I install this with my Panasonic HD tv and Hughes DirectTV\/TiVo HD receiver use a optical cable -lrb- which you must buy separately -rrb- , and the Sony system automatically switch to the optimal sound configuration on the fly . excellent for the rest of my family who do not want to fiddle with the remote . the digital coax connection make hook up a dvd a breeze , too . I recommend that you also buy the optional speaker stand -lrb- Sony ws-fv11 -rrb- which will cost you another $ 200 for two pair -- odd that four speaker stand cost as much as the actual system -- but they be worth it . my only -lrb- all minor -rrb- complaint be : - the power be a bit low -- you really have to crank it up to get some strong volume . if you have a big room for you home theater , get a bigger sound system than this . - beware switching to FM radio before turn the sound down ; for some reason , the volume level on the radio receiver be MUCH higher than for the tv\/surround sound , so you get blast if you just switch over withor readjust the volume -- weird . - wire into the subwoofer be permanent , unlike the connection for the other five speaker . not a big deal , but you 'll have to cut and splice if you want to use you own speaker cable . - optical cable should have be include . they give you a digital coax , but why not the optical cord ? - pay special attention to the part number on the back of the five speaker -- they determine the proper left\/right\/front \/ back placement -- I miss this when I first set up the system - I be have some trouble configure my Hughes TiVo remote to control the ht-ddw660 -- the recommend TiVo code do not work . Time to get a $ 200 universal remote , I guess ... as I say , all of these be minor complaint -- in general , I be extremely pleased with the sound quality . I keep have to remind myself that I spend less than $ 200 for this great system . highly recommend .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I buy the Visio 55 '' tv so instead of torture myself into overthink what be the best complimentary sound system I buy this one . it set up in a snap and I love it because it be wireless -lrb- kind of -rrb- . no wire be need to connect the subwoofer and sound bar . there be wire from the satellite to the subwoofer and from the Sound Bar to the tv but no big deal . the sound be great . I can hear dialogue without have to get subtitle . it be simple and efficient for someone who want good sound but do not want to spend more than 1\/2 the price of the tv on speaker .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	First of all , I would like to say I be not a audiophile . I use to install home theater as well as cable , so I be slightly more advanced than clueless when it come to a\/v . live in Florida , not many home be make to optimize a surround sound system . my home be very open , my living room have peak ceiling , and my entire house have a wood ceiling . I do not want to mess with the wood ceiling and put rear speaker in my home would not be feasible . but , the my stock tv speaker -lrb- along with all stock tv speaker -rrb- be terrible . I want to amp up my sound . know I be not go to have surround sound , and not want to throw down nearly $ 1,000 for a bose 3.2.1 system , I begin look at sound bar . I frequent best buy , HH Gregg , Sears , etc. check out the sound bar . many have wireless sub which I do like . other be setup so all the wire be go through the sound bar itself . again , I do not like that idea . I see this sound bar on the Daily Deal for $ 249.99 . after diving into review , there be two main complaint . First be the system do not produce true surround sound . to I , this should not be in any review . it be a sound bar . of course it do not produce true surround sound . the second complaint have something to do with run a 3d signal through the receiver which require a update that be hard to load . this do not pertain to I because my television nor any of my component be or ever will be 3d . so , I be sell on the review . I like the idea that this unit work have a receiver . all my component would run through the receiver just like any other receiver . I be skeptical about have the sub build into the receiver . I be not a huge fan of component be build into component -lrb- all-in-one htib - when one thing go , you lose everything -rrb- . I will update this review if I have any issue with it . I order the item on Monday with the normal free shipping . it arrive on Wednesday - that be gnarly . set up the system be very easy . it sound great . it 100 % do the job intend of better my tv speaker . movie , television , and video game be much more enjoyable . the music sound amazing . the remote look cheaply make , but it be a remote . the remote have a very simple design which be convenient for the technologically impaired . I be very pleased with this purchase . it sound great . I be stress the fact that I be not a audiophile and that this unit be only intend to compensate for my tv speaker . it go above and beyond what be expect . I hope this help !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I assemble it last night and figure where I want to put the speaker and what to do about the wiring etc. . it be early on but the assembly be simple and I be love the wireless rear speaker . the major part of my house be surround in rich music \/ movie \/ etc. . the coverage be absolutely amazing . as I say , it be early on but I be loving it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	many reviewer note the problem with the led go out but do not go into too much depth about the importance of the led , which make the decision to buy this product somewhat of a risk for I . therefore , I would like to focus my review on that aspect of the product . I have have my 510 for about 2 week now and have mostly love it . the led work flawlessly for I -lrb- so far -rrb- , but what be they really for ? what be the big deal with whether or not the light work ? okay ... there be 2 area of the light ; one area -lrb- on top -rrb- that tell you what `` audio mode '' you be in , and a second area that tell you volume and balance -lrb- whether bass be high\/low , whether the center channel be louder relative to the rear , etc -rrb- . the light on top tell you what signal you have . if you receive a dolby signal , the light on the leave -- directly underneath the DTS\/Dolby logo -- will come on and it will be blue . in the user manual , this light be refer to as be `` position 1 '' . if you receive a dt signal , the light under the DTS\/Dolby logo will be orange . if you do not receive a Dolby or DTS signal , that light just will not be on . I would imagine that if you do not have that light on , it would be annoying because you would not know -lrb- unless you have get the ear of a bat -rrb- for sure whether you be get a true hd signal . however , I do not have animalistic ear so I pretty much rely on that light to tell I whether I have get hd audio . the great thing about this setup though be that even without the Dolby\/DTS , the sound be fantastic . that be where sr come in , which basically simulate surround sound . you have 3 different version of SRS , each of which have very specific function . first there be sr truvolume , which be suppose to maintain consistent volume level when , for instance , change channel . you know how the volume for a tv show will be comfortable , but then the volume in the commercial blast you off the couch ? SRS TruVolume be suppose to prevent that . -lrb- for the record , I do not watch much tv and when I do I just use the tv speaker at a low level anyway , so I can not write on the efficiency of the TruVolume feature -rrb- . you 'll know if you have truvolume on when the Blue light come on right below the SRS logo -lrb- which Vizio refer to as `` position 3 '' -rrb- . next there be the SRS TruSurround feature , which will simulate a hd surround sound even if there be not a true hd audio source . here be what I love about this system , and why I probably would not care if the light fail . even though I do not have the most sensitive ear , I can tell a significant improvement in surround sound quality when the SRS TruSurround be turn on . you hit the SRS tshd button on you slide-out remote and you have get instant hd audio . if you light be work however , you 'll know you have this feature when the light in position 2 -lrb- in between the Dolby and SRS logo -rrb- turn blue . finally with sr , you have SRS WOW HD which be mainly for listen to music . currently I be listen to a fairly rock KT Tunstall track through these speaker and it sound like she be put on a show right in my house -- it be truly that clear . do a blind test -lrb- ie : if the light be not on -rrb- you can still figure out which setting -lrb- off , TruSurround , or WOW HD -rrb- be turn on . when off , the music sound flat . when Tru Surround be on , the music pretty much only come out of the front channel speaker and the instrument get drown out by the vocal . with WOW HD , it sound like a live concert setup ; it just sound natural be the best way I can describe it -- it be perfectly balance . the next set of light come from behind the soundbar foam -lrb- or whatever the technical term for the fabric that cover speaker be call -rrb- . if all volume and balance setting be factory default , you 'll have something that look like this : '' o -rrb- '' . if you turn up the volume , it 'll look like : '' o '' and so on and so forth . you can also adjust the bass , treble , sub , center , and rear channel . if you want more sound from the center channel , hit the right button and you 'll end up with something that look like : '' o '' . or if you want less from the center , '' o '' . when it be even , it 'll look like '' -lrb- o -rrb- '' . these light be probably more important than the orange and blue led because the change be much more subtle -- except for the volume level , which be quite noticeable . have these light work will let you know exactly where the level be . however , even with the light let I know where the level be , I still rely more on my own hearing to figure out where I want the sound to be . when I hit the up\/down button enough to where it sound good to I , I stop . the light indicator be nice and I hope mine do not quit , but it will not upset I too much if they fail . all in all , I be very impressed with the quality of these speaker . whether I be watch a blu-ray disc , a movie on Netflix or Amazon VOD , and whether I have a true-hd -lrb- Dolby or DTS -rrb- source , I feel like I be in the middle of the shot . everything sound crystal clear , from all speaker channel . the only negative about this setup be the lack of additional input . otherwise , it be nearly perfect .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this system continue to blow I away . it have all the power you could want , great sound satellite and a serious subwoofer . the reciever be a great quality piece . I have absolutely to quibble about with this system ; I think it sound as good if not better than system that be double the price . movie be amazing , and music sound great in the Direct , unprocessed mode .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I just buy this system after two year of major search . unfortunately , I should have wait another two year .  pro  can play almost any type of audio\/video disk Easy setup the main player look impressive  con  can not perform the most basic operation of my older , lesser Sony model ; include : can not change one disk while play another , and no shuffle mode ! -lrb- note to self ... never throw a party -rrb-  the sound be shallow , tinny , and weak . the listener be remind of a alarm clock radio . when in `` surround sound mode '' the listener be remind of several alarm clock radio .  the speaker be , in my opinion , very outlandish look . you 'll have difficulty incorporate they into any decor ; unless of course you live in a laboratory or industrial facility .  bottom-line  I would hold out on home theater for now . wait another two year for the high-end -lrb- $ 600 - $ 1000 -rrb- model to come down in price . also , power satellite speaker will be available within two year for a good price . that mean no more wire in you living room , so even the most unnatractive speaker can stay relatively hide .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	own a Samsung tv , we want a similar brand for the audio in order to take advantage of the smart link feature . although the player have very nice feature , the sound be disappointing for a HT System . the subwoofer be passive - not have a build in amplifier - and look and sound cheap . there be just few limited environment you can choose from the DSP option , but these be not able to sharpen the sound at a decent quality . you can definitively have a nicer sound from a pc surround system . the system have auto calibration feature , but the measurement get consistently wrong . if you have a room with hard surface -lrb- no carpet , bare wall -rrb- the processor get confuse by the reflection .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I have my unit for 1 month before experience the `` f61 '' many people have see . I call they repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 month and it seem that none of the part that Panasonic send they could fix the unit . to this date , I still can not get Panasonic to send I a refurbish unit . on top of that , I have to drive the unit 97 mile to the nearest repair shop . I would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it come to service the warranty .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	price and performance be what I want and get . I need something to replace my old break down speaker system . the crummy speaker on my tv would not cut it . setup be simple ; it be practically plug and play . I get what I expect . nothing fancy or blow you out of the room but good enough to get the job do . the room it be in be a fairly large odd shaped room but that do not seem to affect the performance at all . I would recommend this to anyone on a budget that just need to get actual sound from whatever you be watch or play .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I buy this system as a Christmas gift for my husband . I be embarrassed to even say I spend one cent on this so call dvd home Theatre System . can you return it ? I do not even see where you can return this item . we will be watch the a dvd and the volume will just go mute . it be very aggravating . if you turn the volume up past one you get blast ! I would not recommend this system .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this system rock ! I be the type a person who spend $ 299.00 on earphone to have the sound from from my stereo -lrb- htib -rrb- match what come out of my mp3 player , and because when it come to earphone , I believe you usually get what you pay for . in short , I be a audiophile . those who be complain about some hissing noise from the system likely do not have the speaker hook up correctly . the speaker must be connect exactly as outline or you will have sound problem . hook the speaker to my Yamaha system be not nearly as exact . my yamaha system sound wonderful , and I never think that a system make by LG could rival it when it come to sound . the LG sound better . I buy the LG because my hdtv be a LG , but the system be surpass my expectation both for tv and movie watching and for all other audio type .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I just get this system a month or two ago , and I be happy with it . the speaker be quite outstanding actually . I have everything run through a Sony receiver -lrb- the one that I have already review -rrb- along with some vintage Yamaha center speaker , and the setup sound quite nice so far . as everyone have already mention regard klh sound system , the speaker be amazing , and the subwoofer lack bass . then again , you do save a great deal of money on the sattellite system , so throw it towards a decent sub . the speaker come with everything require for mount , except decent wall screw . also , the include speaker wire be absolutely dreadful , I would recommend get you own separately .  this system be perfect for a apartment where you have to worry about neighbor above and below complain about constant wall thumping . I have have no complaint thus far . I do not mean to sell the sub short , it be nice for the price , and do not seem like its go to blowout any time soon . again , if you want to shake the painting off you neighbor wall , you might want to try something else .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be look at the bose 3-2-1 when I come upon this system . for the difference in price , I think `` what the heck '' . I be so glad I make this choice . the sound quality be outstanding and the look be amazing . we have a small condo and this be sufficient to listen to music throughout the entire place .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	love this thing sound quality be clear the base be strong I think it be go to be weak but I be wrong .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I be amaze how powerful this sound once it be hook up . the system be not top of the line by any means but for the price ... WOW ! I have have no issue with the product and my only compaint be that the power switch be a hard switch , mean that you cant use the remote to turn it on and off , only to mute it . other than this , product be excellent ! EDIT : two week later one of the imput have die completly . I now only have the front input and one in the back . this be very disapointing and I be afraid that the second one on the back could die soon . I do not crank it all the way to max volume or anything so I should not be have these kind of issue in 2 week . I be consider ship it back but that will end up cost I more than it be worth I would imagine . beware .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I could not use it to the fullest potential as I live in a apartment . I like it till now , I have flat screen tv never face any problem as they describe in other review for plasma tv 's . I like the look of it too , the tall boy speaker look great . I pay 410 $ and I be expect 50 $ back -lrb- 360 $ -rrb- . I feel it be worth the money . I rate it 5 star from experience .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this surround sound have great sound and be very easy to install , and consider the price versus one of the more expensive one with dvd or bluray player ... you be really better off with this one ! for starter most people already have one of these player or console in they home so to go through the expense of pay 300 to 500 and sometimes more be ridiculous ! for one you can just run the audio cord to you tv to get all extra sound for anything you have hook for it ... it be not necessary to buy the adapter for the hdmus cord ! why buy the adapter when you can , like I say , just run the cord to you tv . I love the sound it generate and it be a space saver ! I have a older model that be just too bulky and take up too much of what space I do have for it . . which trust I be very little . the only thing I would say I have prob with be the fact that the remote be so small and easy to loose !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	even thouth it say it be a receiver . it be not . you can not hook up you cable tv to it and use the speaker . you can only use the speaker if you play a dvd or listen to the tuner . it be not a true theater in a box as it say . I will be send it back .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I get this system about eight month ago and I have be very pleased with it . I do have a few complaint about it , however . my first complaint be the horrible remote , which never become intuitive no matter how much you use it . the chapter skip button and the fast forward button be one in the same . to fast forward you have to hold the chapter skip button for a few seconds . if you do not hold it long enough , you end up skip a chapter when you simply want to fast forward . the fast forwarding , however , be very good , allow up to 32x normal play speed . another complaint I have be the optical input . I have read that the sound lag behind the video , and I be dismayed to discover it be true . it can be very severe , like a couple of seconds . then I discover a way to correct it . all you have to do be pause and unpause the input source , and they will be synch . I test this by connect my ps2 and use it as a dvd player . the Samsung lose synch when start a movie or skip chapter , but after one pause and unpause of the ps2 , remain perfectly synchronize . another complaint I have be that the rear channel sound during Dolby ProLogic II surround playback be too low in volume . you can edit the sound , though , to increase the volume to the rear speaker , and the unit remember these value after it be turn off . I also find the Dolby Prologic II mode to be useless for anything but video game -lrb- which be what I use it for - and it be great -rrb- . it make music and tv sound like crap , so do not go out of you way to get Dolby Prologic II support if you do not intend to use it for gaming . even though I have some complaint about this system , I be still glad that I buy it , especially for the price that I pay ; however , a lot have change in the past eight month and many other player be offer similar feature in this price range . this player be good , but it be not so good that you would not want to seriously investigate other buy option .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	after about two year the player destroy a new dvd . the changer mess up and will not eject the other disk in the player . after it be take apart and the other disk remove my dad find that a small mod will make it a single disk player but still usable . still have great sound but only a single disk player .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy these speaker for my boyfriend 's birthday after much research . after read all the review I decide on these & I be glad I do : -rrb- very easy to set up , and the sound that come out of these speaker be very good . not incredible but much better than we tv speaker . we be get to the point of have to turn the tv all the way up just to hear the dialogue on some movie . well no more ! music sound really good too , can not wait for football season to see what these baby can do !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	Este teatro en casa proporciona muy buenas caracteristicas de sonido . Muy buen bajo . La configuracion e muy simple . El recibidor e un poco grande para mi gusto . Las entrada hdmus reproduccion el sonido con una calidad muy al incluso el sonido 3d . Para mi gusto e una de las mejores compras . .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy mine at Costco a few week ago for $ 300 and now it be on here for $ 270 ! buy one now . this be a great unit for the money . Easy setup , the speaker be not too large and it be nicely design with a lot of option . I be not go to go into all the detail because other reviewer have already cover they . I actually work in sound and I be really please with this unit . Sony be always quality stuff . there be more than enough power here for you . and I love that i can plug in my Iphone and play my itune - man , it sound terrific .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be very picky with my recommendation , but this system be one you can not beat for the price . I love the fact that you can get this without a dvd player , for those who already have one seperately . you 'll hear movie and music in a way you never have before . get ready to be blow away .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be a great system . sound from the speaker be incredible . have a Yamaha System before I pick this one up and it totally blow the Yamaha away . recently watch swordfish and some scene actually make my wall shake and the volume be not even at half . setup be simple ... do yourself a favor and get this system , you will not be sorry .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I really have high hope for this system . it have good review . the price be right . what could go wrong ? sadly , sound quality can go wrong apparently . I think it be quite possible that I receive a defective unit as the center channel do not produce any audio most of the time and when it do , it make voice sound completely muffle . on the upside , the sub in the unit sound great . it put out some rumble bass and I have to keep it turn down to `` 0 '' or '' +1 '' so as not to totally annoy the neighbor -lrb- love that apartment life -rrb- . I do not experience any of the setup issue that other people mention ; set-up be quick and easy . with all say and do however , I return the unit to Amazon today . pro : Easy set-up hdmus inputs\/output powerful sub con : Center channel sound muffle if it work at all
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I use it in my bedroom and the sound quaility be much better than the tv speaker , the output be not too lound as use in a bedroom , the only draw back be it have no hdmus input , so you can not connect any hdmus device to it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	HOW DO I get the surround sound to work with cable tv and not just the dvd . ALSO THANKS for the ipod hook up . jack
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I have have the KLH ha7000 for just about a year . I be in the middle of watch a dvd when the screen freeze . I have to take the system apart to get the dvd out and now it will not work at all . I turn it on and it say welcome . none of the other function work , so now I be stick with a almost $ 200 piece of junk ! do not buy this product , it be a piece of crap . I wish I have read other review before buy because the general consensus be , Crap .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I get it this thanks give . I be keen on get one and be wait for a decent deal . finally get it for $ 199 . a great price for this system . it take I less than a hour to set it all up . sound clarity be great ! I use it my living room -lrb- 15x25 foot -rrb- and it sound really nice . the only negative be that speakers\/woofer connect thro the dvd player which mean you can not use it while play tv\/cable\/vcr . but that could be easily fix - I have to get a audio-video cable -lrb- for 3 buck -rrb- to give my tv output to the dvd player and it work just fine . overall , a excellent home theater system !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have be spoil all my life with my parent THX home theater system and digital projector , and when I move out , although I didd not have enough money to afford $ 10,000 worth of equipment I still want a home theater setup . this apex unit catch my eye because of its feature set and low price - I be not expect much . suprisingly enough , this little puppy really perform ! that not to say that its a substitute for a full on home theater setup , but if you be on a tight budget and still want to watch you movie in 5.1 this be the way to go .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this system for my bedroom and it be unique from all the other `` home theater in a box '' system that I could find in that it have a component video input . I need this because my cable box support hdtv through component cable . the Samsung provide this feature with its `` digital in '' input selection and nicely pass through the component video throught its own component video output . I do not need or want the dvd changer but the lesser Samsung model leave out the component video input . I find use the changer a little bit of a hassle to insert and remove single dvd and it seem slower than use a single tray . the speaker be nice and small and that be what I be look for . the microphone to auto-balance the sound be a really nice feature and work well -lrb- it be all automatic -rrb- . I do not have any real opinion about the sound quality of the unit and speaker -- it seem fine to I but I be not good at evaluate sound quality beyond verify the 5.1 sound . the wireless rear speaker be a interesting gadget and do remove one set of wire from the unit to the rear . this really do not matter much to I -lrb- my unit be place against a side wall so run the wire across the floor be not horrible -rrb- . I do notice that there be some periodic interruption of the rear sound even within the small size of my bedroom . I rotate the receiver and it seem to make it go away during the sound test . I ultimately return this unit because it be incompatible with dvd-rw that I record from my Tivo in a different room . I be pretty surprise that such a new unit would have this incompatibility -lrb- I have see some older computer laptop have the same problem -rrb- . because of this , I have to attach a separate dvd player and this defeat the advantage of the small , all-in-one unit . I also could not take advantage of the component output of the dvd since there be only one component video input on the unit . since it do not upconvert composite video i also have to change the tv input when I switch between cable hdtv and play my dvd-rw . so for I it be just a lot of trouble . I give up on the idea of a combined unit and get a separate a\/v receiver with a separate 5.1 speaker set . more cable , more component to stack .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I expect this rca rt151 home Theatre System to crush my Durabrand HT-3917 Home theater system . and I be very disappointed . the RCA have 80-watt of power ! the Durabrand have only 40-watt . my durabrand be twice as loud ! ! ! and cost half as much ! ! ! rca be not the way to go . buy DURABRAND .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the title say it all ! this system be the perfect choice for a great movie experience while lay in bed . the quality of sound be superb and quite honestly I would have not expect the quality from a standard set up from Sony . this system could quite possibly be the basis for a `` e '' setup . my only gripe , which be the reason I give it 4 star vs. 5 , be that disc eject and disc swap take a unusually long amount of time . my old 5 disc carousel swap disc out quicker than this model . great package though ! do yourself a favor and skip the davc500 model and get this one !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I like how this soundbar look and be a very clean package . I have not have any led light issue and it work fine with my 64 inch samsung plasma , , , sound be very good , , bass and sub be respectable , , i love the no mess wireless sub and rear speaker , , , over all a great buy for the $ 250 i spend on it .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I be very disappointed with this system , my integrate tv speaker sound better than this system , needless to say I have return it . after read review and see the `` savings '' I think it would be a good buy . the biggest problem be the sound bar do not produce quality sound . it be a small cheap feeling bar , and it sound , well , small and cheap . the bar have no middle , and the result be no matter what the setting , I have difficulty understand dialog during movie . imagine hook up a subwoofer to you cell phone speaker . the integrate receiver and subwoofer seem like a good idea when I purchase . however , after set up and some use some problem with this setup become obvious to I . First be you have a component that will now vibrate . this mean it be recommend keep it isolate from device such as tv and dvd\/blueray player . the receiver be bigger than I expect so this become more of a issue than I expect . Second be that unless you have some odd home theater setup , the result of this integration be that you have a line of sight bass reflex port point at you . this make the bass unpleasant . instead of that bass fill the room feeling , it be come right at you from one place . I now understand why most subwoofer face down or towards the wall . I have a open floor plan room so I return think maybe my room be too big for a sound bar . however end up try a VIZIO soundbar with wireless subwoofer . the result be a great surprise . my room be not to big for a soundbar , this one just be not very good .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I read the negative review for Koss dvd player online , but I think I would give it a shot anyway , as Sears have a good deal over Christmas . well , the 90 day warranty run out a few week ago , and now the machine be nothing but a big silver paperweight . will not read ANY disk anymore . have not have a single problem till this , but on every review site , people describe similar experience . Ugh . I guess I deserve it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be completely happy with this purchase . it be simple to hook up ... even for a tech delinquent like I ! I do not realize how sad the speaker in my tv be until I get this . it be great for movie as well as music listening . good buy ... love it !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	after a lot of research I choose this sound bar and be very glad I do . the sound be superb for we `` bedroom theater '' and it make a huge difference to we view experience . it be not in the same league as we living room 's sound system of course -lrb- nearly $ 2k -rrb- , but we do not expect that . one thing that be very important to we be the clarity of speak voice -lrb- i.e. center channel -rrb- . we boomer-generation ear be not what they use to be . this unit have the clearest voice channel we have ever hear on any system . this be a huge plus to we , and it enable we to keep the volume at comfortable level while still hear the voice clearly . the system have plenty of volume -- way more than we would ever need in we bedroom . the subwoofer be more than adequate , especially for a bedroom . most other sound bar system require you to put the receiver\/subwoofer on the floor , which can make it difficult to see the display and operate with a remote . I like have it where I can see it -lrb- the display be dimmable , by the way -rrb- . as other reviewer have note , it do not emulate true surround sound , but it be a nice compromise in my opinion . the look of the system be fantastic . the bar be very sleek , and the subwoofer\/receiver look very cool in we furniture . -lrb- we have a dresser that have two audio compartment along the top shelf , and a 50-inch plasma -rrb- . before buy it , I have to convince my wife that it would make a real difference to we view experience , and she kind of roll she eye . finally she agree to let I buy it as a early birthday present for myself . well , guess what ! she like it even more than I do . she feel that it totally change we bedroom , not only for tv viewing but also music -lrb- cable digital music channel -rrb- . the great music sound actually lead to we watch somewhat less tv and listen to more music . not a bad thing ! if you be look for a high-end system for you living room , this one will not blow you away , and you probably should not be consider a sound bar anyway . but for a bedroom or secondary tv watch area or a modest living room set up , it be a great way to go .
Vacuum	POS	4	this vacuum , because it be cordless , only run for a few minute before the battery be out . not much of a problem for I , as my family mainly use this to vacuum the car once in a while , but could definitely be a problem for people who think this would be a compact solution to clean they home . I have yet to be disappoint with the suction power of this vacuum , and can get it into most of the nook and cranny in my car . I be guilty of snack as I drive , especially when stick in traffic , and I be also a bit of a messy eater so there be almost always crumb and rogue cracker in my car . I love use this to vacuum the floor of my car because of its compact size , and I can easily move it from the front seat to back .
Vacuum	POS	5	I purchase this item mainly for my car but this little vacuumed work great anywhere . the only thing it need be to add a charger for the car . I use the one I have for my car , it really have some great power for such a little vacuumed . it be great to clean up minor spill , cookie crumb , etc. . I also use it in the house to get down between the cushion to get crumb up . it have many use . it be small enough to put in a purse , camera bag , laptop case , etc. . it work great to clean in between the computer key and pick 's up dust very well . I would recommend this product to everyone and it also make a great gift for that person who you do not know what to get they . the price be good also . give yourself a treat and get one . you will not be dissatisfy with it . I do not work for the company or Amazon . Carolyn Salt Lake City , Ut .
Vacuum	POS	5	I just get a new car and I be a ocd clean freak etc. . it do a excellent job cleaning my car . this mini vacuum be the perfect size and very powerful . I have not find any con .
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy a Eureka vacuum as I have have my previous Eureka for 30 year . I have have other -lrb- Kenmore -rrb- as well during this period , and they all have problem . thus far , my new one have be terrific . I hope it continue .
Vacuum	POS	4	I love this little vac . it be easy to use and store out of the way . I use it on my stair , kitchen floor , and foyer . I be pleasantly surprise with the out come ; it be just what I be look for . the only downside for I be have to empty it . it be a little awkward have to hold it over the trash to empty while the lid try to close . I think if the lid stay open while be empty it would be much better . that con be very small in comparison to what you gain from this vac .
Vacuum	POS	5	I absolutely adore this little gem . besides be just as cute as can be , it be perfect for my small apartment . the charge last long enough for I to do what I need to and if it do get low I can plug it in and continue vacuuming . the cord be quite long and be perfect for those hard to reach place . I love mine !
Vacuum	POS	5	I order the Hoover brand type y replacement bag for my Hoover vacuum cleaner . they cost a little more than some generic type y bag , but I think it be worth it to buy the manufacturer 's bag to ensure a proper fit . the bag opening attach to the vacuum cleaner port and the bag have to have a immediate 90 degree bend to fit inside the enclosure . a previous bag not make by Hoover seem to fit poorly and some debris would collect inside the vacuum cleaner without reach the bag . since I have these Hoover bag , I have not experience that problem , so it seem to be worth a few cent more . shipment be very prompt .
Vacuum	NEU	3	great vacuum , really do a great job pick up the dirt , but it be a little heavy for the elderly . would recommend it for younger people .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be so glad I buy the Eureka 4870mz Boss Smart-Vac with the pet paw ! oh my goodness , it perform much better than my previous , much more expensive , vaccum ! it clean so incredibly well - great suction . and the powerpaw and hose be extremely powerful as well ! I have review vaccum for month before pick this one and boy do I ever make the right choice ! it be the same heaviness as any heavy-duty vaccum . I finally make a good-buy !!!
Vacuum	POS	5	read a number of review of different vacuum from various site . this one seem to have the right combination of quality and performance - even though the price be a bit higher than you average vacuum . we have not be disappoint . just unpack it you can immediately tell it be a quality product and well design . it be much more powerful than the Oreck upright we be replace - and amazingly quiet . it be also very easy to use and maneuver - the body easily `` twist '' to make tight turn , and also lay flat to get under bed , etc. . the attachment it come with be fine , but we do wind up also buy a `` parquet floor '' brush attachment , as we have a fair amount of hardwood floor . there be several similar model of this vacuum - all seem to have the same motor , just different `` auto feature '' , etc. . also this model come with a filter , but NOT a hepa filter . a new filter be include in each order of replacement bag . my understanding be that you can replace the `` standard '' filter w \/ a hepa if desire . I think on some of the more expensive model , the hepa come standard . the only slight negative , mention by several other , be that this vacuum be a bit heavier than we previous -lrb- and I assume than average vac -rrb- . this only come into play when carry it around - not in operation . we do not find it a problem at all for we usage , and we have three level to deal with . just want to include that comment in case it be a issue for other . overall a excellent vacuum that I believe will serve we very well for many year . definitely a case of you get what you pay for - imo it be well worth it .
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy this after get feed up with empty my canister vacuum and suck dust , and who know what else , each time . I just could not quantify spending as much money as I do only to inhale everything I would just clean out of my house . the end result be that I vacuum less when the canister begin to get on the full side because I hate the idea of have to empty it . so that be why I buy it in the first place . as soon as I take it out of the box I be pretty thrill with the purchase . all of the accessory attach to the unit securely and I have not have a single piece pop off on it be own even when lug it up stair , down stair , and put it in the back of my car . at the same time they be easy to put on and take off when you want . the only slight exception may be the power paw and the ` wide ' attachment for the hose . I have not have any problem with they but I can see how they might cause problem . the power paw be the least securely attach and the wide attachment be the most securely attach and slightly cover by the cord when wind up . pro : where do I start ? 1 -rrb- it be powerful . this be easily one of the most powerful vacuum I have ever use . it suck the litter right out of my litter-catcher-rug that I have in front of we cat box . I use to have to shake the rug out and vacuum the litter off the tile , but now I just pop on the wide attachment for the hose and go to town . 2 -rrb- it have as all the most practical attachment include plus the power paw . this pro be just about standard . all vacuum should come with the primary attachment and this one do and they throw in the power paw which be really great for stair ... just like they advertise it to be . as for the power paw , it rotate via suction . I have a bagless with this attachment and it would lose suction so quickly -lrb- pet hair in the filter -rrb- that this attachment be useless . on this vacuum the power paw be like a freak chainsaw no matter how much hair it suck up . 3 -rrb- it be easy and fast to switch from floor to hose setting and back again . I can literally go from vacuum the floor to use the hose in 5 seconds or less and I can go from vacuum the floor to use the hose with any attachment + the extension in 10 seconds or less and it only take very slightly longer to put it all back and continue vacuum the floor . go be the day for I that I do all my floor vacuum and then follow up with the hose . now I can do everything in one pass . 4 -rrb- the floor brush can be engaged\/disengaged with the flick of a switch for easy transition from carpet to bare floor . this be the first vacuum I have own that I can do this on and I will never go back ! vacuum bare floor while the brush be spin be like ... well ... it just do not work . all it do be turn everything on the floor into tiny projectile that be launch at my foot and shin . be able to turn off the brush ... it be one of those , `` finally ! '' moment for I . what I mean be , I can finally just use the vacuum on my bare floor instead of the vacuum\/broom combo . I use to sweep the bare floor up then follow up with the vacuum to get all the corner the the broom could not clear . now , because of this feature and # 3 , just the vacuum , easy peasy . 5 -rrb- it have a hepa filter that be easy to access for removal and installation . I have not have to replace it yet but I do open it up and remove it and install it just to see what it be like . Super easy . 6 -rrb- it have a light on the base for dark corner . this be good for unlit or not-well-lit area of the room . personally , I have find this more of a novelty than something I would require in a future vacuum purchase . 7 -rrb- the bag be easy to remove and install . again , this be just about standard . the last bagged vacuum I have be a soft top -lrb- the bag be inside of a zippered bag -rrb- so it be ridiculous to get the bag out and put it back it . it be the vacuum that put I off bagged vacuum . I go to canister and do not go back until now ... over a decade later . 8 -rrb- wide track . this be just a convenient feature . wider track = less pass . I have not , as of yet , have any situation where it be too wide to fit somewhere I need it to . 9 -rrb- it be a bagged vacuum . like I say on # 7 , I have be use bagless\/canister vacuum for over a decade now . I finally get so feed up with the dust cloud when empty they and tap out the filter so I would not have to spend another $ 20 so soon . I even make a special tool so that I could attach my filter to my drill and spin the dust that be pack so tightly in there out with centrifugal force . this , obviously , just make the dust cloud during canister empty worse but if I want the vacuum to have any suction it be necessary . even then , I would lose suction steadily as I suck up the cat hair . since I do not feel like dish out $ 300 - $ 600 for a canister vacuum that `` never lose suction '' yet still deal with the cloud of nasty when I empty the canister I buy this bagged vacuum . there be still the bit of dust that poof up when you detach the bag from the vacuum and there be a possibility of dust that puff out if you compress the bag but nowhere near the amount of a canister . if you be careful , there be no dust cloud at all , which be freak awesome . no more dust mask and goggles for I while empty canister ! 10 -rrb- last minute addition after write in my con . there be a second handle low on the vacuum for carry up stair . it make it so much easier to handle ... no pun intend . con : 1 -rrb- it be loud , as with every other vacuum I have ever own . not really a true con as all vacuum be loud but it be still advisory to wear hearing protection when use it . 2 -rrb- it be kind of heavy . this be not a con for I but my wife have some trouble with it when it come to stair . 3 -rrb- the handle be not as comfortable as it could be . although not entirely uncomfortable it be not as nice as some of they other model . 4 -rrb- the light on the base be not quite as bright as it could be . at first I think that it would be a really great feature but it be not quite bright enough to make a significant difference in visibility in my opinion . they could have put a much brighter system in here quite easily . Hope this help you with you decision !
Vacuum	NEU	3	it be not a bad vacuum for the price but I would not recommend anyone pay more than $ 79.00 . the hand attachment be actually pretty cool and work well on `` dog hair in the couch '' problem . I be really disappoint with the edge suction -- they be wrong to say there even be such a thing . I end up do all the edge task by hand -lrb- or broom -rrb- .
Vacuum	POS	5	I purchase a previous version of the 4870 -lrb- dark green -rrb- a couple of year ago . the newer model have only minor difference . note to dad and husband : think of it as a power tool ! I will echo the other comment on great suction and somewhat heavy weight . this be a excellent combination of power and price , but you may want to think twice if you be a smaller person who would need to carry the cleaner up and down stair a lot . I have laminate floor so the brush control be mandatory ; that feature be hard to find on other model in this price range . so far I have have two year of good service with no problem . the control for the brush and the hose suction could be more intuitive but I get use to they quickly . from other review , apparently people have have trouble with the bare floor toggle . in my experience , if you try to set the toggle before you unlock the handle , the toggle will fall back to the carpet setting and the carpet brush will keep turn ... which negate the whole point of the toggle . however , mine work fine if you set the rotary height adjustment knob to `` bare floor '' and then use the foot pedal to unlock the handle . at this point you can easily move the toggle from `` carpet '' to `` bare floor '' and it will click into place , stop the brush . yes , it be more hassle than it need to be but rapidly become second nature , and the cleaner do a grear job on my laminate floor .
Vacuum	POS	5	I purchase this as a gift for my daughter . she have 2 dog and 2 child and she be very happy with its performance .
Vacuum	NEU	3	just think I would let you know the vacuum be worth $ 200.00 do not pay any more then that , it be make in the U.S.A. which be its strongest selling point . the second be that it really suck and work great , but there be absolutely , no extra or any whistle as per say , so if you just need a good vacuum cleaner , this be it . remember you can purchase it easy for $ 200. , on line , this be a commercial vacuum cleaner , so do not pay any more then $ 200. , this be a super light and easy vacuum cleaner , but it be all plastic and light . some people say it be loud , it be but it work good , maybe even great .
Vacuum	POS	5	I receive this vacuum a couple of week ago . it really work well . I have ceramic tiling thoughout the house except the bedroom . it work on both surface well . initially I find it hard to push , but with time I find it be a lot easier . I be most happy with this vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	5	Works well ... have 5 dog , have back surgery , fill in the gap nicely between maid visit ... get the correct replacement filter
Vacuum	NEG	2	it start out well but putter out after only a year . it be cheap but you would have to buy a new one yearly . that be a waist of resource and I hate the `` make it cheap and make it not last '' business practice . I replace the bag regularly , replace the filter but it just have poor pick-up and that be the whole point of a vacuum . when you have to run over the thing you can see 3-4 time to get it , how many thing that can not be see be be leave every time you vacuum ?! this replace a Dyson -lrb- that last year ! -rrb- and will be replace by a Dyson .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this thing be wonderful for the first three year . I recall tell my wife when I first fire it up , `` we can actually have a conversation with this thing run '' . my only immediate complaint be that it do not do the greatest job with edge cleaning . otherwise , it be not be a bad vacuum consider it be be use daily for over 2,700 day straight -lrb- 5 child to clean after -rrb- . over-all : good suction , handle well , change only 3-4 belt , contain dirt very well with hepa filter , change lightbulb only once . here 's my experience with quality issue -lrb- heavy use , but not abuse -rrb- : year 1 : no problem year 2 : auto brush stop fail when vacuum be upright , but can still manually stop with lever . notice that it be not as quiet as at first -lrb- rattle and buzz -rrb- . year 3 : replace hose attachment due to nozzle end chip and crack . Flex hose leak . year 4 : replaced lightbulb . notice powercord insullation easily become chew if accidently run over cord . year 5 : quite loud now , but no noticable performance difference since new . year 6 : will not stay upright unless you adjust the yellow release pedal to lock in . there be be a few `` ouch '' with my wife and kid . year 7 : Power switch no longer work , the belt tension arm have weaken and the roller brush just ramp up and down -lrb- even with a new belt -rrb- . hose and nozzle need to be replace again , powercord and the roller brush should be replace ... time for a new vacuum . be the above acceptable for a $ 160 vacuum ? I guess , but quite frankly , I would be willing to spend a few more buck on a vacuum that get I out to 10yr and have better quality in plastic part and do not get louder with time and give I better edge suction . if it mean alot more money , this vacuum be probably hit the sweet spot . I consider give this 4 star , but decide on 3 as I be not really sure if it be above average with regard to wear and tear for this price point . I hope this help you buying decision .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I spend a lot of time research vacuum and decide that we would buy this . I purchase it about 4 month ago . I realize that if I have purchase a $ 400 vacuum I probably would not have these issue , but we can not afford that . this vacuum do as all do and vacumm up the everyday dirt , but there be some issue I want to make sure other buyer be aware of prior to they purchase this product . the only good thing I have notice be that the one attachment -lrb- not the Pet -rrb- work great on pet hair . better than my old Dirt Devil . if you do not mind my frustration outline below , then you will be happy with you purchase . my issue : 1 . the filter be horrible to clean and unless you clean they there be no suction . you have to clean two area and one do not remove from the vacuum so be almost impossible to clean . the filter itself be make of two section , a foam outer section and the inner filter . the only way to get it really clean be to wash it which be what the instruction say to do after every use . -lrb- which in itself be a pain . I have decide that it work fine to do every other time or so . -rrb- the issue be it take forever for the inner filter to dry . so make sure you have vacuum everything you need to prior to wash otherwise you can not use you vacuum with a wet filter . this happen to I , I realize I miss a large area and have to wait to vacuum it , and it make I really mad . 2 . if you be buy this for the PET ATTACHMENT , do not . I try to use it and the attachment lock up and will not spin . have be unable to remedy and the tool be useless . 3 . my old vacuum have a way to shut off spin brush when use the hand attachment and I miss that . every time I use the hand tool I have to angle the vacuum so that it do not ruin my carpet . 4 . the HAND ATTACHMENT hose do not go very far at all . you have to keep the machine close to where ever you be use it . like I say earilier , it work well for the price , but just be aware of the frustration to use it . if you do clean the filter properly it do have decent suction and work well . happy Shopping !
Vacuum	POS	5	we have be use the Miele brand bag for several year but as the price continue to increase and the quantity in the box decrease decide to give these bag a try . we be very pleased ; the bag itself be good quality , the collar be cardboard instead of plastic . Update 2012 : the most recent shipment be not the EnviroCare brand , even though that be what the photo show , but DVC brand . the bag state it come with 2 different filter but none be inside . the EnviroCare brand seem to be of slightly higher quality .
Vacuum	POS	5	this product vacuum and pick up quite well . it be somewhat heavy , but heavy be good because hold to the floor , et al. . my wife delegate I to operate this . fold-up to store , clean : require a little dexterity , and in clean out the accumulate , it be best hold over a waste basket . there be two filter , which should be `` service '' . filter keep air clean . pleased with the purchase , the vacuum be solid in consturction . it be good value , engineer well . .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be very pleased with this product . it be powerful , easy to maneuver , and empty be a breeze . be able to clean the filter save on cost . I highly recommend this vacuum if you want convenience and power .
Vacuum	POS	5	receive the Hoover on time . price be very fair . the vacuum have work perfectly since it arrive . we use it for stair and hardword floor and dust . also useful for we car . it take a little get use to use since it have no wheel and you carry it . however it be light weight make the carry very easy . you can get to almost anywhere you need to because of the extra long cord . the cord length be a real plus . the vacuum be strong and the attachment work very well . the Portapower be well make and use good attachment . I would purchase the vacuum again .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have get generic vac bag before and they be just paper . Fine . I be not that particular and the Miele bag be so expensive . I order these figure they be just paper but they be the `` cloth '' type just like the OEM . very pleased .
Vacuum	POS	5	this product really do the job . good vacuum and versitile as far as rug type and floor to vacuum . look to be durable and be easy to handle .
Vacuum	POS	5	I struggle with whether to give this unit 4 or 5 star . I be lean toward 4 because I find the hose incredibly awkward because it want to stick out prominently to the side while vacuum . this cause I to sweep a very special coffee mug off which shatter on the floor . I try to pay more attention but end up catch another glass shortly thereafter . you really have to be careful when you be use this thing because the hose extend about 2 foot to you side and will hook anything in its way such as lamp , glass , painting , etc. . at the end of the day i decide to give it 5 star because it truly be a magnificent vacuum . it do exactly what it be suppose to do . it be a light weight vacuum with tremendous suction and a long power cord . I will take responsibility for the learning curve and not penalize the device . I want to mention one other thing in relation to the weight . I have read that it be heavy . I be a fairly large guy so I wonder whether other people might find it uncomfortable . my 9 year old son follow I around the house when I first get the unit , beg for a chance to try it . I eventually give in and he use it for 15-20 minute and never once complain about the weight . he be only 75 lb , so if he can wield it , I think most adult would be able to do so comfortably .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I check out this vaccuum on consumer report which be the reason I buy it . well , to my disappointment it be the WORST vaccuum I have ever own . not only be it clumsy to use with the hose continuously fall off , but it burn my carpet whenever I use the hose . I do NOT lean on it or push it forward as it warn on page 7 of the warranty ; the vaccuum would singe the carpet just sit upright even after 10 seconds of use the hose . what a extremely poorly engineer vaccuum . what I be really surprised about be even if someone be to barely lean on it , a vaccuum should never burn you carpet . how can they even put this product on the market ?!!!
Vacuum	POS	5	this product be the best we have find for what its make for . we live in a Motor home and its the best for a quick clean and it clean very well . BUT , you have to follow the direction . to clean sweeper after each use , dump cup , and keep the filter clean ! if you let it charge for 18 hour before use , we vacuum we whole 40 foot motor home on one charge .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be sick and tired of the bagless , the mess , dust and use my air compresser to blow out all part of my Dyson canister . I really think this eureka out clean and be cleaner all around for a fraction of the cost .
Vacuum	POS	4	the vacuum do exactly what I want it to do . it be portable , and the hose feature be perfect for I . however , the vacuum be a bit noisey . other than the noise , I really like the product a lot . I would recommend it to anyone that be not concern about the noise .
Vacuum	POS	5	I use it on all flooring surface in my home . buy it to replace a dirt devil cordless vacuum , this be by far a better vac .
Vacuum	POS	4	I love this vacuum , however , it be too heavy and bulky for my 2 story house . pro : twist feature be great , easy to unpack and set up , super long cord , great suction , beautiful to look at . con : Heavy & bulky . could not vacuum the stair with it at all . do not seem to work very well on ceramic floor -lrb- would not vacuum up the paper clip I sprinkle on the floor -rrb- . best use : one story house with lot of carpet , otherwise consider a Miele canister vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	until someone can email I at cloudninesterling@hotmail.com or reply to this comment and tell I how they could rate this anything over a `` I hate it '' , I refuse to believe other be rate the correct product . I have have this vacuum for a year and have re-try it about a dozen time . no matter what setting I put it on -lrb- from bare floor up to high carpet -rrb- it simply do not pick up debris from the few carpet I have in my home . this vacuum do not work . I throw mine in the dumpster today . Mary Jennifer Pruim Age 43 Chicago , il
Vacuum	POS	5	i be search for a replacement for my kenmore cannister that lose its ooomph . after research consumer report i be just about set to buy the eureka 8340 series which be one of the top rate . after further research i find waay too many negative review in term of reliability and quality . make I wonder how this unit be top rate in the first place . one of the review mention the carpet pro series . it be supposedly make by the same folk as simplicity and ricarr . i have access to the simplicity upright and love it . after search the internet i find the best deal at allbrand direct . for $ 250 no shipping chg , they include 3 belt , 2 filter ,7 pc accesory set-15ft hose - bare floor , upholstery , ceiling , crevice tool and 2 extension . this be a great deal especially since i have stair to do . as for the unit itself = i buy the cpu-2t - 40ft heavy duty cord and 3 attachment - since i get sloppy and tend to run over the cord once in a while i think it be best to get this model - the 1t model have a light ,30 ft 2prong cord and no attachment . i have several pet - 3 cat and 2 dog and hair hair hair . i purposely leave one of my carpet alone until i get this unit . Dont let the 10amp motor turn you off - as soon as i plug this in and turn it on , it practically drag I across the room - its not self propel but the brush be so good it literally will feel like its pull you . basically in 1-2 pass the room be clean in 3 minute app 10x12 . no effort be need to push and pull it . it be 18 lb and i have no problem carry it up the stair where it quickly dispose on loose kitty litter . it also have its own build in resettable fuse if the unit overheat due to clog or full bag . although there be no bad full indicator , from past experience you ; ll know the bag be full when you look at the carpet . I be totally please with this unit . its not overly loud in my opinion . forget all those bargain deal and buy this unit . this might be you last vacuum purchase , even though other unit be 15 inch , you 'll make it up with speed .
Vacuum	POS	4	this vacuum work much better than we last bagless vacuum . it do clean the floor well , bare and carpet . the con be that be very heavy and the hose be short . to vacuum my step I have to do half with the vacuum at the top of the step and half from the bottom .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have allergy to just about everything , paticularly dust . I have switch my upright to the Oreck use the hypoallergenic bag . the upright I use originally seem to be do the job , however , ten minute after vacuumm I notice dust particle settle on the furniture and everywhere else . shortly thereafter I have a migraine . since I switch to the Oreck , I no longer have to dust everything after vacuumm and have reduce my allergy symptom significantly . the Oreck contain the dust particle in the hypoallergenic bag , be light weight and flexible enough to vaccum in tight area . love it , love it , love it !!!
Vacuum	POS	5	these bag be hard to find and really expensive most place , save a lot of money and time purchase online .
Vacuum	POS	4	it be compact , easy to clean out , and handy . not terribly impressive on either wood floor or carpet , but for the price , it be gist fine . I have a tough time clean the hair -lrb- we have longish stuff in we home -rrb- out of the roller bar . interesting idea : wash the filter clean after dump out the stuff collect - very green . not sure how long it 'll last . a relative have have one for a couple of year and be ready to move on to a more substantial and dependable vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	4	heavier than I expect and feel a little blockish to move around at first , but very nicely lowers\/rolls down step . love the attachment - especially the power paw with the brush inside . Works very well for the stair . great suction . take a little bit to get use to the setting . price be great . reliable manufacturer .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I be so po would I waste $ 57 on this . I buy this to dust around the comp. , phone , printer , etc. on the desk and because it get a 4 star rating on 85 hit . let that be a lesson . I agree with the bad review . short run time , long charge time , plus ergonomically awkward to use . I put a shoulder strap on it -lrb- need a hand free to move stuff -rrb- and a better brush head but the short run time -lrb- 5 min ? -rrb- and long charge time -lrb- every time , not just the first time -rrb- still make it a bust . build quality seem good so maybe it 'll work for someone with different need than I . in they defense , I have a B&D; Dustbuster floor vac that I love and run 4 time longer even with the powerhead go .
Vacuum	POS	5	great product , and work really well both on carpet and wood\/concrete . also work very effectively on animal hair -lrb- cat & dog -rrb- . even use it to vacuum off the couch and bedding -lrb- both victim of say animal -rrb- .
Vacuum	NEU	3	Have have two of these in the last 5 year . Consumer Reports recommend and work well out of the box . however , the beater bar motor be too weak to continue work over time . Have have both get progessively weaker and finally just stop work . I do not have pet , just short carpet . attachment do not stay on and quite heavy . hepa filter be good though . tired of buy disposable vacuum . will try a Miele with 7 year motor warranty and go back to canister vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have own this same unit for more than 7 year with 2 household use it weekly and the motor go out just in Feb. 2011 . lucky for I I be able to find the same model on Amazom.com so I jump on it asap . head up this be not the most quite of unit . Lady Lee
Vacuum	NEU	3	good suction on either carpet or bare floor but it be very loud . also , it be impractical to fold\/unfold to connect to the power base .
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy this vac last week . I charge it up a couple of time and use it to pick up cat litter , cat hair off a rug\/furniture , people hair , etc. . it work great . it make vacuum fun . I like how the caddy be attach to the vacuum and carry the tool with it .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I love this vacuum when I get it and even talk my daughter into one . great suction . but after about 4 month the battery start to give out . contact the company and they say I could not purchase a battery as I should not open vacuum . they send I a brand new vacuum cleaner instead which I think be very nice . same thing be happen again . I can barely make it across the kitchen floor without it die . I guess it be time to give on up this one .
Vacuum	POS	5	WE get this sweeper at Kmart for $ 79.99 last year . it be a extra one we use downstairs in laundry room and basement . it be a very good sweeper for the money . in fact I like the extension hose much better then we Dyson animal which be very hard to use with the beater attachment . we lend it to we son and daughter in law to use while they be pack up and move . they be very impressed with the suction it have . we tell they to keep it and I be order another one today from Amazon . Free shipping and a 10.00 rebate . who can beat that ? do wish it have a longer cord and the beater brush turn off while you be use the beater extension on stair -lrb- it will burn you carpet if set on the low setting so watch that -rrb- but i still think it be a great sweeper for the money .
Vacuum	POS	5	we spend a long time research vacuum before decide on the relatively unknown Carpet pro . despite the lack of consumer review , we choose it over several Hoover model in we price range because we question they durability -lrb- we be so tired of buy a vacuum and have it die month in to own it ! -rrb- . all we want be a basic vacuum , nothing fancy , that would hopefully last for many year . I think we have find it in we Carpet pro . it have amazingly strong suction , be actually pretty quiet , and we be almost five month in and have not fill up the first bag yet ! I be puzzle by the negative review on its performance off carpet - why would you buy this type of cleaner to use on wood\/tile ? maybe I be old fashion , but I sweep my tile floor and just vacuum the rug ! anyway , it be a terrific vacuum , a rarity in this price point . con ? well , it be big and yellow , but it be a vacuum , not a piece of art , so who care ? also , the suction be so strong , I can not really use it on my smaller throw rug , so I have to shake they outside or onto a larger carpet .
Vacuum	POS	4	I think when I buy this , it would clean cheaply and would not work well ... I be wrong , it be pretty good . not lie at all , I like it ! I can tell you it be no be near be as good as a roomba , but it be not that bad . it clean BEST on hardwood floor -lrb- because it only have suction , not brush or anything like that -rrb- . so if you have a all carpet floor house do not get this product . but if you have hard wood floor this be a good product for the price . why ? because it have a thing on the bottom that you can but a rag cleaning sheet so it would be like sweeping too . it go for about 50 min and need to charge for about ... 12 hour ... yeah I know , that be LONGGG time , but if you do it overnight , -lrb- 9 hour -rrb- it clean for a long time . so now when you turn it on , it start right away . you have to watch it because sometimes it do get stick on uneven flooring , a mat , or rug . I like this product alot because it be so quiet ! I mean for a vacuum it be super quiet . overall I like it and plan on keep it ! : - -rrb-
Vacuum	POS	4	- very good item for the price ! Works great for a hand hold item ! also great that you do not have to worry about the battery die cuz it run off you cigarette lighter ! great product !!!
Vacuum	NEU	3	I notice the other two review before I mention serious problem with they 4870sz so I think it worthwhile to add my experience . the first one that arrive just do not work . do not pick up dirt . call Eureka customer service and they could not figure out the problem so they tell I to bring it to a authorized service center . that seem pretty ridiculous to I -lrb- I should not have to drag it around to get repair when I buy it new and allegedly work ! -rrb- and I tell the service agent that . then she tell I I also have the option to return it to Amazon . so I ship the big heavy thing back to Amazon for a exchange . Amazon be great because they pay for the return shipping and within two day I have the replacement vac . well this one seem to work pretty well . the only weird thing be that when I first turn it on it seem to move forward on its on like a self propel lawnmower -lrb- which be nice ! -rrb- but within a few minute it become much harder to push . I have not have a chance to call customer service again and ask they if it be suppose to be like that or not . speak of Eureka customer service the woman who I have on the phone seem to know less about the vac than I do after read the direction only once ! that be disconcert . anyway my bottom line be it seem to work fine now for I but you might want to do some more research first . and thanks to Amazon for make the exchange so easy and painless !
Vacuum	POS	5	I have Fibromyalgia and have be look for a light weight cordless vacuum . this hold the charge long enough to do my whole house . I have 3 dog and it handle the dog hair , too ! someone write that it be difficult to empty , but I have no problem do that at all . I now have 4 other cordless vacuum wait to go in my yard sale ! this one be great !
Vacuum	POS	5	I love this little Flex Vac . it be so easy to carry and operate . I really like the easy empty side door and not have to purchase new filter . it easily come apart for cleaning . I have a huge lady bug issue in my home and this little vac be awesome for suck those little critter up . for you folk that have issue with kill they they be still alive when I empty it out outside . I do not have the chargeing issue other folk be c\/o . I can vaccum a whole flight of stair with it .
Vacuum	POS	5	leave it to german engineering ! they sure get this one right . I be really hesitant to spend this much on a vacuum but if this Miele s7210 last at least several year I will be satisfy . it be very quiet compare to the Hoovers and Electrolux that I have use and purchase in the past . I like the swivel\/rotating head design , be not originally sure about that . the layout of the accessory and design of the hose be very convenient . it have do great on we short pile wool rug , tile and hardwood -lrb- with brush head off -rrb- and the small rug in we kitchen . I run over the cord once and it shut itself off to avoid damaging anything when the brush head get jam ! now if I can only teach it to pick-up the kid toy , floor cleaning would be cake ! I will try to update this review next year to make sure it be still hold up well .
Vacuum	POS	5	my carpet be old but have finally get to the point where it be stain so badly , no matter how many time I clean it , the stain keep come back , not matter what I try , and I try everything ! as a final last desperate act , I look for a vacuum on Amazon , and after read all the rave review on this one , I buy it -- and it work ! after vacuum my carpet with this vacuum , I be finally able to get they clean with my steam cleaner . I guess my old vacuum be so feeble that it be leave so much dirt in the carpet that the cleaner just could not do it be job efficiently -- I think with all that dirt in there -lrb- I have three huge dog who live in the house , but love play in the dirt and mud -rrb- try to clean it be just make the stain worse . now my carpet be finally clean again and I be have to steam clean they only rarely , because this vacuum get pretty much everything up to the point where I do not have to clean it so often ! I be on the point of rip my carpet out and buy new carpet , so this vacuum be well worth the price -- it give my carpet a few more year lease on life !
Vacuum	POS	4	purchase to do minor cleanup on my model train layout . previously have a battery operate similiar product about same size . this do the same job without the battery expense . I try the keyboard cleaning and yes it do make that chore a lot easier . with the brush attachment it dislodge the dirt between the key to be suck up by the vacuum . then try the dust that accumulate around the monitor screen edge and corner which also woke well . good for crumb and other food item spill on yout desk also . a good value for minor cleanup .
Vacuum	NEG	1	pro : - good suction - the hepa filter be nice although I do not know how to gauge the effectiveness of it - Easy to switch between floor and hose suction - can turn off the brush when do bare floor con : - heavy - attachment fall off while vacuum - not easy to assemble the attachment - the handle release foot switch mechanism be a bent piece of metal house in fragile plastic which break after a few month . unfortunately that plastic housing be all part of the base of the vacuum so you have to replace the whole bottom of the vacuum . - since I forget to call Eureka within the first year of purchase I be tell I would have to pay for the replacement part even though I tell they it break within the first three month . I ask to speak to a manager and be tell none be available and one would could call I back which never happen . I think the part be around $ 30 with shipping which be a substantial amount compare to the cost of the vacuum . I could not bring myself to pay for the part so we live with a vacuum that fall over which make I angry every time I have to vacuum ! so since Eureka make a fatally flaw vacuum and will not support it or create a replacement part that fix the flaw I will never buy a product from they again .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be expect it to be kind of worthless . but at worst I know the swiffer pad would sweep like the Mint but a lot cheaper because this one do not have that fancy navigation . on we hard wood floor it suck up dust , sand -lrb- volleyball court : -rrb- -rrb- , and cat hair efficiently -lrb- but skip the cat toy and ribbon -rrb- . in we 1250 sq. foot apartment it travel everywhere , get the little bit of cat litter outside the litterbox , and the dust bunny from under the chair and couch . definitely worth $ 44 . do not compare it to a $ 600 Roomba . I be a computer engineer , and I can not wait to add all of the high price feature to this one on the cheap ! if all go well I 'll write a blog and how-to about it ! I plan on replace the mcu\/software with open source code , give it a charge base station and scheduler , extend the run time , speed up charge time .
Vacuum	POS	4	I really like this vacuum . it be easy to assemble , very light , and pick up every inch of dog hair . my other vacuum stop work properly and the first time I use this , it fill both bin with dirt . we be allergy sufferer so I wash the filter after each use ... which be a pain . I do not realize I have to do this before I purchase it or I would have re-considered but I really do like it . I sweep off my furniture and it pick up dirt on the carpet really well too .
Vacuum	POS	5	girlfriend and I decide to replace a old hoover bag vacuum with this one . we go through all of we option include the dyson and other more expensive model . after read all of the positive review on this vacuum we decide why not give it a try and save some cash . glad we do because this vacuum suck ! ok it actually be completely rock , and we be 100 % happy with we vacuum and amazon fast delivery and no sale tax .
Vacuum	POS	5	powerful cleaning action . strong vacuum suction , rotate brush be very effective . couple with hepa -lrb- type a -rrb- bag from Riccar , the unit really help to capture dust . carpet be visibly cleaner . Brush action help to pull the unit forward on carpet . unit do a good job pick up against baseboard . pick up everything in its way . no frill that be really unneeded for my application -- cleaning carpet . 40 ' cord be helpful in long hallway and big room . compare very well against unit that cost over twice as much . I use this one in a commercial application , and will probably buy the permutation with the headlight and 30 ' cord for home .
Vacuum	POS	5	great vacuum , this be the second one i have buy and for the money there be nun better . just keep the filter clean . my first one be five year old and still work fine , use it for the rent house now . my new one work great and i be very happy with it .
Vacuum	POS	4	to keep my floor food free -lrb- no crumb for the mouse -rrb- I use this stick vac -lrb- psv1800 -rrb- . its great for small job do between my weekly vacuuming . where do I use it ? on carpeting , hard floor and furniture . at first it be great on all surface , but after a few month its do better on carpeting than hard floor . I try to vacuum my small car with it , but its length make that awkward . although it fold , the fold be in the wrong direction to make it short enough to use in the car . << Edit Nov 2009 I take it apart recently when it stop pick up altogether . I find that the filter be completely clog . after I clean off the dust -lrb- the filter be re-usable -rrb- it work a good as new ! so I recommend clean the filter every couple of month . >> i use it mostly in the kitchen , dining room and living room . I also use it in my entry way too to prevent dirt from be track all over the house . how 's the battery life ? supposedly it will last 20 minute . but I have not run it for more than 5 minute at a stretch , so the battery have not die on I yet . be it easy to use ? yes , just unfold it and hit the on switch . however , it do require a little strength . it weigh only 5 pound , but concentrate along a stick that could feel heavy . its a little lighter than a gallon of milk -lrb- 8 pound -rrb- . empty the dust , crumb and dirt be a cinch . its bagless , so you open a compartment and everything will fall out . I have not have to reach in and scrape out dust yet . con the price keep this vacuum from earn 5 star . I do not think its worth $ 100 .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I have have this vacuum for 9 month now . the roller brush stop so I put a new belt on that come with the vacuum . it work for one day before it break again . vacuum repair guy say it need a new roller brush and be go to cost I $ 75 to repair . that be half of what it cost in the first place . four year ago , I buy a 12 amp Dirt Devil very basic vacuum for $ 30 -lrb- because I have mostly tile -rrb- . it be still run great , just think I need a more powerful vacuum ... I think wrong . bigger be not always better ... oh yeah , my mom also have a Eureka vacuum a little older than mine - totally different model and guess what ? same thing happen to she vacuum cleaner ! so now I be face with do I fix or do I buy another ? if I do decide to buy another , it will not be a Eureka .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be a great vacuum as far as suction go . more power than anything we have ever own . it have a couple of drawback , but I suppose they be worth it ... it be very heavy ... the cord do not retract automatically -lrb- wish they would add this feature ! -rrb- ... and it be loud . that say , it work very well . I can not believe how much stuff it suck out of we carpet . we have two cat and a dog ... work great on pet hair too .
Vacuum	POS	5	my husband and I buy this handy little vacuum about six month ago and we use it almost daily . great suction , easy to empty , and the tool be extremely handy . this be the first small cordless vacuum I have ever own that have hold up to the small household chore I use it for with perfect dependability . great value for the price . would buy it again and again .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I can not wait to return this to the store . after charge it the allotted time , I try to use it , and when it fail to lift crumb , figure I have not charge it enough . so I re-charge . the power -lrb- or lack of power -rrb- in this hand vac be a total joke . it do not vaccum up a thing . what a total waste of money , this product should not be allow on the market . do not wate you money , you will just be return it .
Vacuum	POS	5	it be a great vacuum that have great filter to trap dirt and relatively quiet for its strong motor . it be a bit on the heavy side , but it be normal for a strong vacuum . overall I be really satisfy with the choice .
Vacuum	POS	5	this work exactly as I hope it would . my cat manage to spread litter all over the place despite my best effort to keep it contain . this vacuum quickly and easily pick it up , be easy to handle and to empty . it be a real life and time saver for I .
Vacuum	NEG	2	First off , do not buy this vacuum if you think you will use the hose\/attachments to clean drapes\/furniture . for some unfathomable reason detach the hose open up a unfiltered exhaust ; whatever you vacuum with the attachment blow right out the back , cover the vacuum , the vacuumer , and the room you just vacuum in dust . it be literally worse than do nothing . the build quality seem pretty cheap ; a plastic clip snap off when I attach the handle , and this be with I follow the direction and not force anything . for floor vacuuming , I can not seem to find a setting for most of my rug that allow the vacuum to glide while still pick up dirt . the three filter system be also ridiculous . why this vacuum get such rave review be totally beyond I . I be between this vacuum and the Eureka Airspeed and settle on the Bissell since target be closer to I than Walmart . if I be you I would try the Airspeed .
Vacuum	POS	5	this be by far the best vacuum cleaner I have ever own !! it be very powerful , you can see dirt be pull out of the carpet & float right in front of it . it only truly do edge vacuum on the right side , but that have not be a problem for I . my last vacuum say it do the edge on both side , but actually do neither . the Carpet pro say it do one edge vacuuming & it work wonderfully ! I upgrade the filter with a Fuller Brush Heavy Duty hepa filter . I also use cloth-like heavy duty allergen bag . my old vacuum make my allergy go crazy the rest of the day , now , no problem after vacuum ! so much better than a bagless ! some thing to keep in mind : the brush do not turn off , which may be a problem for wood floor make sure to order a Carpet pro with the `` t '' at the end to get the onboard tool from what I understand the lower end Carpet pro do not have as many metal part -lrb- you may want to double check this -rrb- so I would go with this one . if you care about a headlight & bag-indicator , check out the higher end Fuller Brush vacuum that be make by the same company -lrb- who also make riccar -rrb- . look for the Fuller Brush vacuum with the metal plate , etc. . that be about all I can think of , I be totally happy with my purchase -lrb- I have have it for about 8mo . now -rrb- , and I highly recommend this vacuum !
Vacuum	NEG	2	about a week after I buy this product the belt break . my neighbor have buy it recently too and they put it out on the curb for the trash collector as they 's break too . my partner fix the belt , but it do not really work that well , especially with the attachment . would not buy it again !
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy this a couple month ago and it work perfectly . before this we have a cheap bag less vacuum from Walmart . I hate it . this bagged vacuum be much better . seem to pick up everything I vacuum over . and I love the bare floor option . I do not think I would use it but we have a cat little box on tile and this vacuum work like a charm . I do not have to get the broom and dustpan out each time now . I just run the vacuum over it and it pick it all up ! it seem to be a little heavier but I do not mind that at all , if anything it just feel solid . I love it and I would recommend it to anyone look for a new vacuum cleaner .
Vacuum	POS	4	i compare this product with the major retailer , the product be cheeper by 20 buck and work very well . I be happy with the product . unfortunately i dont use it any more ; move in a tile location . .
Vacuum	NEG	1	total junk , plastic mechanism to engage and disengage roller break from day one , my mistake be not pack it up and send it back . order it from Amazon be no problem .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I have have this vacuum for two day . before this one , I have another almost identical Bissell which , in my opinion , be not old enough to have give out on I . I have take care of the filter , and empty the dust bin every time . I give Bissell another try because I be familiar with it and I think if the model be not good they would not continue make it the same exact way . I vacuum once every day with the previous vacuum and it pick up everything visible and leave nice vacuum mark , and to I that mean clean . I do not know how wrong I be until I buy this one . I give this model 's initial suction power 5 star . I be absolutely horrify at what come out of my carpet . shock . I go five swipe over the carpet and the bin be full , mostly of ultra-fine dust . I have to empty it 7 + time in my average-sized home at the initial cleaning . I vacuum the whole house again and I notice it be lose suction . I inspect and notice that it be clog , and when I try to use the hose attachment , it be full of dust and come out all over the floor when I pull it out . same two problem with my previous Bissell . I have to take this one back to the store because it just be not good enough to hold up to normal use . I would have give the model 4 star , take responsibility for my own carpet be so filthy but then realize that the reason my carpet be as filthy as they be be because of the poor performance of my previous Bissell . the carpet be new when we buy this house , so Bissell 's performance be overall unacceptable . that be why this Bissell only get 3 star from I , and why I will not buy a Bissell again . when I see how much dirt and dust come out at the initial cleaning , I say to myself , `` no wonder we be always congest , sneeze , and sick . '' not cold -- but allergy ! I do not want to invest much money in a vacuum -lrb- perhaps therein lie the problem ? -rrb- , but it look like something exceptional be necessary .
Vacuum	POS	5	I recently purchase this vacuum to take with I on vacation . I be look for a small vacuum with a hose that be either cordless or rechargeable and affordable . it be even smaller than I expect , which make pack it very easy . it also work well with the space-bag we use for we clothes and bedding . I be very pleased and would certainly recommend this vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	we have 2 cat , one of whom constantly shed 1-inch guard hair . I estimate -lrb- from brushing he -rrb- that the amount he shed per day be about as much as you can hold in you cupped hand . I find that after each run , the Roomba MUST be clean , and this take a really long time since the cat fur get stick and wrap around the brush 's gear shaft to the point where you need scissors to get they off . the fur also get stick on the brush , cause the Roomba to stop pick up any more fur after a short while . all in all , it be faster and MUCH less messy to just vacuum , than it be to clean the Roomba of cat fur after a single run . although the Pet series Roomba may work well for dog , I find it do NOT work well for cat . I regret have get this device .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this vacuum be a good deal if you just wanna use it to vacuum floor but if you use the suction hose alot -lrb- as I do -rrb- it stink . the vacuum be so light that it tip over constantly with just a slight tug on the hose . so you have to keep one hand on the hose and one on the vac to hold it upright . Wish I have my old Eureka yet !
Vacuum	POS	5	I receive my new Miele Callisto today . I must say it work better than any vaccuum I have ever have . my only problem be that after spend $ 900 on a vaccuum , I would think I could get a operating instruction booklet specific to my vaccuum . not true . I be send a generic booklet for the 5000 series . most of the picture and instruction do not match . in fact , if I have not already have a canister vaccuum of a different brand , I would not be able to figure out how to put this vaccuum together or use it . but , I give it 5 star because it be a really great vaccuum .
Vacuum	POS	4	we have struggle over the year to find the right vacuum for we need , which be to clean up enormous amount of pet hair from three huge , shed dog from we wood floor . if we go more than a day or two without vacuum we end up with giant pet-hair-bunny roll around everywhere . however , virtually all of the vacuum we try fall short for one reason or another . then we decide to take a chance on this vacuum , and while it be not perfect it have be , by far , the closest fit for we need . pro and con as follow : pro : it have a long cord . we can do we entire house from one central plug with no extension cord . we house be smallish , so this may not apply to larger house , but the cord be very long by vacuum standard , which be convenient . it be lightweight and maneuverable . we typically use the shoulder strap across we chest to the opposite shoulder which hold the vacuum in place securely , and leave both hand free for vacuuming\/picking up\/moving furniture\/etc . it can reach into small space . a lot of we furniture sit on leg that be about 3-4 inch high , leave a area underneath that can gather mountain of pet hair . use the smaller attachment , the long extension , and the long hose , we can easily vacuum under we couch , table , and other furniture without move they . it be powerful . this vacuum gobble up all the dirt , dust , and pet hair in we house without any issue . good assortment of attachment . con : the bag be messy to empty . it be a reusable bag , although you can also buy disposable bag if you choose . the shoulder strap can be uncomfortable . as I say above , we wear the strap across we chest to the opposite shoulder , and the strap pull against the side of the neck , and can chafe . we end up buy the  Domke U.S. Post Office shoulder pad  there be no place to store\/organize attachment when not in use . so if you be use one attachment and want to switch , you have to go back to wherever you have the attachment store and get the new one . we solve the storage by use coathook on the inside of a closet door , include one to hang the vacuum from , but it would be nice if the attachment be either attach to the unit at all time , or at least in a carry bag or something you could cart around with you easily . none of the attachment be power , mean no beater bar or spin brush . for we this be not a big issue since we house be mostly hardwood floor and leather\/vinyl seating , but if you have a lot of carpeting or rug , and\/or want to use it on cloth upholstery , this might not be the vacuum for you .
Vacuum	POS	4	we purchase this vacuum a few month ago to replace a canister style Kenmore which serve we well for 8 year . I love the small size and lightweight nature of this machine . it have a strong suction and be quite powerful for its size . my 9 yr old buzz the kitchen - bit of food , dog hair , dirt - easily and efficiently with the wand in one hand and the shoulder strap over she shoulder . make the strap convertible to a backpack option -lrb- I do not like to walk with the strap across the other shoulder -rrb- and I would give it 5 star . it do well on both carpet and hardwood - we have tile , wood , and some area rug with not very deep pile .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I get this product for Christmas so I can not return it . I can not believe how many good review this prodict get . first , the beater bar stop work . I take it apart and find that a wire have come loose . I fix that . then by the third time I use this piece of junk the battery run down after 30 seconds of use . it continue to run down after 30 seconds or less of use , with a full charge . it be heavy . the suction be horrible . it will not pick up cat litter off of we hard wood floor . please do not buy this product . even when it work it do not do a good or decent job . I tell my husband the next time he go to the dump to take this with he .
Vacuum	POS	5	a terrific little appliance ! have a lot of power for its small size and be easy to use and empty !
Vacuum	POS	4	this item be purchase for a gift . it be not know at this time whether or not the product be good . the order and ship process be great .
Vacuum	NEG	1	purchase this vacuum after read many positive review . I have a Panasonic which work great for over ten year . this vacuum last two month -lrb- use it twice weekly on three low area carpet -rrb- and the motor would shut off after vacuum for ten minute . suffer another 9 month with this vacuum by shut it off and let it cool down every few minute . then the plastic hose break and I give up . I just purchase a Oreck .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I should have know the first time I use this vacuum that it be a piece of garbage , but I hold onto it because I hear so many good thing about Oreck . the first time I vacuum , the smell of burn rubber -lrb- the belt -rrb- be so bad and it barely pick anything up . so as I be advise , I replace the belt -lrb- after one use for a few minute , the original belt be already melting -rrb- . I live in a small apartment with hardwood floor , no pet and one wool carpet - there be no reason for the vacuum to malfunction like this . the vacuum continue to have the same problem , but when I readjust the belt before every use , it become somewhat tolerable , except for the many time I have to clean out the different compartment because of buildup -lrb- again , not sure how there could be so many issue with such a small , tidy apartment -rrb- . after some research , I learn that Oreck tell its customer to vacuum more `` gently , '' otherwise the belt be prone to burn or come apart . I tend to slowly glide and do not manhandle my vacuum , but I decide to vacuum very slowly and gently to see if it would fix the problem I be have . the problem have not subside , and have become even worse . I can not vacuum my one , small carpet without the smell of burn rubber , a complete lack of suction after about 2 minute , and have to readjust the belt or replace it every single time I want to use it . I be throw this thing away . save yourself the annoyance and the money . I have a small upright dirt devil that cost about $ 35 that work better than this thing . also , I never think I would miss have tool so much - you can not get anywhere near the baseboard and all the dirt that build up along you wall with this thing . and even if my vacuum have a manufacturer 's defect , why have not Oreck replace it ?
Vacuum	NEU	3	I have have the Portapower for over two year and feel that I have now have adequate experience to reflect on its good and bad point . I have also have a Miele canister and can compare it to another albeit far more expensive vacuum . in short , I think you get what you pay for . here be the major problem of the Portapower . 1 . the portapower do not come deliver with the ability to dispose of the bag . really , you have to purchase a additional piece of plastic that convert the round mouth to a square mouth in order to then use disposable bag . the vacuum come with a single fabric bag that be not easy to empty or clean . it be best do outside and with a perfect knowledge of where the wind will blow the bag contents . 2 . the Portapower have virtually no filter for retainer fine dust . absolutely no ability for a hepa or similar filter , unlike the Miele . when you turn on the Portapower you should expect that the room will start have a stale smell , which be from the expulsion of fine dust out the back of the vacuum . the Miele do not have that problem . 3 . the portapower do not have a retractable power cord . the Miele have one that you can activate with you foot . this difference might seem trivial but become a hassle . it come with a band that be intend to tie the fold cord -lrb- about 30 foot -rrb- , but it be so flimsy that it amaze I that any thought be give to its adequacy . even a velcro strap would have be a better solution . 4 . the power of the Powerpack be not go to blow you sock off . instead , I think you will find that it be barely adequate . 5 . by no means be this vacuum design to commercial specification . aside from the tube , there be no metal part . the latch to open the canister to access the aforementioned dust bag be incredibly flimsy . the accessory fitting be noticeably cheap plastic that be not design with a goal of minimize clog . for the Miele the plastic seem much more substantial and the tube diameter be noticeably larger , clearly design to make sure that clog be minimize . moreover , the Miele canister have a compartment for the accessory , while the Portapower have no such feature . on the good side be that the Powerpack have not fail in two year of light use . if I be in a position of purchase a vacuum today , I would spring for the extra cash and purchase a bare bone Miele for $ 300 . I know that it be unfair to compare the portapower to a vacuum that be more than twice as expensive , but I do it only to let the prospective purchaser know that s\/he have not yet reach the price point of marginal diminish return .
Vacuum	NEG	1	my husband buy this vacuum to replace we eureka bagless vac . it be great after the first use but after a couple time of use it start have the same problem as we past vac . it start to spit out debris behind and also when when you use the attachment , it also blow out dust . such a pain to clean the filter . now I be really think of go back to the old school bag vac . do anybody know a vacuum worth the money anymore ?!
Vacuum	NEG	2	we be on we 2nd one of these . the first vacuum have the foot pedal come off frequently and and issue w \/ the height adjustment . we take it back to the retailer within 90 day for a replacement , per instruction from the Eureka support hotline . the 2nd vacuum be better , but have issue . 1 -rrb- hose be too long on bottom by design , so it fall out of the cradle when not be use , so you have to pull excess slack back and make a loop at bottom . 2 -rrb- it go through belt quickly , if you suck up a sock or other , you have milli seconds to turn the power off , before the belt burn and break . 3 -rrb- if you bump the front plastic bumper , then it will start rub and make noise , then you have to pull the plastic back out . 4 -rrb- hose broke\/coming apart at connection to straight attachment , after 2 year .5 -rrb- belt clutch slip , when upright , you shut off the brush for hard floor cleaning . you find it spin when you do not expect and possibly scratch the surface or wear carpet in place . a major independent consumer magazine give this high mark , and usually I agree with they on product , but not this time . prior to this vacuum , my last Eureka Boss last 15 year , and work well , infrequently need belt . I do not think we will make 4 year w \/ this vacuum before throw it away .
Vacuum	POS	5	UPDATE : after two month of use ... I give it five star again . people , this be for small clean up job not vacuum whole home !! here be a tip . after you have cycle through five charges\/discharges keep it plug in full time . so you use it for say two minute , plug it back in . keep it plug in and it will always be ready . original review : if you plan on use this as you only vacuum you will be disappoint . for smaller job this thing rock ! the pet hair tool really work ... be a bit skeptical it could lift up month of thick cat hair but no problem . battery life be 10 + minute and I have only cycle the battery a few time . 10 minute be actually a fairly long time for most job . it be light , the tool do they job , it be powerful ... five star from I !
Vacuum	NEG	2	I be very disappoint with this vacuum . I just get the 18V Pivot Vac  Black & Decker Pivot Vac 18V Cordless Pivoting Hand Vac , phv1810  I can clean my floor mat in about 1\/2 the time with the other vacuum because the suction power be much better . do yourself a favor and get that one as it be only a few dollar more , it be cordless and rechargeable and suck much more than this product . the Guy Fieri inspire color scheme be off-putting as well .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I think my title say it all . this be not in the same class as a simplicity , Dyson , or Oreck . but then , it be about 1\/3 of the price of one of those similarly configure vacuum . when one evaluate this model , one have to compare it to Hoovers , Bissells , Dirt Devils , etc. . base on my experience with those brand , this vacuum rank ahead of the class . frankly , it suck . but it suck very well . better than the Hoover Supremes I have have . as for the weight , well yes , it be heavy but not any moreso than the Hoovers or Bissells I have own . and besides , the weight be list in any advertisement or be apparent at time of physical purchase . I be 6 ' 200 pound and in decent shape . the weight be not a issue for I . but for someone half my size , I can see where it would be a pain . if that be the case , you 'll need to look at more expensive model -lrb- that be lighter -rrb- to get the sort of power that this have . in any case , the attachment work as well as any , the cord be just as obtrusive as the other , and the plastic design look just as attractive and feel just as cheap as hoover . it be more powerful than other in it be class . aside from that , everything be pretty much the same . my only fear be that the belt will break easily , as it be terribly thin and appear very flimsy . but I do not know that for a fact . I 'll amend this review if that be the case . if you budget for a vacuum be $ 300-500 , then by all means buy a simplicity . if you budget be $ 150-300 , buy a refurbish simplicity from a reputable dealer . but if you , like I , be satisfy with a ` Chevy ' and have no problem replace it after 5-10 year or so , this might be the best deal for you . by the way , I pay $ 118 with free shipping for this . I might have pay $ 10 more but that would have be my limit with this class of vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	5	for starter , consider that high-quality consumer vac be run $ 200 - $ 300 , and substantially more if you go with a Dyson or something . we seriously consider a Dyson canister , and I be very , very happy that we skip it . it not only would have be a waste of money , it would have be less convenient . we have a triplex -lrb- 3-story -rrb- apartment in New York . all hardwood floor , and lot of stair . this thing be absolutely , totally perfect for it . the suction be huge , even after week of use in a apartment full of dog hair . it be design so effectively that all the hair get suck deep into the bag , and do not block the airflow . the bag be a long-lasting cloth bag that be very easy to remove and empty , and there be no additional cost for consumable . however , if you would prefer a paper bag that you do not need to empty , you can use those instead . either way , it work great . it also work great on we area rug , because the suction be very good . it be very lightweight , and come with both carry-handle and shoulder-strap . so you can range all over the apartment , over and around thing , up and down the stair , carry it comfortably all the way . my wife be a little smaller than I , and also find it very light and great to use . the long , super-strong metal tube , with rotate head , work its way really conveniently underneath and around the table , chair , and other furniture . it come with great attachment for baseboard and other need . the metal tube have a secure lock mechanism , so it be both easier to disassemble than a plastic one that often get stuck , and easy to reassemble and snap together . it be go to last forever . the flexible hose be make of really strong material , with a rigid , springy coil inside . it do not crimp , fold , bunch or otherwise cause problem . it also shrink nicely when you be not put any tension on it . which make it very convenient to store : it be super-compact to start with , and you can quickly pop the hose & tube off the main body of it , so you can store they wherever they fit best . incidentally , Hoover also include a very rugged strap to snap the cord in place when you be not use it . the power cord , by the way , be just incredibly long , so I can do a whole floor of the apartment , and get 2\/3 of the way down the stair , before I need to unplug and move the connection . it be the longest I have ever have , even on a full-size upright . we have have it for a month now , and use it often , and I have yet to find a single flaw with it . I suppose they could round the edge a bit more , so that when I be dance around the apartment with it sling over my shoulder , I do not even notice they . but that be about it . some reviewer suggest they integrate the attachment storage into the body of the vac . but that would dramatically increase weight and size , so it would be stupid . they could give you a little holder for they , but then they would have to charge you more , and you probably have a bag or drawer or whatever for they already . if you want , you can buy the $ 20 `` portapack '' carry bag , which include a spiffier shoulder strap , and a little mesh bag for the attachment . but if you do not need it , they have save you the $ 20 . unless you have deep-pile carpet , or a dog\/cat that constantly shed fine hair -lrb- and so you need a vac with a power head -rrb- , this be a really phenomenal performer , and a amazing value , which be much more maneuverable than a upright could over be .
Vacuum	NEU	3	First off , I 'll try to be as objective as I can with the admit limited experience with vacuum cleaner -lrb- probably around the same as anyone who do not work in the vacuum or cleaning industry -rrb- . this be my first bagless cleaner , I have use a Eureka and a Hoover for a combined 12-13 year before switch to this . the vacuum cleaner have great suction , but I have learn several thing that potential buyer should probably be aware of : 1 -rrb- probably the most minor gripe be a lack of a `` brush switch '' that switch off the main brush when you be use the hose , which I have on my previous -lrb- admittedly more expensive -rrb- Hoover . the vacuum be design so that the front pop up when its in the upright position , but I find that the brush still rub against my not-very-high carpet . 2 -rrb- the hose be nowhere near long enough if you want to vacuum stair , I have to move the vacuum every couple step to keep the thing from tip over . and I do not know why a stiff plastic piece be at the end of the hose , it make vacuum in tight space a hassle -lrb- I get that it be for reach , but would not it be nice to have it as a removable piece so you have the option ? -rrb- 3 -rrb- be prepare to buy a extra filter , the helix design be not the best , as it rely on spin the air to fling out particle of dust , which settle into the cup , the problem be , once a little dust start to clog the little slit and filter up , the suction weaken , which reduce the suction a little bit allow more dirt to get suck into the filter , which reduce the suction a little bit more , and so forth . a cyclone be slightly better because the swirl of air travels upwards , allow more dirt particle to settle what wind up happen be the filter quickly clog up and it lose suction quite quickly . my place be not very big , maybe around 1500 sq ft , and I vacuum once every 2-4 week , and I find I have to wash the filter nearly every time . 4 -rrb- lastly , and most importantly , let you filter dry overnight after you wash it , and run you vacuum for a few minute after install it to make sure its dry . I make the mistake of not run it -lrb- though I do let the filter dry overnight -rrb- and the next time I use it , it smell like rotten fish . I have to take the whole thing apart and clean everything to get rid of the smell . would have be nice if they have a sort of catchment to trap any water that might have drip . other than that , I find the vacuum to be acceptable , though have to wash the filter so often be a hassle and make a royal mess . I be not sure if all bagless vacuum require so much cleaning and emptying , but next time I 'll probably go back to a bagged one , or try a cyclonic vacuum make sure its less of a hassle to clean first .
Vacuum	POS	5	be look for a good quality vaccum for the new car . trust this brand since I have a few of they other product . this really be a great buy and good quality vaccum , pick up just about everything , be relatively quiet and nicely compact . would recommend to everyone .
Vacuum	POS	5	I love this little vacuum ! I work in a nursing home and we have a couple of they and we maintenance and housekeeping staff use they to clean in the little crack in doorway and such . for such a little vacuum , I think the price be a little high , but be a commercial Hoover product and because the one at my work be definitely older model and still work great , I expect to get year of good use out of this little vacuum . the only problem I have encounter thus far be that I can not attach my miniature detail attachment to the hose , but I be go to rig up a adapter with some pvc pipe to fix that . other than that , I be highly satisfied and highly recommend !
Vacuum	POS	5	I have try many car vac . this one be far superior to any of they . the design allow you to reach tiny corner and space . it have plenty of power to most job .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I be a mom with 3 kid and a minivan -lrb- stereotypical , but true -rrb- . I buy this because I need a cordless vac that I could use in the car and my dust buster be not cut it for suction . yes , this have better suction , but it take 20 hour to charge and literally only work for 5 minute . the motor start to slow before 10 swipe and you feel like you be race the clock try to get the cleaning do before it die while the suction be decrease in strength the whole time . Cleaning be annoying enough , I need it to be stressful too ? Ok , so it be only 5 minute of stress , but annoying nonetheless . realistically , with 3 kid and a minivan , 5 minute be not go to get my car clean , and you actually have to charge it another 20 hour before you can use it with any evidence of effective suction . unrealsitic and basically useless . it do have a pet hair tool which may be useful , but we have no pet hair to clean . honestly , if you need to clean pet hair , save you money and use one of those mask tape lint brush from the dollar store !
Gloves	NEU	3	I be in construction and need to wear glove . these glove fit and be comfortable while work , and I use they more often than regular leather glove . the drawback , though , be that while the tip last longer than regular glove the side of the finger tear apart after only 2 month . I think that for the price , I be better off buy leather glove .
Gloves	POS	5	these welding glove do what they be suppose to . I just start use they so I can not speak to long-term durability but they feel as strong as any other leather welding glove I have use . when put they on for the first time , they be very comfortable and fit pretty well . I normally wear size l glove . I hope this help because I be use they for welding and not for a costume . I guess I can not blame they though , if I be shop for something , I would want what I see in the picture . in my case , my glove be the same color as what be picture ; maybe just a tad darker .
Gloves	NEG	1	I have have several pair of ironclad glove that be quite satisfactory ; however , the last pair purchase start come apart immediately . the closure at the wrist -lrb- on one glove -rrb- fall off the first time I wear they . all of the stitching be unraveling . sadly , it appear they quality have decline significantly .
Gloves	NEG	1	these be extremely uncomfortable workout glove . I use a few time then purchase another brand . would strongly recommend against purchase these .
Gloves	POS	4	fit well , be comfortable . the big plus and minus be that these do not have the velcro wrist closure like the original . . this mean they be easier and more convenient -lrb- and hence more likely to be use -rrb- . . the minus be the minor possibility of debris enter at the wrist . . buy these . .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be comfortable and the price be right ! I have not use they for any heavy duty work - mostly just lug around dirty car part - so I can not really comment on how well they hold up to abuse . they clean up nicely after I get they full of grease and gunk . Might just pick up another pair to keep around the house
Gloves	NEG	1	these glove be comfortable to wear , however the leather separate and disintegrate on the middle finger on the SECOND use . these be not heavy duty glove as advertise . not even light duty glove . very disappoint .
Gloves	POS	5	I wear these glove for work , where I be constantly digging with a shovel , pick , or bar and they be outstanding . they endure as long as any good pair of work glove should . I also use they to operate heavy equipment which require dexterity from a glove and they perform well there as well . more interestingly however be that I wear they skydive . while skydive it be necessary to use a glove that allow you to feel so that you can find you hacky use to deploy you main parachute ... and if necessary so that you may feel you emergency handle . it be also desire to have somewhat of a sticky texture for the very same reason , as well as to maintain a good grip on other skydiver when do `` relative work '' . despite the fact that these be `` fast fit '' they do not come off in the air , though they do allow I to remove they quickly if necessary . I have recently be jump in cold weather as well . I add silk liner when jump in cold weather but they be the only glove I can use with the liner and still maintain very good dexterity and feel , and be plenty warm when combine with the liner .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be the bee ' knee . they fit snugly without be overtight and have just the right amount of cushioning . I normally have my glove last year , so will have to see how long these last . I have get no reason to think they will not though . I be thoroughly pleased I buy they .
Gloves	POS	5	the ironclad general utility provide warmth , comfort , a excellent grip , versatility , and to top it off , they look great . what more could you ask for ?
Gloves	POS	5	these glove work great and be perfect and at the best price for vinyl powder free glove . they dont tear or leak perfect fit . totally recommend these glove for the application of color and relaxer .
Gloves	NEG	1	I get these when I start and I have buy much better glove since . pro - cheap - breathable palm con - hand compartment be very loose . this be dangerous ! - knuckle padding be insufficient - padding be at a weird angle so there be a gap between the glove and you hand . - wrist support be terrible ; handwrap can not make up for this completely . - fake leather be very thin especially on the palm side - stitching be fall apart if you plan to use these for more than aerobic , you will hurt you hand and wrist . if you get serious at all , you will probably upgrade within a month or two . just save you $ 25 towards better glove now .
Gloves	POS	5	I get these to do my `` pick '' in local garage sale and auction . I have long finger and they fit really well , I like leather better , but these really fit and I hope they last a while .
Gloves	POS	5	I order the G & f glove for my husband . they be leather and really sturdy , yet comfortable . additionally , they fit he hand ; many other glove do not . my husband and I recommend they .
Gloves	POS	5	I live the the hot and humid southeast US and get these as a outdoor wood glove for which they seem to work nice . hopefully they will hold up over time . I be glad that I choose the XL over the large since they come a little tighter than expect but I be confident they will stretch with use . overall a nice glove with good hand protection that I feel will handle anything I throw at they .
Gloves	POS	5	have have ALTUS Leather glove for a looong time , which do a pretty good job , these be quite a few grade higher in term of overall quality , comfort , functionality and convenience . sure my old ALTUS Gloves be washable however they really be not create with that in mind at all I imagine , give they be entirely leather and get very sweaty-dirty quite quickly . these harbinger breathe quite nicely indeed , fit very comfortably pre-break in , and have a keen sense of design both in cut and design . they really enhance you concentrative strength instead of less than optimal functionality insofar as try to always adjust to avoid grip\/palm pain for example . these be great for many different use aside weight ... I notice a reviewer mention they be great wheelchair glove , and I can clearly see how easily they can be . also great for drive , alot of outdoor work and also I find they to be great for tactical use and training as well . very nice subtle cushioning in all the right spot . personally I find the pair in black look rather appeal , very intelligent design and perfect stitching . and of course , be machine washable be ideal with no indication of degradation . for I one bit of advice would be buy a size larger for more dextrous use - they will shrink - although break back in just fine for lifting , however for thing that require more finite handling , I find shrink down and break in a larger size certainly make the difference . a couple pair will definitely come in handy for a very good time .
Gloves	POS	5	I have not actually use the glove yet , since I have not reach a high enough weight where I be limit by the pain in my hand , but I do try they on and they feel great . they also come promptly and without a hitch .
Gloves	POS	5	this be my first pair of mechanic glove . I must say , these be by far better than the blue latex glove mechanic usually wear . these actually offer great protection for you hand when work around heavy car gear -lrb- suspension , control arm , etc. -rrb- my only regret be I wish I buy these sooner when I be do more work on the car .
Gloves	POS	5	I do all my own work on my car in some stupid condition . a month ago i change the thermostat on my jeep outside when it be 30 degree outside . grant that be not subzero , but these glove surprising keep my hand decently warm and still able to tight screw by hand and do some pretty nimble task . from other review I read I be surprise by how warm they keep my hand and how much tactile feel they do remove . do not get I wrong these be not a winter work glove and these do keep much more tactile feel than other glove , but read other review you would think they be a second skin . I would really recommend the ` fast fit ' style as well because I always have task I need to take they on and off for work on car . all in all these be excellent glove and well worth the ten dollar I pay for they . they seem pretty durable as well . but we shall see !
Gloves	POS	5	I have be use these glove for several year now . they fit very nice and snug and last forever . tip - flip they inside out after each workout to let the inside of the glove dry out . if not , after some time , it start to smell . that go for all glove ... not only this one .
Gloves	POS	5	I be use a cheap pair of workout glove for about a year or so , and end up get callous on my upper palm , and sometimes after a heavy workout session I would feel my hand be sore from the bar . I wear these glove and the padding be so comfortable you do not feel any uncomfort on you finger or palm . definitely worth purchasing .
Gloves	POS	5	have use these glove for a while , on my 3rd pair , and they be great . slip they on and off with no problem , they fit my hand perfectly there be no bunching or loose fingertip which make I want to wear they for just about anything . the exterior do get cut up and nick pretty easily but I would rather the glove get tear up than my hand . I use they for pull up carpet , tack strip , work on the car , some yard work , hammering , put up wall stud , drywall , plywood , store holiday decoration and any other possible use I can come up with .
Gloves	POS	5	this be my third pair of ironclad glove . I use the other two very hard and be amaze at the durability . they feel like no other glove out there . I be so impressed with the glove that I be go to buy a lot for Christmas present . good job Ironclad . finally a good glove that I can wear all day .
Gloves	NEG	2	these may be decent glove for beginner but if you be a decent amateur fighter , train semus seriously , or throw heavy punch on the bag , pick another glove . I use these glove for about 3 week and the middle knuckle on my left hand be start to hurt from throw a lot of jab . I think I be just go to have to bite the bullet and buy a more expensive more serious hook and loop glove as these just dont do the job .
Gloves	POS	4	well padded , even too padded . its alot more padded than I expect , and actually , make the glove much bigger than I expect . if I have to do it again , I would probably buy the smaller cheaper , Harbinger glove . if I be want a bigger glove with lot of padding , this product would have be perfect .
Gloves	NEG	2	these dainty and delicate glove be a must have for anyone 's Halloween wardrobe . but I do not recommend they for actual metal work . as crazy as it sound , I use they for welding - hobby level at that - and the lining in mine rip free when put my hand in on the second day . the feel lining go up to the wrist , where it be sew to the leather shell , albeit poorly .
Gloves	POS	5	I work with alot of cardbord and it drye out my hand , and be realy rough on my hand , the glove have good grip and prevent my hand from be cut up .
Gloves	POS	4	good quality , tough glove . I order medium since my winter glove and the latex glove I use at work be also medium size . however , the glove run small . they be very snug , and although after several use they seem to be loosen up a bit , I still find myself struggle to `` peel '' they off of my hand from how tight they fit . highly suggest go one size bigger if purchasing .
Gloves	NEG	2	glove serve purpose . I use they surf -lrb- occasionally -rrb- & you do notice much more power in each stroke . they do fill with water which make the a little cumbersome & heavy increase fatigue . I would not recommend these for swim training -lrb- pool -rrb- , I have use plastic hand paddle & they work far better , but , as say these provide grip when out on the surf board & keep you hand slightly warmer .
Gloves	POS	5	I find some of these locally and I love they . they be well make , comfortable , and look cool . it be party make out of breathable material which I do not appreciate until a really heavy work out .
Gloves	POS	4	I buy these glove to wear during maintenance on my car . they be very comfortable and seem quite durable for the purpose I need they for . they breathe well and provide great grip when handle tool and other hardware . I do not want to spend a bunch of money for glove that be go to get greasy and dirty , so these fit the bill perfectly . the only reason they do not get 5 star be because it be hard to pick up tiny screw and bolt with my finger tip when wear the glove .
Gloves	POS	4	these weightlifting glove be exactly what I have hope they would be . they fit well and provide the appropriate amount of padding .

Gloves	POS	5	I be go to buy the velcro version of these but think I would try the fast fit glove as they be cheaper . im glad I do they fit really snug and stay on really well . they be well worth the price and I think be a better deal than the velcro one . make out of good material and really stand up to some rough work . they also allow you to work with smaller object unlike some work glove .
Gloves	POS	5	I love work out without any glove and I do not mind have callus on my hand . however , I purchase this glove for health\/sanitary reason . I hear that the weight be actually one of the dirtiest item . as a matter of fact , you can get some skin disease from it . when the package arrive , I inspect the glove . the glove be well make and it seem sturdy enough to last for long time . I believe this be a worth while purchase and hopefully it can last a long time . until I have a personal gym at home , this glove seem like it will do the job .
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these before go into a summer job at a golf course and want something where I could handle small thing but would be strong and protected . the extra padding on the fingertip be very good and useful . the glove be a great fit and they breathe well too . after look over a lot of different glove before buy I make a great decision with these and would definitely buy they again .

I swim lap twice\/week and go through a pair of these about every 2 year . the neoprene right past the wrist area will show `` wear '' with all the put on and take off over time , of course . I recommend this brand .

Gloves	NEG	2	this glove be just ok ... I like the leather palm , but it just do not fit as well as other glove that I have try . you can feel the seam in the fingertip and the glove leave blister on my hand , and blister be cause by movement . Make sure you get a good fitting glove . the Mechanix wear 4.0 glove be similar to this glove but with a better fit , any of those glove be better than this pair .

Gloves	POS	5	I drive a tow truck -lrb- Mindy 's husband here -rrb- , and these be a little light for I . I wear through the thumb and first finger in about 5 week of full time use . they be still great glove . I will be get another pair , and save the heavy stuff for bulky leather glove .
Gloves	NEG	1	I buy these to use with my heavy bag . I have average size hand and these fit almost perfect , maybe slightly loose , without wrap on . but you need to wear wrap , and these would not fit with wrap on . also , the chemical smell on this be pretty strong and it make I feel nauseated . I be not sure what to do , because I do not want to spend a lot of money for glove . but these be useless .
Gloves	POS	5	one of the best glove , for a certain type off weight lifting . I use it for my chest exercise , it give very good padding , but if you a look something that will give you a good grip , get something else .

I use they for food preparation -lrb- raw meat , dice chili pepper , etc -rrb- and they have be excellent . many similar glove I have get in the past will have several glove that tear or break when I put they on , but none so far for I ! the only thing be the glove be a little large ; I order XL and wear XL for most other glove-related thing , and these glove be somewhat -lrb- barely -rrb- loose . I kind have expect glove to be a little more snug , so I guess I 'll buy l next time around .
Gloves	POS	4	these fit small compare to my other harbinger glove . my other set be a medium , so I figure a medium would fit . it do not . should have order a large . the skin between my finger always get pinch . I still tolerate it though . these glove have padding in all the right place for every exercise , pushup , bar , free weight ... after a few month of use these glove , they still do not smell which be AWESOME . I could not handle the smell of my old glove and I could not get rid of the smell . they be not the wash & dry like these either which be why I retire they , even though they be still physically in good condition . these do not show much wear\/fatigue indictive of failure . very well craft and build to last like my old harbinger glove . would recommend and buy again .
Gloves	POS	5	I have be lift for over 20 year and I like the feeling of control\/comfort a good pair of glove afford I . as of late however , I develop a cyst on the palm of my left hand which impact my daily routine . I read the review on this glove and most people say it be heavily padded which be something I want . I have use harbinger before and they seem to last although they be not as padded as these be . I be concern about what size to order , so I go with what I use with the previous harbinger I own - large . well , they be well-padded for sure and may be a little uncomfortable for some people but they do the trick for I . I can hardly feel the cyst and I think they actually enhance my workout by provide a much better grip . I have be use they for about 3 week now and they seem to be wear well and provide the support I need . they feel a little stiff at first but as you use they they become more comfortable . the glove seem to be make well , time will tell if they can withstand the abuse .

I can reach into my pocket and GRAB A PEN WITHOUT EMPTYING the contents of pocket on the ground . EVEN HANDLING MONEY be no problem . THESE GLOVES be woth the price of admission .
Gloves	POS	5	IRONCLAD ? what else do you need to SAY ... the ONLY GLOVES MY MEN will wear .
Gloves	POS	5	it be ridiculously difficult to find decent work glove in a size small ! I guess in order to not be emasculate , lot of glove start at a size medium , and as a chick , that be still too big for I . with these , the small not only fit ... like a glove haha , but the quality be way better than what I have be use in a synthetic glove . price be very reasonable for what you be get . in case anyone want to know the content : 50 % synthetic leather 30 % polyester 10 % elastic 5 % foam 3 % polyurethane 2 % polyvinyl chloride , Rubber
Gloves	POS	5	truly great glove use they right away to test they out , flexibility etc. . these be great and if they wear out I 'll be back for more . plus a sweat wipe be on the thumb area of the glove truly awesome

Gloves	POS	4	my guy love these glove , they be warm , tough and let he get the job do . they do not last as long as they use to .
Gloves	POS	5	of course it emphasize the arm and shoulder . I have very large hand -lrb- 6 ' 4 '' -rrb- and base on the review I go with the large . the fit be fine for my hand which be skinny but the finger cut into the web of my hand so I wish I would buy the XL . it be not a problem once I start swim though . my arm get more of a workout but they be not sore and it be not as dramatic a difference as some say . however , anything that make swim more interesting be worth twice the price .
Gloves	POS	5	thank you very much ! I be extremely happy with the fast service of this item . I sincerely and wholeheartedly appreciate it .
Gloves	NEU	3	boy have I have a hard time find a pair of weight lifting glove ! my previous one be simple leather Saranac glove , not much padding but they last for several year . the leather eventually rot out form huge hole . but I can definitely say that the Saranac glove be awesome . now onto the replacement . I try four different type of glove . harbinger 143 Harbinger 1260 Harbinger 1215 Big Grip II GoFit Diamond-Trac The Harbinger 143 glove be ok . they do not have too much padding , but fit very snug and be difficult to get off . also , the finger be short . the Harbinger 1260 and 1215 be both unusable due to have too much padding in the palm and knuckle area . the padding be comfortable for press exercise -lrb- e.g. bench press -rrb- , but make it all but impossible to do pull exercise -lrb- e.g. pull up , curl , deadlift , row , etc. -rrb- . you can try they yourselve , but save some money and take my word for it . the GoFit Diamond-Trac glove be the best of the bunch for my need . they have a little padding in the palm , but not enough to interfere with you grip . they be lightweight , so I be not sure how long they 'll last , but I 'll reserve judgment on that . they do make my hand sweat , because the neoprene on the back do not seem to breathe well . they run a little larger in size than the other glove . also , I like that they have a finger tab to help you pull off the glove . please be kind enough to indicate if review be helpful .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be great for just about everything . they be well make and have great padding for you fist . Ive upload photo of the product which do come with the new yellow `` e '' Everlast logo . these glove be firm so if you do want to do any kind of spar both partner should have proper protective headgear on . if you be look for a great pair of training glove and do not want to spend of $ 30 these be a awesome buy . I order the 16 oz glove which be not to large be small .
Gloves	POS	5	I want to add a little resistance to my lap swimming and water aerobic workout . these glove work really well . I like that my finger be free , and the velcro strap make it easy to adjust .
Gloves	POS	4	so far so good . they come in small size which be good for my smaller hand . I have a question . what be the 2 little tab that be attach near the inner wrist ???
Gloves	NEU	3	I buy a pair of these for work here on the ranch . the first day i split the first layer of leather , but I be rotate the chain on my chainsaw to get a jam out . Probily not design for that . they have some thread that have unravel and a few more cut but I have really run they through the mill . sretch barb wire and drive t post . cut boi d arc post and such be hard on any glove . after a year they be still alive but not real pretty . most of the time I dont wear glove because skin grow back and glove dont but I be start to get tire of bleeding . I would say they be worth buy if you catch a deal on the .
Gloves	POS	5	appear to run on the tight size which maybe a advantage for more intrigate handling . not sure what happen when the glove become wet and then dry .
Gloves	NEU	3	contrary to the product description , these glove be not `` easy-on , easy-off '' . removal always require put down anything you be hold . with other work glove , I can remove one use a armpit and not involve the other hand . for someone like I who take a lot of beer break , open a can become a pain . as other have mention , these glove breathe well . too well for winter work , if you have dry hand like I . but I will probably use these in the summer . I have to admit , they do have a great feel .

Gloves	POS	4	I have use Harbinger glove for some time now and have be happy with they for comfort , fit and durability . I try these because it say washable and be happy with harbinger glove for the most part . the down side to they be the XL size I buy seem to be a large size , so they be a little tight and hard to put on and take off .
Gloves	POS	5	I boughtthese for my boyfriend for valentine 's day in red . they be a little small for he big hand but he do not complain about much discomfort . they come promptly and be package very nicely . I be happy with my purchase !
Gloves	POS	5	I choose these Swim Gloves for resistance training since I want a workout that be less strenuous than one use  swim Paddles  as a beginner , if you swim with the golve finger close -lrb- normal freestlye -rrb- , you get a great lower resistance workout . by gradually open out you finger in the webbed glove , you workout become more strenuous - even approach that of swim paddle ! I love the comfort and natural feel of these Speedo Aqua Fit Swim Gloves . I can even adjust my goggles without have to take off my glove ... something that be impossible to do with paddle on ! I choose the color blue because it complement  my Speedo Lap Counter Watch  look at the note in customer image for a guide to choose the right size glove to fit you hand . see MY PHOTOS in CUSTOMER IMAGES OCTOBER UPDATE : I have use these glove daily for the last three month and they still look like new ! clean they by just rinse or soak in fresh -lrb- tap -rrb- water ... remember - no detergent !
Gloves	NEG	1	I buy these glove and they have hole in they in a three day . the stitching come out . they be crap . $ 25 for what ? if you actually work for a living just get a pair of regular leather work glove . these might be fine for weekend warrior but I be a landscaper and these glove just do not cut it . honestly , do not waste you money .

Gloves	POS	5	we have purchase these glove previously through someone else and love they . the size be perfect for small man 's or woman 's hand . the quality be very good . the first pair last a long time -lrb- year -rrb- . these seem a bit thinner , but we will see how long they last . I highly recommend they .
Gloves	POS	5	I have purchase these glove in the past and they last I several year . the other thing I enjoy about these glove be the fact that the finger length be longer then normal which help protect my finger .
Gloves	POS	5	this be the second pair of these I buy in a medium . I have read about the problem people have be have with fit . my hand be typically a little smaller than a medium glove and these fit snug , a little tighter than most medium glove I buy . because I think they be suppose to be tight , this be probably about what I expect . I hope that help on size for you . the velcro do not always stay on , but I be not sure of a better way to bind they at the wrist . I be not even sure you need the wrist strap because the glove fit snugly and do not slip . be they the best around ? I do not know , I have the opportunity to try other brands\/styles on at the store and do not like the way they feel , but never use they in a pool . -lrb- I be not `` one of those guy '' , the store either do not have these or they be outrageously price . -rrb- anyhow , I buy they for my daughter think they would be handy for a river-tube trip and try they in the pool . they do not feel like they be do much until you be do swimming . then you arm feel sore , and if you take they off and swim it feel like you hand have shrink ... and you can not get power any more . in other word , what a great work-out ! I buy the second pair for myself I like they so much .
Gloves	NEU	3	can not really rate these as I have to send they back because the size chart they give you to go by be not quite accurate & the glove do not fit . I have give they as a gift & since I have to return they & pay the postage on return they I do not order another pair . it be just not a item that can be order on line . as far as the order , I receive it on time & I have no problem return it .
Gloves	NEG	1	I buy a pair of Ironclad Tundra Gloves for my brother for Christmas . he have a problem with keep he hand warm outside in the cold . I be willing to spend whatever it take to get he warm glove . I buy these think these be the best glove money could buy . they be to small for he so I keep they for myself . first time I use they while snowblow my driveway I damn near get frost bit finger . my mucher cheaper line leather glove be much much much warmer . do not waste you money on these .
Gloves	POS	4	these glove be perfect for workout involve heavier weight when a wrist guard be not prefer . both side of the glove be pretty heavily pad to avoid blister . also , I have have glove in the past with weak spot between the padding that easily rip . these do not . the only thing I find a little odd be the two little leather loop on the inside of the wrist . these be here to attach to the packaging . why be they leather and why be they permanent ? weird .
Gloves	POS	4	this be a excellent boxing glove for beginner . comfortable , lightweight and rugged exterior , perfect for someone who be want a kick-ass workout .
Gloves	POS	5	I have be use these glove for two year . the quality of fit be not match by any other glove money can buy . if you be do work that put a lot of wear on glove , such as haul firewood , go buy cheap leather glove . however , if you be go to be do work where you actually have to use you finger , or you find yourself take glove off every five minute to do mundane task , these be the glove to get . I use they outdoors everyday at work , and they work great for any activity where you need good grip , and maximum dexterity , such as shooting . for those review that complain about they not be waterproof , that be a advantage . these glove breathe much better than any waterproof glove , allow you to keep they on when you be use they to work in the 100 + degree weather . they also provide excellent grip and fit while soaked . I have use they dry down to 25 degree . if you be look for a glove to get wet in the winter , go buy ski glove . also , although it be not suggest by the manufacturer , I have machine wash and tumble dry these glove quite often , and have never have any ill effect .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be really durable . I have be lift for a while now and my hand be stop I because they be ache , but these glove really give I that good support in the right place .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove meet the purpose I need they for , they seem like they will last awhile unlike the Golds Gym brand I get from Walmart , they will seem very loose at first but once you break they in they relax to you hand very well .
Gloves	POS	5	great product for add to you water aerobic workout . you can really feel the difference . I use they in water aerobic and while walk lap in the pool . if you use they often , get two pair for the free shipping as the pool water really eat these up .
Gloves	POS	4	these glove be all wearn down but they last constuction work in winter hell . just make sure u dont get they wet they dry quick but when its cold you hand be better with they off . just throw they in the dryer and they be ready to go .
Gloves	POS	4	I buy these before and like they . I have to exchange this purchase because the size do not seem to stay consistent .
Gloves	POS	5	I be take a water Fitness Class , and do Deep-Water walk . I love these glove , they create a great resistance in the water for a really good workout . I be not sure what size to buy -lrb- I be a woman -rrb- and I buy a medium . I even go to the Speedo site to look at the size chart first . either I measure my hand incorrectly , or they run a little big . I think they be Unisex , so I probably should have order a small . it be not a huge deal , but since they cost less on Amazon than they do at most Sporting Good Stores , you may even want to try they on at the store for the correct size .
Gloves	POS	5	this be probably the best glove for light weight lifting and intermediate level ... it fit perfectly but I think you better try it at the sport store before you purchase it to ensure the right size ... I love this glove and I use it 5-7 time a week ... Great buy
Gloves	POS	4	these be really high quality and well make . I have get a couple of other harbinger glove at big 5 or the gym and they be much cheaper feeling .
Gloves	POS	4	Make sure to size up a little bit , otherwise the glove be great . I have not have any problem with blister after purchase the glove .
Gloves	NEG	1	my purchase of Speedo Aqua Fit train Swim Gloves be a dud . the glove begin fray at the fingertip end almost immediately . before two week have elapse , one glove be splitting at the thumb-to-index finger line of stitching . unusual wear be show on a pair my friend just purchase that he have use for two week . both pair must be return to Amazon . Len
Gloves	POS	4	in water aerobic , wear water glove with webbed finger amplify you effort . the Speedo glove hold up well in chlorine . I like the velcro fastener at the wrist .
Baby	POS	4	the sheep itself be very soft and very cuddly -lrb- i also have the back to sleep bear and the slumber bear by Prince Lionheart and these be not as well make or as attractive to a small baby -rrb- , the white sound -lrb- ocean and rain -rrb- be great and very effective although i prefer the in-utero sound of the slumber bear \/ back to sleep bear as they combine the heartbeat with a swooshy white noise that have be very effective for my daughter -lrb- the heart beat on the larger sleep sheep be very ` thumpy ' not white noise -rrb- . the timer setting be great , 25 min be ideal for my child , and 45 min for a more fussy night - Prince Lionheart go off after 5 min - however the Slumber bear \/ back to sleep bear be sound and movement activate and this be a real winner for I as my baby wake frequently at night and resettle herself when the white noise restart ... the only problem with the sheep be that i would have to go into the nursery to restart it myself and once my daughter see I she get upset when i leave again . the reason we have all 3 be that the first slumber bear we have stop work recently and we need 2 sound box go off at once to settle she because she like she white noise very loud to drown out she brother shriek \/ sleep talk ... I use this to get she to sleep initially and the back to sleep bear for resettle in the night .
Baby	NEU	3	I like everything about it & its a good size the only thing I do not like be that the little white plastic stick that hold the bottle be not strobg there all cheapy . . that be if yuh want to dry glass bottle . if you only use plastic or intend to use it for plastic only then this be for you
Baby	POS	5	love it . Super soft , and great gender neutral color . very easy to take on and off baby . Wish I could get it in a bigger size now that baby be get older .
Baby	POS	5	we begin use the Halo SleepSacks as soon as we son learn to roll over and could not be swaddle anymore . I love the soft , breathable cotton material . I can dress he in pajamas appropriate for the temperature \/ season know he will not be overheate with the cotton sleepsack on top . they be durable and wash well . I be happy that they come in x-large . my son be very tall for he age , but at 13 month he can still comfortably wear a sleepsack to bed . I think they be a safe alternative to blanket and more convenient for the child who toss and turn and would kick a blanket off anyway . as soon as we put on he sleepsack he be know it be bedtime . it be a great signal that end we bedtime routine .
Baby	POS	5	this be a really nice sleep sack . we favorite be a jersey one from the UK . this one be we backup . godd value .
Baby	POS	5	these be great bib ! this be the second one I have purchase already . I probably would not recommend this for baby who be just start solid -lrb- I use the cloth bib -rrb- but these be so great for self-feeder . they be easy to clean too : I either wipe they down with a wet paper towel or I wash they like I would regular dish -lrb- sponge & soap -rrb- for the extra messy meal . no stain so far on either one -lrb- even with spaghetti sauce -rrb- . love these !
Baby	POS	5	buy these for my newborn she have large finger and the gerber newborn mitten be too small . these be large she can open she hand . the material be also very soft and color be neutral
Baby	POS	5	I be so happy that I buy this pump ! I have receive a Avent single electric breast pump for my baby shower , and while I be only use it for occasional pump it be fine . however , once I go back to work , I need to pump more frequently and it take a very long time to pump both breast ... at least a hour for both , longer if I want to be thorough . since I be pump at least 3 time a day , that be much more time than I could spare ! I have research the high end pump , and I be go back and forth between the Medela pump in Style Advanced , Medela Freestyle and the Ameda purely Yours Ultra . since I be live in Europe at the moment , I realize that the Ameda be difficult to find , mean that part and support would be difficult to find as well , so that be out . I really want something hands-free but I do not want to pay so much extra for it , and from the review I have read , the hands-free apparatus can be complicate to use . so I opt for the pump in style and I be really glad I do . it be super fast ! really ! I can empty both breast in less than half a hour , rather twenty minute !!! that time save really add up and I would be happy just with that alone , but there be more positive . the adjustable suction power be great because my breast no longer hurt after pump . with my Avent you could adjust the speed , but not the power -lrb- which be quite strong -rrb- , and I never realize how much my breast have ache afterwards until use the Medela . it be easy to clean and it be much lighter than I expect . people have complain about condensation in the tube , but I just keep the pump on for a few minute with only the tube attach and have not have a problem . it be also much quieter than my old pump , and my little boy sleep soundly next to I while I pump . I also solve the hands-free dilemma by cut hole in a old bra which fit too tight , first position the breast shield , then attach the connector through the hole in the bra . the tight fit be important so the shield do not get displaced as the milk fill container weigh the pump down . that work great and I do not have to spend extra money . I only wish I could get larger storage container , but the 150ml one be the only one available here , mean that I have to stop pump to empty the milk into a larger container . that be the only negative I can think of . I highly recommend this pump , it be worth the money ! I only wish I would have buy it sooner .
Baby	POS	5	I receive this as a baby shower gift from my aunt and I absolutely love it , as do my husband . the music be not loud but it be not suppose to be , it be after all a device to get you baby to go to sleep . I be glad I ignore the bad review about the sound because that turn out to not be a concern of mine at all . it be so easy to assemble , take I 5 minute and it be do . I love the Bach , Beethoven , Mozart and Rainforest sound option - my favorite be definitely the rainforest though , very soothing . the ` fuzzy ' leave open and close and the leaf with the animal attach spin around slowly . this will definitely put any baby to sleep , it be so comforting and soothing . I would give this product 10 star if possible , I love it . it also go perfectly with we jungle theme baby room , it add the final touch to the room and it look perfect . I highly recommend this product to any and everyone .
Baby	POS	5	I have for the past year and I love the Medela pump in Style Advanced . since my son be 3 week old I have be pump exculsively and I highly recommend this pump . I have the model previous to this one , the only difference be the bag . I have travel serveral time in both airplane and car and this pump be great . the car adapter do not work the strongest in all car , however I can always get enough suction with the battery adapter . as with all pump I have have to replace membrane , but I find I could buy they online or locally . the ice pack for the bottle holder do not stay cold enough long enough for I , so I replace it with another longer last ice pack .
Baby	POS	4	the game itself be cute . however , I think the pacifier would already be cut out . they be not . everything come to you print on one sheet . I guess I should have open the box before the day of the shower . I do not , and so with not have enough time to cut they out , we be not able to use it . oh well . my fault I guess . should have inspect it closer when I get it .
Baby	POS	4	I buy two of these seat saver for my Honda Odyssey to accommodate Britax Marathon carseat . yes , the basis be wide , but be not that the point ? the non-slip surface on the underside grip the leather very well and my car seat have no slip and slide when latch in and secure . the front flap be great for keep melting snow and ice and general muck from my kid 's shoe off the front of the seat . I wish I would buy a third for the infant car seat !
Baby	NEG	1	this absolutely do not fit the Chico Keyfit 30 car seat . these car seat do not snap into the frame . do not waste you time purchase ! we have to return .
Baby	POS	4	these be great for when it be too warm for fleece sleeper , but too cold for no blanket . my only complaint be that even with closely follow the care instruction , we XL cotton sack seem to have shrink considerably . it just barely fit my 20-month old length-wise even though she be in the 50th percentile for height . even so , there be a gap in the market for product like this one , so I would consider this one to be a must-have . she will not keep a blanket on herself , so this be we only solution .
Baby	POS	5	I have read the other review and agree that the lid be a pain when up against a wall ; I have not experience a problem with the cushy seat . I have a toddler boy -lrb- tall and slender -rrb- who have be through another Safety First 3-in-1 potty , a large potty insert seat , and the Fisher Price Frog Potty all before my mother purchase this one to try . my son love it ! the first 3-in-1 do not have enough of a lip for pee , the insert seat be not comfortable and have a hard shield , and the frog potty have such straight wall that the pee will spray out front\/back\/sides at any give time . we use this potty downstairs and my son have actually request another one for upstairs . until something just as comfortable and with a cup that prevent spray-out come along , the other issue be not enough to prevent this from be the best potty out there for a little boy .
Baby	POS	5	love these bib for my refluxy baby . she go through several a day . they be a little bit big around the neck , but she be only two month and these be for three month and up .
Baby	POS	5	I agree with all the positive review . this bib be easy to clean and really catch all ! I have hand wash mine and I have not have any problem with it at all . I also dump one in the laundry by accident and it come out fine ! I buy other soft bib with pocket before and they turn moldy when they get wet . the hard pocket bib , like Baby Bjorn be awful . they be too hard and all my baby do be cry and try to rip they off when he have they on .
Baby	POS	5	I recently receive this for my daughter who be 6 month old . I have 2 previous halo sleepsack and love they , but she be outgrow they . the cupcake pattern be adorable ! she love sleep in she sleepsack , and they zip from the top down which make middle of the night diaper change very easy . we love this product !
Baby	POS	5	excellent product . would highly recommend this . my baby do not appear to like be swaddle with a blanket and always manage to kick she way out of it which worry I greatly , the thought of she get tangled in the loose blanket . I no longer have this worry and she seem to get a better sleep with the sleep sack and be warm throughout the night .
Baby	NEG	2	this bib be probably my least favorite and most seldom use . the `` special milk-catching design '' be just bulky under baby 's neck and do nothing to stop drip . the `` waterproof inner layer '' admittedly do save baby from get wet after one bottle malfunction , but it mean the bib feel kind of stiff . I be a lot happier with a thicker material bib instead that feel nice to touch and can be bent and fold as require . I would not recommend this to anyone .
Baby	NEG	1	so so mad because the monitor break after 10 day use . I have to wait another 6 day to get the Medela pump from Amazon to send home . my child have to eat formulum and express milk for 6 day . more stress and more tire for a new mom like I because of the unreliable machine . will not recommend this product .
Baby	POS	5	have be hunting for mitten that could stay on my son 's hand and finally find one . absolutely help when we go out in the cold and not that easy to pull it out ... Love the design and color . unlike other mitten these be soft on baby 's hand and still do not get wet very fast if he be suck . and best part - you can change the color by turn the shaded part the other way !!!
Baby	NEG	1	I hate these bowl . I be go to return they . the lid be super hard to get off and the suction do not work at all ! sometimes I can get the bowl to stick for a matter of seconds , and I can not get they off . then my son reach over and pull they off with no effort at all . if these be wash in the dishwasher and the suction cup be touch anything during the dry cycle , it will become deform and ruin any chance you ever have of it suction . I would not recommend these to anyone .
Baby	NEG	2	I get these lock because I do not want my son pull all the stuff out of the kitchen cabinet all the time . but they would not work with the way we cabinet be build and when I put they in drawer , they be pretty easy to pull off with just the adhesive . and two break when unsuspecting relative give they a tug think something be stick in the drawer\/cabinet . I be impress by the mechanic of how they work , but in the end it be just easier to put the non-child-friendly item out of reach . however , if you have a drill and the time to put they with screw - and you cabinet have the right size lip inside and the drawer be snug , it might really be what you be look for . my advice - get a couple and see if they work before buy into the whole system , which be what I do .
Baby	POS	4	these be pretty good cute and not too expensive . seriously hairclip be too expensive these day , especially consider we lose one almost everyday after daycare .
Baby	POS	5	this teether have work wonder for my daughter ! she never take a pacifier , but love this . she chew all over this thing and we have never have a problem with she choke or gag herself . we try so many different thing to help she with she teething pain , and this seem to be the only thing that really help . I 'll put in it the fridge for about 15 minute to get cool and then its all hers . also , when we first introduce this to she , she reject it for a few day . so do not give up on you little one , give they some time to get use to it . I would just set it on she high chair tray and let she decide what she want to do with it .
Baby	NEG	1	so I be currently take care of my 4th kid so I know a few thing about freezing milk . we have pack a freezer full of milk for 4 kid now over the past several year . Problem with these bag - when dunk a bag of frozen breast milk into hot water to thaw it out - the bag rip - a small hole will inevitably leak out milk . its happen about 70 % of the time out of the last 30 bag I have have to thaw . absolutely ridiculous . how hard can it be to make a milk storage bag ? the plastic need to be thicker .
Baby	POS	5	I use Avent 4 both my kid . it be great ! I recommend it to family n friend and most change to avert and stick with it !
Baby	POS	5	we purchase two pattern and love they both . it go well with we jungle theme . the quality be great , even after several washing it look new . I would recommend this for sure .
Baby	POS	5	my wife and I order these and be extremely happy with the quality of the material and finish . the cover be easy to use even with a newborn who be kick and scream ! the leg gusset really do prevent leak and we son be very comfortable in they . he be a relatively small baby at 6.5 lb but the x-small fit he perfectly and we expect it to last as he grow through 12 lb .
Baby	NEU	3	so far the actual diaper seem to fit well however I order the pattern `` Bubbles '' for my 2 month old and receive a pattern with huge ugly catfish on it -lrb- which be not even one of the pattern list ! -rrb- . they be not even cute & cartoon-ish , they be massive whiskery catfish - the diaper actually gross I out to look at ! I call to complain since it arrive a few day before we be to leave for vacation , and Amazon drop ship I a replacement which arrive 2 day before we be to leave . and of course , it be the catfish again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the sticker Amazon use to catalog say Bubbles , but inside have twice now be wrong . they have since -lrb- finally -rrb- refund I the money , but I need a swim diaper for we vacation , and thanks to Amazon we be out of time & out of luck : -lrb-
Baby	POS	5	my 7 month old grandson be in heaven ... he have two very sharp little bottom tooth and he immediately start chew and pull on this weird little thing . it be very pliable and soft all around and he love chew on the ring as well as the leaf . he do look rather clownish with the big green leaf on either side of he mouth but if he be happy , then I be happy . I buy three , two for we and one for he parent house and I put one in the freezer . my grandson be a big boy and this be a big pacifier , I be not sure if a smaller\/younger infant could handle it . but give it a shot , sometimes all they want to do be chew ...
Baby	NEG	2	I just order this and it be go right back . my 2 year old , be below or average height and pretty skinny too and the bag be still too small . he do not have much leg room width wise either . it be a good light weight sack if you order one size up for you tot . too bad mine be too big for it . i really want to like it . update : i order the merino wool kid 2-4 for my tot and it be PERFECT . pricey but perfect . lot of leg room and it be snuggly warm .
Baby	POS	5	I buy this blanket for we fussy 7 week old daughter and could not believe it - it make swaddle a snap !!! my daughter be a absolute houdinus and could get out of every swaddle blanket we try -lrb- and we be swaddle use Harvey Karp 's method -rrb- - but we try this one and it be the first she could not get out of - so from then on , it be the only swaddle blanket we ever use ! the thing that be so great about it be that not only do it make swaddle a snap but baby can not get out -lrb- or pull fabric up over they face -rrb- . I have buy one for every other friend expect and have always hear great success story ! Worth every penny !
Baby	NEG	2	i have buy several item from luvable friend and i will be honest to say i love they product . but these bib , although cute , be simply too small for we baby which be 5 month when we receive they . also the velcro part be too big and too rough .
Baby	POS	5	nice soft sleep sack that provide just the right amount of warmth for my baby . long length provide enough room for my boy to be comfortable . i would definitely buy it again . the only complaint would be that the color be not as bright brown as picture but more of a greyish brown ... do not really matter that much though
Baby	POS	4	it be very cute and it work well . the only thing be it be a little short . the baby really love it and it go with we theme .
Baby	POS	5	warm and soft . Easy to put on baby . my little one laugh at the zipper when we put it on he and take it off . Roomy enough for he squirmy little leg and do not restrict he sit up when he wake .
Baby	NEG	2	everything else about this spoon I like , except the handle be heavier then the top of the spoon . so everytime you set the spoon down in a dish , it fall 's out . ususally land on to the floor and make 's a mess . would not buy these a again .
Baby	POS	5	I think the sleep sac be a wonderful invention . I get peace of mind and my daughter stay warm all night . I do not have to worry if she kick off she blanket and be cold , I do not worry about a blanket get wrap around she face . all in all I feel really great about the Halo SleepSack . another plus be that it arrive before I expect !
Baby	NEU	3	the picture of this belt on Amazon show pink , white and black stripe , but the version I receive be pink , white and light brown stripe . I email the seller and they offer for I to return it as they do not have a `` black '' version , but that be a hassle . otherwise , the belt seem to be good quality , though the buckle mechanism might be tricky for a toddler to work . we 'll see after she try to use it .
Baby	POS	4	I truly appreciate this playpen since they pay attention to detail but still make sure it be convenient for the mom too . I have c section and this playpen be right for you cause it be not too high for you when you have to bend down to put baby in the playpen . the canopy be something extra that make it look different than other playpen . lot of space to put stuff and diaper storage be useful as well . I really recommend : -rrb- to all mom . very nice playpen and worth all my money i spend .
Baby	NEU	3	these bib be definitely make very cheap . do not expect to last too long . it start fray after the first wash . they be not waterproof as they claim .
Baby	POS	5	as we all know , you be suppose to put you baby to sleep on he back to help prevent sid . the SleepSack be a great product ! it keep baby nice and warm , yet you do not have to worry about a blanket . and there be space down in the bottom for he foot so he be not too restricted . also , the great thing be that it zip from top to bottom , so you do not have a big zipper poke baby in the face .
Baby	POS	5	this be a awesome product . my baby love it from the start . we buy it when he be 2 month & it be very difficult to get he to sleep . he take to it right away . he be 4 month now and love it more than ever . the music be soft and have the perfect volume for he to fall asleep to . the light be just bright enough to light the mobile up so he can see it spin in the dark . it be definitely worth the money . if something happen to this one , I would buy the same one again .
Baby	POS	5	my baby love it . I could not find a single item he like to chew on besides he hand . I be get frustrated . I be so glad I buy this . he love it . he chew on the berry part and the handle . it be perfect size for he to hold . my baby love the pacifier and after I receive this item in the mail I think he might confuse they , but he do not . I be so glad I purchase this item .
Baby	NEU	3	when it be on properly , this cover do not often leak , be a nice color , and fit snuggly . however , by 18-28 lb. , my son be all over velcro like vulture to a carcass and unless the cover be secure under a onesie , and sometimes even then , I will often find the cover and insert down in one pant leg . the velcro do not require a lot of tug to loose , and if a diaper will not stay on , its effectiveness be lose . paired with the price , this cover have become a back-up for I and be a disappointment .
Baby	POS	5	great product , just as describe , make sure you have a really deep spacious change area as it be big , which be not a bad thing . nice and cushy for baby , it come with bolt to bolt it down , which for premy I see no need for , but maybe in the future . I be still think about that , do not know if I want to drill hole in the top of the dresser when it be later go to be use as a toddler dresser . but ... that be say I be very happy with this , glad i do not buy the cheap wal-mart one ... no comparison !!!! I would recommend this to anyone look for a really nice change pad ... and thank you to the seller WOW that be the fstest shipping ... order April 9 , daughter recieve it on the 11th ... she have identical twin girl so it will be get alot of use ...
Baby	POS	4	these wrap be very easy to use with prefold and clean very well in the washer . the only thing I don would like , which be a minor issue , be that the side on the back curl in . this be only a problem if the diaper be not wet or dirty and I just want to change out the prefold . sometimes it will curl in and get dirty . otherwise , I be very happy with these cover .
Baby	NEG	1	after view the picture , I be excite about this baby hat . the pom pom look very cute , and the hat be say to be make of wool . its name also suggest that it be come from Korea . well , after wait for several week , I finally receive a small parcel with the sign `` China Post '' on it . I open it , and there it be . the hat be cover in some white stuff , which I think be some packing fluff at first , but it turn out to be glue fiber . who on earth would glue pom pom on a baby hat ? and glue they so that the glue -lrb- it seem to be the type of glue one would use with a glue gun -rrb- would go through the `` wool '' and actually touch\/scrape the baby 's head ? also , there be nothing here to suggest that it be , indeed , make of wool . I be extremely disappoint in this product and will try to return it , though if I be to pay for return shipping to China , I guess it stay with I . just look at the picture that I take of this hat , and do not bother order it . Update : after contact the company about a refund , I promptly receive they reply with a apology for the low quality of this product , and they refund I money that I pay for the hat -lrb- but not the shipping cost -rrb- .
Baby	POS	5	this sleep nest be perfect for we little one who be too young to pull up she blanket . instead of just kick off a blanket , she stay nice and warm and comfortable in the sleep nest . we love it !
Baby	POS	5	when I be register for my baby shower I see this . it be to cute to take a chance on not get it . so I purchase it myself . it be so cute ! the bunny tail on the back be adorable and there be the cutest little gift tag on it that look like a package of seed . so it would make a great gift to : -rrb-
Baby	POS	4	the boppy be so nice for my newborn to lay on and I could prop he up with it . he love tummy time with it and it work great to have he awake while on it . I know it be a breastfeed pillow but I do not really use it as that very often . I nurse off and on but mostly pump so that be most of it but when I do nurse , it do not seem to help very much with position , etc. . I still think it be a great baby purchase but if you use it simply for nursing , I do not think you will use it much . especially after you get the hang of it , you will not need it anymore . I enjoy this purcahse and would recommend it . great for a 0-6 month old !
Baby	POS	4	these mitten have work out great ! we start use they when we son be around 4 month , and at 5 month they still fit well with room to spare . we do not put they in the dryer , to prevent any shrink issue , so I can not comment on how they would hold up there . the velcro be fantastic at keep the mitten on he hand - he tend to slip right out of other mitten . they look big enough for he to continue wear until he outgrow he scratch issue !
Baby	NEG	1	I wish I have not spend money on these . they be cheap and do not hold up . please save yourself the frustration and buy higher quality bib . these only get 2-3 use . there be nothing water resistant about these .
Baby	POS	5	this outfit be quite a hit at the baby shower ! yes , it a bit large ... but , that be ok ! better too large than too small .
Baby	NEG	2	this come unwrapped in a big Amazon box with other item I order -lrb- book , toy , etc. . . -rrb- unlike the other item the bib be not wrap in plastic or paper to protect it , and it arrive with scratch and scuff mark . in addition , the edge have extra material hang off . I have see this product in physical store , so I will pay a few $ more for one that look new .
Baby	NEU	3	the bib be great to coordinate with you little one outfit , but they be poor in quality . I would not purchase again .
Baby	POS	5	I buy this for my daughter when she be around 6 month old , and she have sleep with it every night since then . it be small , lightweight , and the perfect size for she little hand . besides be about the cutest thing in the world when you see it tuck underneath she arm while she be sleep , it have also save my hair during nursing session . I always have Sweet Pea available when I nurse , and now instead of pull my hair or scratch my face she hand be busy hold and explore she baby . I do like have the outer pea pod for when we travel or take the baby somewhere because it keep the baby cleaner . my daughter be now 11 month old , and she be so attach to she Sweet Pea , that we buy a second one just in case we need a back-up !
Baby	POS	5	my husband and I purchase this item when my daughter be 8 month . we get it to make do daily thing a little easier without worry about she bump she head . we love it . we only use it for a short time a few time a day and it be great ! it make it easier to make dinner . I plop she in it in the kitchen and we hang out while I be cooking . it make it easy to answer the door and not worry while my back be turn for a few seconds . she enjoy it a lot . we put some snack in it and she eat they and play away . I do not know how we do without it !
Baby	POS	5	I have wash they so many time already and they be still in great shape , and they keep the moisture away from my dd chest and cloth .
Baby	POS	5	this teething ring work wonderful it be right at the child level when be hold child gravitate towards it . fit in child 's hand well . it be beautiful and I get lot of commplement on it people do not know it be a teething ring .
Baby	POS	5	we swaddle we baby from birth to about 3 month . he begin to associate the blanket with nap time or bedtime . when he begin roll over , we need a non-swaddling blanket option that would give he the same sleep cue . the HALO sleepsack work great . it be soft and roomy , but we do not worry about he end up with the blanket over he face or in he mouth . the zipper open up from the bottom , which mean there be no uncomfortable zipper up by he chest . there be plenty of grow room -- he be now 7 mo , and still fit in the sleep sack with room to spare . the tag on the back be scratchy , but that can easily be take out .
Baby	NEU	3	I usually love this brand of cover , but for some reason it seen like this one leak right from the beging .
Baby	POS	4	so we just go through colic and the dreaded 4 month sleep regression phase . when we move we baby to she own room around 3 month , we put a floor fan in there for white noise . she wall be right next to we tv room , she brother be next door and a loud 2 year old , and she big window be right on a busy street . and she be never a really good sleeper . while for some baby -lrb- lucky lucky parent -rrb- a sleep machine be all you need - for we we know it be just a stress-reliever for we , so that we would not have to worry that noise be interfere with she sleep . -lrb- we could tick that item off the list and move on . -rrb- the fan be just way too cold . so I purchase the sound machine -lrb- marpac 980a , see other review -rrb- and this sheep . I get this sheep for the car actually , as one other reviewer have mention it help they baby not scream in the carseat . after look at both -lrb- the marpac and the sheep -rrb- - the marpac end up in she room for consistent white noise all night , and the sheep go in the car . I do not want to worry that the timer function be the reason for poor sleep -lrb- ie when she wake up at night , she can not go back to sleep because the sheep be no longer on - tick another thing off the list ! -rrb- the sheep be really soft . unfortunately , the sheep do not keep she from scream in the car seat . however - it be great for I ! it be now in we bedroom , hang next to the bed - and it have be fantastic for I - as sleep deprive as I have be , it be often really hard for I to get back to sleep after get up to feed or tend to she or my son if he be sick and really need I in the middle of the night . have try muscle relaxation , all that other stuff that I usually do not need , but it would not work . have use a sound machine in the past -lrb- not the marpac -rrb- and hate it . the one I have try before all sound tinny or annoyingly inconsistent . the rain setting on this sheep , and the timer be perfect for I - have no trouble fall back to sleep at any time . thank you sleep sheep !!!!!!!
Baby	POS	5	I love , love , love the Summer Infant Bibbity . it catch the mess and be dishwasher safe . I rinse it off during the day and toss it in the dishwasher in the evening . no muss , no fuss . buy it , you 'll like it .
Baby	POS	4	this bib be a good product . keep baby clean from chin to wrist plus , he love the sound it make !!
Baby	NEG	1	I buy this pump because the hospital say it be a great brand to buy . I be ready to throw it out the window . it start out you set you speed which be fine , but then part way through pump it will change the setting on you to either way to hard and it hurt very much , my nipple have come away raw from this dang machine , or it will go too light to the point where no milk even come out . it also do not pump both side equally . it will do the side that I put the main pump on -lrb- the one that you set it with -rrb- really good but then the other side wont hardly do it at all . I can be at 3 ounce on the one side and only have like 1\/2 a ounce on the other . I would never buy this stupid machine again . it be not worth the money !!!! by the way this be Jared 's wife : -rrb-
Baby	POS	5	I have the chalk mat by this company , so I try this apron . another great product that be smart , practical , and beautiful . Easy to wipe down and I do not have to fight with my kid to get they to wear it . another great gift option . we use they for art and craft to cooking to play in the sink with rubber ducky . and of course , it be eco-friendly so totally safe for my kid and the environment .
Baby	NEU	3	the costume be make with nice material . the only downside to it be that the head piece be extremely small . it would fit a baby under 12 lb . I have to have it alter in order for it to fit and unfortunately its still pretty small .
Baby	NEG	1	I have buy 2 of these bib , and have only have a problem with the polka dot pattern one . the instruction say they be machine washable , but the print start come off after I hand wash it with regular dishwashing detergent . then , the wash machine take the rest of the color off the bib . it be effective at keep the baby clean and I be always surprise at how much food be catch in the front pocket , but , for the price , I would expect it to stay look new as well . I have have it replace twice now , and will just get a refund this time . this do not happen with the flower pattern .
Baby	POS	5	these be amazing ! they stay on every second of the day ! I have be wash they every day so we can use they !
Baby	NEG	1	these be def . the worst burp pad I have ever come across . for starter , they be tiny -lrb- not to mention that they also shrink ! -rrb- . secondly , after one wash only , they look as if they have be use a million time . the material be horrible - rough , fade and not smooth - I can not even let my baby put he head over these thing . in all , this be a waste of money and I would stay clear of they .
Baby	POS	5	buy this for we 5 mo old daughter and she love it too ! she even sit in it just to play with a rattle or watch a show . like most child she have a lot of thing and at time we living room look as if she be the only one who live here . so this product be able to store away be excellent and it be safe , roomy and very cute ! not to mention ... the price be excellent too ! really worth the buy ! happy parenting !
Baby	POS	5	definitely worth the inexpensive dollar it cost . help keep carseat in place , as well as protect the seat -- a major bonus . I end up order more for relative ' car !
Baby	POS	4	good price , clean easily , fold and store easily . the tray do not have a lip high enugh to stop food from hit the floor but we just use it as a booster for my 1 and 2 year old .
Baby	POS	4	it have help my son sleep better thru the night and the sound be very soothing .
Baby	POS	4	I like these because my son just pull off the velcro one , but the head hole be really big , so the collar of he shirt can still get dirty easily .
Baby	POS	4	this outfit will shrink some if it be not wash carefully ; so head up on that . other than that ... I know my baby will look completely adorable .
Baby	POS	5	I use it at home and outside . it be somewhat flexible , so I can roll up and stuff it inside my baby 's lunch box . it catch most solid and liquid -lrb- soup -rrb- . but , I have to take it off when my baby want to drink water or milk so that he can place he arm comfortably .
Baby	POS	4	this a very cute pack n ' Play and be very functional and sturdy . it have everything you need to create a mini baby station for change and nap . the only reason I do not give it 4 star be that the change table seem to roll baby a little to one side . it do not seem dangerous , just a little annoying . the nice thing about the change table be that it fold away and be tall -lrb- easier for tall folk to change diaper -rrb- . we find we really do not use the changer as we have a seperate change area that work better for we at home but it would be a nice feature to travel with .
Baby	POS	5	I pick this sleeved bib because it be reasonably price . I already own a bib with sleeve so I know what a great idea this product be and well worth the money . I be curious about how this brand would hold up to the standard . the two bib be well make and large enough to last through toddlerhood . best price for the quality ... worth get !
Baby	POS	4	my 6 month old son seem to enjoy eat with the spoon . he be not of the age to hold they himself and I worry that they may be too heavy and long , but in the meantime he enjoy the color and the tip do not hurt he gum .
Baby	POS	5	I have give Sophie Giraffe as a gift to two different young mother . my granddaughter be impressed that I know about Sophie G. it seem Sophie G be popular among she young mother friend . my granddaughter say that she son , my great grandson , love the toy and he four year old sister like it too . my husband and I be the godparent to my husband 's niece 's daughter who be now marry and just have a baby girl . mother and baby girl be please with Sophie G and Chan Blue . the giraffe toy remind I of my own daughter 's love of a giraffe toy when she be a infant . I recall how easily she hold onto and maneuver the giraffe in she hand bring the toy to she mouth . yes , I do have to keep wash the toy down .
Baby	NEG	2	these be not soft . . also they do not soak properly ... I will not buy these again ... I realize later that since most part of the bib be embroidered , it be not functional as bib as the embroidered part do not soak well . .
Baby	POS	5	this item ship a little slow but be exactly what I want ! the shelf be nice and roomy for storage . the wood be in great condition and I like the wheel . very good look at a great price . if you be look for something moderate then this change table will be perfect !
Baby	POS	5	we little one look very cute with this bib , and we do not have to deal with the stain anymore . we love it !!
Baby	POS	4	I love this sleep sack . I like how large the size be -- great for older baby . the only thing that keep I from give it a 5 star rating be the zipper . I have 2 and both zipper be not the best quality . with that be say , I would still buy another and recommend the product to someone .
Baby	POS	5	I have be use this pump for the past 5 month since I go back to work . the pump work wonderfully . I use it 2 to 3 time a day . Medela also have great customer service !
Baby	NEG	2	I buy these because I want something that look fun and kiddie and they be . just do not expect something big . these be more comparable to face towel and the stitch on the edge could be better . a lot of extra thread that I have to trim . because it be pretty small we use it more as bib when feed we daughter .
Baby	POS	5	I be a mother with 3 young child . my youngest be 8 month old and grab the spoon while I feed he mushy baby food . even though he always wear a bib , he clothes usually still get dirty . I wonder if any bib would actually keep he clothes clean . I have compare the Bumkins Superbib , the Babybjorn bib , the Bibbity bib , and the Bumkins Sleeved bib . with my first child , I quickly realize that use cloth bib and put they in the laundry after each meal be a terrible idea . they would get moldy and I have to own a dozen bib . then I switch to Bumkins Superbibs . they be very easy to use . I just wash they in the sink after meal and hang they on my bib dry rack . the bib be dry and ready to use again by the next meal . Bumkins Superbibs be lightweight and my baby never mind wear they . since the pocket be soft , they do not work well if the bib have be keep flat in a drawer . I always keep my superbib hang upside down by the pocket on the bib dry rack . so , the pocket dry in the open position and work better . my 3 year old daughter love to wear she Bumkins Superbibs and they be great for she but they do not adequately protect my baby who fling oatmeal . both the BabyBjorn and the Bibbity bib be SMALLER than the Bumkins Superbibs . the Babybjorn bib be make of hard plastic -lrb- like a cup -rrb- . it say `` soft '' in the description but that be just nonsense . the bibbity bib be softer , like rubber . the Babybjorn bib be difficult to put on the baby because it be so hard . even the neck strap be make of stiff plastic . I have great difficulty adjust the neck hole because it keep hurt my son 's neck . I never could get the hole small enough to keep food from escape onto the clothes below he chin . plan on baby cry the entire time you be fiddle with this bib . the pocket of the bjorn bib be great and always stay open . however , because the pocket be so rigid , it clash with the tray . my son sit on a chair that clip onto the countertop . the bjorn bib pocket keep get catch under the countertop and then it would yank my son 's neck . he really hate wear this bib . the BabyBjorn bib be super easy to wash in the sink . it be easy to dry with a towel so you do not need a bib dry rack with this bib . the bibbity bib be much better than the BabyBjorn bib . it be softer and feel like rubber . it be awkward to put on at first and my son be mad . however , he get use to it . I be able to get the neck hole small enough to keep most of the oatmeal out without hurt my son 's neck . the pocket stay open pretty well . the pocket do work better than the Bumkins Superbib pocket . the bibbity bib be about 1 inch shorter than the Bjorn bib and be 2.5 inch shorter than the Bumkins Superbib . so , some food still end up on the child 's lap . the bibbity bib be very easy to wash in the sink and dry with a towel . I think the bibbity bib work a little better than the Bumkins Superbib overall because the pocket catch more . however , my 3 year old daughter refuse to wear the bibbity bib , and say it hurt she neck . she love to wear she Bumkins Superbibs . UPDATE : now my son be 13 month old and refuse to wear the bibbity bib at all . it be too heavy and uncomfortable . unfortunately , all 3 of these bib leave way too much food spill on my 8 month old 's clothes . if you have a baby who eat mushy baby food and grab the spoon , a regular bib just do not give adequate protection . so , I buy the Bumkins sleeve bib . it be great ! it cover everything , even he lap ! he could feed himself oatmeal and he clothes be very clean afterward ! the sleeved bib be very easy to clean too . I just wash it off in the kitchen sink and hang it on my bib dry rack -lrb- which sit next to my kitchen sink -rrb- . the sleeved bib go from drip wet to completely dry in 2 hour . since , the bib dry fast , I use the same sleeved bib at each meal . this way I only have to buy one . in conclusion , I recommend the Bumkins sleeve bib for any baby who eat pureed food . when they start on finger food and become a little neater , the Bumkins Superbibs and the Bibbity bib be good . the bibbity work a little better than the Bumkins Superbib but you child might think they be uncomfortable . I do not recommend the Babybjorn bib . sorry , Babybjorn . I love to wear my baby in you carrier : -rrb- UPDATE : my son be now 13 month old . he refuse to wear the bibbity bib at all . he also pull off he Bumkins Superbibs , throw they on the floor , and laugh . I put he in the Bumkins sleeve bib for every meal . he do not mind wear it and he can not get it off . it also do the best job of keep he clean . I wash it in the sink after meal and hang it on the bib dry rack . it dry in about 2 hour . I use the same bib all the time . I put it in the laundry every few day . here be a link to the dry rack I be talk about  Mommy genius dry rack -- Dry or Display just about anything -lrb- Baby Bibs , Plastic or Reusable Food Storage Bags , kitchen Dish Towels , Bathroom Hand Towels , Washcloths , Mugs , Sports Water Bottles , Herbs , Mittens , Children 's Boots , Lingerie , Holiday Orname ...
Baby	POS	5	I absolutely love this dress table . although I would have prefer something with drawer -lrb- which I would get when my baby be older -rrb- , this come in handy and do a good job of keep mommy organize . the change pad be thin , but it do not bother I or the baby . of all the baby item I plan to give away , this be one that I would be keep .
Baby	POS	5	they match my nojo butterfly ensemble that be my nursery theme . Super absorbent . Modern and chic baby look . I love polka dot for girl so this be too cute . they look expensive but be a great price .
Baby	NEG	1	this bib be WAY rougher than it look ... almost feel like someone go over the fabric with a knife and make it shabby ... in the picture it look like it be a sort of spandex or wetsuit fabric which be what i be expect . for the price , i wouldnt recommend to anyone . im return this on Monday
Baby	POS	4	this be a tough decision for I . I absolutely love the color and design of this outfit ; however , the material be a bit thin . so ... 5 star for the adorable factor and 3 star for material grade . overall score ... 4 Stars . I opt to hang dry this one . if I do throw it into the dryer , I will turn inside out and dry on lowest temperature to preserve the bright color .
Baby	POS	5	Minor Cons : - slightly time-consuming to wash multiple piece . - bottle always leak for I , I personally have to use another brand for feeding -lrb- Tommee Tippee be exceptional for combine breast and bottle -rrb- . - the bottle-pump be top-heavy and fall over if you be not careful , and can leak a little when on they side . - a little milk get under the ` petal ' and can occasionally be slightly messy . pro : - Super comfortable !!!! - Super fast ! - Super suction -lrb- but you 'll hardly feel it -rrb- ! easily compare to the hospital grade pump I use , but without the discomfort . - infinite personalized variety in speed , rhythm , and suction intensity . I can change the variable as often as I want throughout the pump session so that it remain comfortable and can be match to the change of my flow . - double my output in half the time over my manual pump . - the \* only \* pump I would ever want to use multiple time daily . it be just so entirely comfortable and fast . the other pump -lrb- even the hospital one -rrb- make I slightly sore and make pump a burden , especially the more frequently I use they . - one reviewer say it do not work with very large nipple . I have find this to be untrue , you just have to be more careful with the placement and wet you breast first with a little milk to make it easier for they to slide into the funnel . but it do work .
Baby	POS	5	I wait a really long time to buy this because it feel like a lot of money to pay for a smock . I regret wait at all . it make feed time infinitely easier - I do not have to completely strip down my toddler anymore or spend hour try to clean out stain . it be long enough to cover he lap beyond the highchair tray -lrb- if you do not use a tray , part of the leg will still be expose for spill -rrb- . the neck be high enough to cover he collar which use to get hit even with a bib . it be really easy to clean , and I be no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy , stain food ! it be completely worth it and I wish I would have it since he start solid . later edit : we have now have this smock for about 2 year and it be barely show sign of wear . I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meal . the best way to get it clean be to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair . it will dry extremely fast and get really clean . if you do not turn it inside out , the sleeve have a hard time dry on the inside where the absorbent fabric be . we love this smock and just order a second one for my daughter .
Baby	POS	4	the Gerber mitten you find in the store be too short and the wrist be too big . these give my son freedom to move he finger but do not fall off like the other . the wrist size be perfect and the fabric softness and thickness be great . my only complaint be that for something so simple and easy to make , they be not finish well . the serger string where just hang out . I tuck they in myself , fear that otherwise they could unravel . anyone with a serger could easily make these , but with a baby and another child keep I busy , I do not want to take the time -lrb- especially at this price point -rrb- . oh , and one of my bow fall off the first time they be worn , so we 'll see how they hold up .
Baby	NEU	3	the only reason I be give this product 3 star be for the simple face that it be cute & unique . however , the material its make out of should have be advertise differently . I expect it to be harder , like a teether usually be . this teether feel like a generic dog toy that you can pick up at some dollar store . we buy they for we dog all of the time b\/c he actually enjoy tear they up & its easy for he & cheap for we . when I open the package I be greatly disappointed . plus it have a squeaker ! even worse when it be just like the toy you buy you pet . we dog be so excited & I be afraid when we daughter start to use this it 'll become a dog toy the second she drop it ! it cost way to much for what it actually be . so do the other teether sell by this company . they be all cute over price dog toy . : -lrb-
Baby	NEG	1	absolutely awful ! I buy these because I could not find anymore at the store . I love the design ; it be cute and not full of today awful cartoon character . I even think it be nice that I get 8 bib instead of 6 . after one wash , 4 of the bib be rip at the neck line . and 1 completely destroy . I never even get to use they . I be highly disappointed !!
Bag	POS	4	if you want a basic camera that can zoom and have multiple auto-everything feature , this little film camera may be good for you . it be easy for I to carry around when I do not have room for a slr -lrb- single lens reflex -rrb- camera . take decent picture with 400 iso film , but light need to be pretty darn good daylight lighting for the pix to look swell . since purchase this little baby , Minolta go out of the camera business in the mid 2000s . the Freedom zoom 160 come out , I believe , in 2002 , one of the last film point & shoot camera . now I have a digital point & shoot with video capability and a Pentax K-x DSLR that I use for serious photography . but for a back-up camera , the Minolta can not be beat .
Bag	POS	4	well , like my title say , this bag be perfect for my little Fuji digital . I be able to throw in 2 set of battery in the side pocket , carry my wallet and cell in the front zip , the camera in the middle , and a extra memory card .  my only complaint about this bag be the lack of stability in the middle . unless you very careful , with a lot of bumping , I think the camera would get damage = not a good thing . but overall , if you need a quick , down and dirty bag , this be pretty darn good . for the money , it be worth it .
Bag	POS	4	for the extension cord , this replace the rip shopping bag I have be pile they into . it also keep they cleaner and encourage you to roll they properly ... once that be do , it be painfully obvious . for those of you with jumper cable float around the back of the truck , this solve that a give you a clean , safe and memorable place for the flashlight , etc. .  great practical gift that nobody have and everyone will appreciate .
Bag	POS	4	this camera bag be great . it be big enough to hold 2 body , and several lens ; yet the bag remain light weight . it also have plenty of storage compartment for extra gear and film .
Bag	POS	5	not quite as big as I expect it to be , I almost wish i would have shell out the extra buck for the pro 12 to get a little extra comfort room in the big internal pouch . but , I do not think it would have be worth it a extra $ 40-50 for that little extra room . nevertheless this be a excellent bag and it be actually probably better that I go with the pro 8 instead of the 12 . it be big enough to fit it all , but small enough to carry it around everywhere and not be too much . this bag be definitely well build and durable , ready to take on the winter month come up with its total coverage top , 4 clip , a zipper and velcro to keep the top secure . the inside be nice with the divider and ton of velcro for maximum personalization to any gear you have . ton of pouch , pocket and slot for all that little stuff from memory card slot to cable , cord , cell phone or anything you can think of . so in this nice roomy little bag I manage to fit : - Stroboframe bracket -lrb- tight fit tho -rrb- - Olympus E-510 Dslr w \/ 14-42mm and hood attach -lrb- and strap -rrb- - Canon rebel 2000 film slr w \/ 28-80mm attach -lrb- and strap -rrb- -40 -150 mm lens w \/ hood - fl-50 ttl flash -2 nd manual flash - Portable Hard drive -1 Wireless flash trigger and 2 receiver - cable and cord - memory card , film and any other little thing like lens cap . - small tripod - plus plenty of room for little stuff leave in the pocket and pouch the only thing I have find be that this bag be slightly different from the description in that they must have come out with a newer model that do not have the detachable film bag , but do have red flag for memory card slot , check the Tamrac site for the correct version\/photo . overall it be a excellent bag and I be very pleased with it .
Bag	POS	4	Works on the deck great with 36 grit paper . however , the dustless feature seem to have be ommit in the one I receive . borrow a Porter Cable with a more effective collection system and in retrospect think the more expensive Bosch would have be a better investment . otherwise easy machine , good value .
Bag	NEU	3	the bag be make of heavy rip-stop nylon that will probably outlast I . I do not use this professionally , but I always have a lot of project in my `` off '' hour . the bag have many nice pocket -lrb- though I do not find they very useful in practice -rrb- and a sturdy zipper . the big downside be that there be no stiff bottom in this bag , unlike every other bag I have use . tool all slump to a heap in the center . I 'll cut my own , but I should not have to . a minor complaint be that the handle be just a nylon strap . I much prefer the feel of the nylon strap on the ` ridgid ' brand bag which have a stiff cord in the strap . hard to describe , but it be a nice feel . Ridgid have a nice 22 '' and a nice 17 '' . if you like a small bag , Stanley have a nice 12 '' .
Bag	POS	5	Great little camera bag for the Pentax EI-200 & HP-618i . have a tough time find a camera bag that meet my need , and the Lowepro website do a fantastic job of provide a list of compatible camera for each bag . check it out !
Bag	POS	5	this spacious tool bag be wonderful and so roomy that I wish I have buy two of they . I definitely recommend this tool bag .
Bag	POS	5	one year of very hard use and it be just as good as new ... just have a whole lot of character mark now . I be back to buy another , really like the soft bag for my tool . if it can take a year of my daily abuse , it be a great bag . .
Bag	POS	5	before I retire , I use one of these in my job for many year . the material for the bag be super-tough Cordura nylon . externally , the many different size pocket neatly store the most used tool for quick access , while internally , the bag have more vary size pocket on both side and on the end , keep all the tool require by electrical or mechanical tech organize and neat for ready access . the size of the bag be just right , IMO , for technician keep mechanical and electrical system in good work order . meter and other misc tool go in the center of the bag , and it be not heavy at all when fill . this bag become standard issue for all the other tech in the plant , it be fit and function perfect for we job . Quality be top notch . so it stand to reason that when I retire , I buy a new one for home use , it be a attachment I can not do without . there be a smaller one , but it be too small for the various tool and meter require by electromechanical technician , and the next size up , while have the same organizational attribute , become too heavy and bulky for people walk to problem in a manufacturing environment . it be the perfect size in we opinion .
Bag	POS	5	not too big , not too small ... just the right size for my dslr , a rather large flash , three extra battery and memory card , and three lens . the bag be well design to protect you camera against rain and bumping . the camera body with lens attach be design to sit on the left side center with the lens run down the middle - the bag 's design be flexible enough to support short stubby lens or the longer telephoto lens . there be two accessory pouch with one up front for battery and memory card and the other up on the cover for anything else . I put my cable , tool , and cleaning cloth up there . the top secure with three rather large strap clip and it come with a nice shoulder strap . there be strap on the left and right which accept accessory pouch from the Tamrac MX line . the fit and finish seem top rate and worthy of year and year worth of service .
Bag	POS	4	this bag seem well construct and look like it will last awhile . the Pentax K100D Super w\/18 -55 mm lens fit fine and the storage pouch will fit extra battery , memory card and some lens filter & clean item perhaps . will not take much more than that . I would like to have see a little more padding throughout but I be very pleased with it anyway .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be so great , I already love it . it be great for carry stuff between work and home , perfect for travel , too . it be strong and sturdy enough to withstand the rigor of everyday use , but it look hip and go with everything . how do I ever manage without my Amazon messenger bag ?
Bag	POS	4	this bag hold my Nikon d40 with 18-55 DX lens with room for a handful of accessory -lrb- battery charger + spare battery and power cord ; usb cable ; lens\/body cap ; uv filter case -rrb- . I find it difficult to position the padding perfectly for the d40 , so the divider do not quite cradle the camera . however , all of the accessory that I find some need for have when I be not at home fit just fine in the bag , and none of the pocket be completely fill . also , there do not seem to be a perfect corner for tuck in the neck strap - I always end up folding it in some wierd position . I do not see much of a good way to fit another lens inside - but hopefully by the time I can afford more glass , I 'll have enough cash for a slightly larger bag too . I have not have a oppurtunity to test the aw -lrb- all weather -rrb- cover yet . however , while not in use , you can barely tell it exist . for soem reason , the price go up since I buy it - it be $ 18.33 at the time of purchase , but two week later , it be go for $ 23.40 . also , I do not see why other color be more expensive - the black one be about ten buck more .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this so that I could put the most commonly use tool I have in one easy to pick up and go container . Works like a charm . I want to buy another Bucket Boss , so that I can store all my most frequently use part -lrb- screw , razor blade , nut , bolt , etc. -rrb-
Bag	POS	5	I give my dad one of these a year ago , and he have give it a workout . I think the company must have read the earlier review , and improve the strength of the bag . Dad have overload he with drill , etc. , and carry it everyplace , and it be show no sign of wear . he be so hard to buy for , it be great to see he thoroughly enjoy it . I be look for something similar but smaller to give he this year for he smaller item .
Bag	NEU	3	as mention in another review , the bag be a good bag . it be lighter than the McGuire Nicholas 24 '' bag , but it have only 3 covered pocket . first , the bag be a good bag . quite large . see product description for actual measurement . it have 3 covered exterior pocket with velcro secure they . 3 open fact pocket on the other side . on the interior , there be pocket on only one side , and they be flat-sewn to the backing . there be no bellowing or gusset . second , compare to the Mcguire 24 '' comparable model , the bucket boss be a little smaller , but lighter . the biggest difference be that the McGuire have more and larger interior pocket , 3 more covered exterior pocket , and be 10 $ cheaper .
Bag	POS	5	I have be use the dust bag for a week now and it work . be it a dust elimination system , no. . but it do cut down on my clean up by 95 % . not bad for a $ 13 item . I could not see run my table see without it .
Bag	NEU	3	fine bag . hold my Olympus d-460 -lrb- and manual -rrb- , 4 extra smart card , 8 aa battery , my kodak photolife k1000 aa battery charge kit , various cable , and FlashPath 3.5 ' floppy adaptor with ease .
Bag	POS	5	well finish , balanced , beauty ... a very very nice camera bag . I be not fond of back-pack or kangaroo pouch for carry my photo gear . I prefer the classic , standard , shoulder-hanged bag . I particularly feel this one as a very safe and rugged one . you 'll find enough space in it to accomodate body , lens , flash , and several minor gadget . side-slip pocket be a real hit , very handy indeed .
Bag	POS	4	I live in NYC and have a ton of gadget , very hard to find in a regular bag . THis be pretty cool , since you kinda compartmentize everything and its convenient to find the stuff you need .
Bag	POS	5	I go to a few privately own camera store -- very overpriced for what they be offer . the Samsonite camera bag be tough , durable , and SPACIOUS . I carry a flash , two lens , along with my canon elan 7 , and I have ton of room to grow , which be what I want . very reasonably price and well-made . I be pleased with my purchase .
Bag	POS	4	I be really hope this bag would help collect some of my sawdust . after a week of use it about two inch of dust have accumulate in the bag . actually most of the dust blow out of every other opening in my bosch saw . the bag seem to catch bigger shaving . I have not be saw any mdf or fine dust produce material so it may help more with those . the problem seem that all the shaving keep clog up in my dust port . on the plus side the bag have a squeeze clamp on it so it will work on just about anything .
Bag	POS	5	this bag do just what I need - clean up my trunk . I have cable , fix-a-flat , screwdriver and everything else roll around in my car and stash where I could fit they -lrb- but still could not be find when need -rrb- . now everything fit in this bag and look great . I be go to get one for my other car . highly recommend .
Bag	NEU	3	I guess the product do exactly what it say . it hold jumper cable . and that be it . I be hope to have some extra space in the bag to put other thing , and make use of the little front pocket , but it really be too small to be of much use . but as a bag to put jumper cable in , it work great . just like a plastic bag from WalMart would . get it on sale , and maybe it be worth it . otherwise , I would pass on this .
Bag	POS	5	I have use this model sander for year and like it because it be light weight , powerful , and do not wear you out like a heavier sander . its handle be arrange to give it a low center of gravity . this make it easier to control . the graphite impregnate friction pad that the belt run over be readily available from Bosch , be inexpensive and very easy to change . this product arrive as promise and be well package to prevent damage in shipping .
Bag	POS	5	I already have the smaller version of this bag but it be time to move up a little . I have a larger Tamrac backpack bag I use everyday , but do not have room for my `` strobist '' gear . I can fit 4 sb900 speedlight with some smaller modifier plus a few Justin clamp in the bag , along with a few other odds and end . I toss this in the back seat of my truck to have what I need in a hurry without weigh down my regular bag , kind of a second bag for I . I be not fond of a regular bag for everyday use , much prefer my backpack style bag . my only complaint be that I wish it be bigger , but that be my mistake in order , not they fault .
Bag	POS	5	nice leather ! really soft ! even so you use DSLR , you can place it easyly . I love it !!
Bag	POS	5	this thing be great , and be less than half the price of a bag that Sony be sell with my camcorder . fit my dcr-sr300 perfectly with all its accessory . save yourself a few buck and go with Samsonite .
Bag	POS	5	this camera bag be a must have !!! it be roomy and very well design . highly recommend !!!
Bag	POS	5	I use this bag to house my Dewalt D51822 clip Head Framing nailer . other have complain about how they nailer fit in this bag , but my Dewalt fit great with a little room to spare . the material be strong and do not seem like it will rip , tear , or fray easily . the zipper and other hardware ar extremely tough and will probably last a life time . the bottom of the bag be semi-rigid and offer extra protection when it be place on the ground .
Bag	POS	5	this be the best camera bag I have purchase , especially since it have the quality of any other Case Logic product , superb !  i own a old Toshiba pdrm1 digital camera , and in this neat little bag , there be a protected pouch for the camera , two storage area for digital media , and a storage for 4-aa -lrb- or aaa -rrb- battery .  I think this bag be super convenient , since I can carry my extra SmartMedia card and spare 4-aa battery . the size of the bag be small enough to fit in my travel bag , but yet , have a lot of storage space for all the necessity of a digital camera .  i highly recommend for a small digital camera like my Toshiba pdrm1 . dimension of my camera : 4-3\/4 '' long by 3-1\/4 '' high by 1-1\/2 '' deep . this camera be a perfect fit for this particular bag .
Bag	POS	5	it be good and very easy to handle ! you can put anything from a pda to a camera in it ! it also look nice and be protective of what be inside . the Koskin look also a lot like leather and be a investment well spend .
Bag	POS	5	I be unsure that this case would fit my Sony Mavica fd90 because the only dimension I could find be a little smaller than the camera . I order it anyway as a carry case for the camera and a few floppy just on short trip , instead of the case in which I carry all the cable , battery charger , etc. . this case be perfect even if a little snug because of the lens protrude . the inside pocket give great protection for the camera , and the zip-down front be perfect for the floppy , and maybe even a extra battery ... or a personal item or two . I be glad I trust -lrb- the website -rrb- ... to come through again . they be right as always .
Bag	POS	5	-lrb- this be a update to the review I post below . after several month of use , I be have a problem with the waste port ... the path that clear the dust from the surface to the bag . basically , it be get clogged and while this do not prevent the sander from work , it do prevent dust collection . clean the port be a pain , I have to disassemble the motor cover and use a very small screwdriver to push the clog out . -rrb-  i really like this sander , but I can not comment on long term durability as I have only use it for about a month . nonetheless , Bosch 's reputation for build high quality power tool be pretty solid .  the belt alignment on this be pretty much maintenance free , I have not have to adjust it yet . the overall design be outstanding , easy to use with one hand when you need to , and have good grip for when you need to bear down .  the other aspect of the design that be top be that you can easily get into tight spot . the motor housing do not extend past the right side of the sander . the variable speed switch be nice , and it have a wheel to modulate the top speed -lrb- a higher speed would be nice , I think this be 1,400 feet\/sec -rrb- .  the sander really be `` almost dust free '' , just depend on what you be sand . the dust bag be the only negative , it be small and need to be empty a lot . but after look at it , it probably would not be a big deal to retrofit another bag .  Bosch 's 4x24 sander be also really nice , but it weigh 14 lb . the 3x21 sander be perfect for most job .
Bag	POS	4	I own a Sony Digital8 camera , and this bag hold it perfectly . it be well-constructed , and the pocket hold extra tape and battery , wire , etc. , with some room to spare . while I be happy with this purchase , I would consider spend extra money for the crinkle nylon version -- the Micro Fiber be sturdy , but not as plush as the nylon .
Bag	NEG	1	so far as I can tell , there be no problem with the camera case , but it be too big for the PowerShot s100 , and not big enough to hold the camera and charger . I be return one I recieve as a gift -- this could be the perfect case for another camera .
Bag	POS	4	I buy this case as a accessory to my HP 315 PhotoSmart digital camera . I like the camera very much so it may be bias my view of the bag , but here go :  I like the bag . it be attractive to look at . it be a bit big for the camera I buy , but too big be better than too small !  it be get one main pouch that be very large and I use it to hold my camera and all my cord .  it have a shoulder strap that I do not like -lrb- because it make I look like a tourist -rrb- .  overall it be a very good bag , if a little large with a ugly shoulder strap .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be top-notch in it be construction and feature ... truly functional with space for everything I carry during the day . my only dislike be that the padded section -lrb- for a laptop computer -rrb- be only pad on 3 side , leave one entire side of the computer unprotect . a relatively small problem in a otherwise great bag .
Bag	POS	5	I have burn my way through several beltsander , and actually this be the second Makita belt sander I have own . this sander be a workhorse ... you can use it all day , and it be still ready for more ! it be one of the quietest sander I have own -lrb- although none of they can truely be call `` qiuet '' -rrb- . but , my favorite feature of this sander be its ability to lay flat when it be turn upside down -lrb- this way it can be use as a temporary stationary sander -rrb- .
Bag	NEU	3	it be realy a nice bag however it to small for every thing to fit in if you have load of accesory to fit in
Bag	NEU	3	I have own a number of bucketboss product and I generally like they . this item be just on the ok side . it be make of the same material as other Gatemouth bag so it be pretty tough , but it be functionality be low for I . it do not have enough pocket and the one it have be not all that big . even the main compartment seem small , I can not fit my drill in there , much less charger and battery . this bag do not come with a strap or even hook to fit a strap on it . grant , I should have study the picture closer which do not show any of these . this be not the bag for carry around too long . if you need a bag to put small tool in for home repair , this be the one for you . for anything else , upgrade .
Bag	POS	4	I order this without think much about how much help it would be . I have only use it a few time , but already I can see that I 'll do as the other contractor\/reviewer say and buy several for different type of job . this first one be hold assorted screw , bit , bit holder , tape measure , etc. so that when I be start work , I do not have to search through box and bottle for the thing I 'll need ... I just grab the bag and go . I carry it by the outer string rather than the loop handle in the middle and this pull the top tight so nothing be likely to spill unless I drop it . I like it ! good purchase .
Bag	NEG	2	please pay attention to the one to three star rating . this dust collection bag only capture 50 % or less of the dust come off the Bosch table see . it be not really worth the money . the table see just do not build up enough air pressure to force much of the dust into the bag . a much better , although more expensive , solution be a shop vacuum connect to  the dust Deputy   the dust Deputy  great combination and a much cleaner work shop .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this bag specifically to enter my first pro game stadium at Qwest Field in Seattle because of they bag size restriction . it hold everything and more . it hold my Sony alpha 300 with stock lens , telephoto lens , Sony Cybershot , waterproof case for Cybershot , wide angle , extra battery , filter , memory card and my hd camcorder which I leave at the hotel since the stadium do not allow video recording . oh yeah and a microfiber hand towel . I also take it out in Portland during a steady drizzle of rain and my equipment be not even touch . I think the bag do come with a rain cover but it do not - no biggie as I do not intend to carry it out in the rain anyways . it do get a tad heavy if you load it up and I wish it be juuust a bit contoured so when you have it on you hip it do not sit so awkwardly but overall it be a great bag if you intention be to carry all you gear .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for the back of my suv . I have two 50-foot extension cord and a 25-foot bounce around in a box , and when I see this I could not resist . pro : Quality : the fabric and the stitch look awesome . con : size ... if anything it be on the small side , which could be good , because it could easily fit under the driver 's seat in a truck or van . but I do not even try put the second 50-ft cord in after I have the first one and the 25-foot cord in there and snug -lrb- both be 14 awg -rrb- . I would buy it again , and I would rather buy two than a large bulky one -lrb- multiple cord get heavy fast -rrb- . thus I think it deserve five star , even though it be smaller than what I be originally look for .
Bag	NEU	3	this bag be a good size for my Panasonic Palmcorder . hold the camera , a few tape , the instruction booklet , and a spare battery . just not enough room to really fit the charger . overall , though , it meet my expectation and I feel it be worth it .
Bag	POS	5	I be very pleased with this product . it be as advertise . well make , well think out , sturdy and good color for a man . Bucket Boss have do a good job of see a need and fill it . this make a excellent gift .
Bag	POS	5	for the price , this product be great . it collect 80-90 % of the sawdust and be easy to empty . what more could you ask for ?
Bag	NEG	2	this bag appear to be very durable and have ample space for storage . the problem be access the storage area at the bottom of the bag . in order to get to the storage area in the bottom of the bag you have to remove everything from the top . we return the bag for this reason . this bag would have be perfect if there be a zipper access along the base that open up the bottom storage area for easy access .
Bag	POS	4	this tote make lug around a etx90 spot scope much easier . there be one internal compartment and a zippered internal pocket . there be enough room for the etx90 and a few accessory . just don ' r forget to bring you tripod ...
Bag	NEG	2	this bag have enough space for still , video camera , a small compact tripod , power charge cord and all other cord , minus dv . however the outer look and quality of the bag be same as any other bag which you can buy under $ 10 . Bieng samsonite brand I have expect to have outstanding look and outer finish . however it be just a ordinary quality bag which you can pick up in wall mart for lot less price .
Bag	POS	5	that be right folk , this bag be in fact better than those make by Canon . I recently purchase a Canon a20 digicam as a backup for my Canon S100 Elph . both be excellent cam . I buy the Canon PSC100 bag for the Elph , and though it fit like a glove , and retain the slick elph form , it have no protection , little storage space , or extra . if you drop the bag , even on the carpet , you be do for . and do I mention there be no special cloth material to protect the lcd screen ?  now for the LowePro bag . this baby 's awesome ! it have enough compartment to store 8 extra aa battery & 1 extra cf card , or 4 extra aa battery & 3 extra cf card . plus , the material hug the digicam 's very plush , create a warm and protective feeling . and there be also something special in the back . you can actually pull out a nylon hood to cover the bag on a rainy day . they think of everything . excellent work LowePro .  highly recommend for any digicam ... just find one that fit you cam 's dimension .
Bag	POS	5	I have only use it a couple of time to remove material from door bottom so as to clear new carpeting . work great ! light weight , easy to handle with good feel . do not gouge . dust catcher be good - not great . I would definitely recommend base on my limited use to date .
Bag	POS	5	this product be of very impressive quality and the price be certainly right . its designer obviously put a lot of time and think into the final product . I have no idea that I could put it to so many productive use . this be a winner !
Bag	POS	4	this be my first belt sander and I buy it because I need to refinish some walnut paneling . it make strip old finish a breeze ! I have even use it to edge plane some rough cut cherry face frame stock with good success -lrb- use a Klingspor planer belt -rrb- . change belt be easy , and the auto-tracking mechanism work well . I also find the speed control to be really useful . like other I find the dust port to be on the wrong side of the tool , and it have be difficult try to find a adapter to my vaccum that work well .
Bag	POS	4	I have a digital camera that have a large zoom lens . this bag accomodate it and other accessory , memory and gadget quite well . the outboard zipper pocket allow for other personal effect to be stow away and safe . Perfect for travel or a photo shoot . not to big or small . the leather like surface can receive rough handling without fall apart . at approx -lrb- price -rrb- it be be very good deal .
Bag	POS	5	the interior of Lowepro D-Res 10 AW be make of soft fabric that form a thick cushion to protect digital camera . the exterior be strong and durable . the hidden jacket at the bottom of the bag could be pull out to cover the bag for water-proof purpose . its easy attachment to the belt do not require take off of the belt in order to mount the bag on the waist . as of the size , it fit a Canon s20 perfectly with a side slot that hold up to 2 li-ion battery and a front pocket that hold one cf card . bottom line : I feel safe to put my digital camera in this bag .
Bag	POS	5	I like this belt sander because it have good power output , and be very trim for sand item in place . also it be build to sand very close to the nose as you can remove the front grip . this sander be also easy to hold onto in awkward position , and be very streamlined . I have own more than one of this same model , and I would buy another for theese same reason . I have also find they to be very durable .
Bag	NEU	3	this product , I think , be fairly ok . it only have room for 1 roll of film and it doesnt have a lot of padding if it fall . but the perk be it have a cool sleek design to it but it be what be on the inside that count .
Bag	POS	5	I really like this bag but be very worried about how my camera would fit -lrb- Canon s110 -rrb- in the bag . I be do a lot of comparison shopping on-line and even use the Lowepro Matrix -lrb- a list of all Lowepro bag and which camera fit best in they -rrb- and they recommend the d-res 10 aw . I find that place my camera in vertically give it too much space to jostle around . place it in the other way give a snugger fit , but now there be a gap between the top of the camera and the bag . the `` gap '' will accommodate 2 cf card with case and the pouch , a battery , give that configuration .  those with compact camera such as mine should consider look at the d-re 8 model . it be more compact , cheaper , although it do not have the all weatherproof cover to pull over the case like the d-re 10 .  i also recommend store the desiccant in the case to avoid moisture ruin you camera . you can just pop they in the oven when they have absorb too much moisture to redry they so that they can be reuse .  overall , I think the bag be a fine product . just make sure you visit a store to find the best fit with you equipment and accessory .
Bag	NEU	3	this work ok , but I have not test it against hook up my shop vac since I can ' t find a adapter for my ridgid vac . I wish they have design the bag 4 inch shorter . when I fold up the gravity stand , the bag hang down and get catch up in the wheel . more than once , I fold the bag over the rod to roll the stand around , forget to unfold it and then use the saw . the bottom port fill up quickly and then really throw the dust back up through the blade area .
Bag	POS	4	do not plan to keep battery or lens along with you camera in this bag . so tight , sometimes camera switch turn on when you insert camera in bag . Adequate if no accessory . weather protection cover a big plus in the rain .
Bag	POS	5	I have give this sander limited use so far , but it have perform flawlessly . Belt track nicely without need adjustment , and the sander be light and easy to control . it work very nicely for the first project -lrb- shape the edge of a culture marble shower wall -rrb- .
Bag	NEG	1	this bagger be worthless uless you want a lot of dust and debree in you workshop -lrb- and lung -rrb- -- it collect almost nothing . hook a ShopVac to the exhaust of you table saw .
Bag	NEG	1	it be so unbalanced ... it will turn on its head whenever a cam-body be inside ... . I use with a k7 , and crack it because of the really bad balance of this package ... warning : do not buy it !
Bag	POS	5	great bag for the money . seem to be robust construction and lot of little pocket . the internal divider be simple , adjustable and sturdy . the velcro-closure pocket be only on one side of the bag . the other side be just simple , open-top pocket .
Bag	POS	5	cable fit easily in bag , very tough material , even put a few tool in the bag , screw driver , wrench , channel lock and such .
Bag	POS	5	this be a excellent tool that fit comfortably in you hand . it remove material efficiently and be easy to control . the belt tracking system work better than any other I have use . since it be light weight -lrb- for a belt sander -rrb- , it will not wear you out like most other unit . the inline design allow you to easily get into tight space and unlike many sander , the dust collection system really work . it be make in Switzerland and the result quality be obvious .
Bag	POS	4	Perfect size for a slr and one or two lens or a lens and flash . my favorite feature be the pull out cf card holder . I have use this bag for over a year with no complaint .
Bag	POS	5	this camera bag be exactly what I be look for . it have plenty of room for the camera and lens as well as plenty of storage space .
Bag	POS	5	here be the deal , this be a table saw . it make sawdust . the hole on the back by the power cord be a sawdust exhaust port . if you have a dust collector , by all means plug a vacuum hose into that port and it may even collect all the dust . I do not have a dust collector , this mean the exhaust port throw sawdust a good 7 foot or so out the back of the saw . add this collector bag now mean I only have to sweep up directly under the saw , not under the saw and a arc 7 foot out away from the saw . to I it be absolutely worth it , but it will not replace a several hundred or thousand dollar dust collection system .
Bag	POS	5	if you be a person who like to have the basics in you car , this be a great product . I always have jumper cable -lrb- some of you call they `` booster cable '' -rrb- in every car I own . I have drag old cable from one car to the next as I have buy and sell car over the year . this bag keep the cable orderly and protected , as well as protect you car 's interior from the end clamp and dirt on the cable . it be easy to grab and find you cable when need , and the bag be big enough to throw-in a flashlight as well . you know you need a flashlight because it seem jumper cable be most need at night . I have 3 car , and one of they just go to my newly-licensed son . it be not the greatest gift he ever recieve , but he sure appreciate have a bag of cable in he trunk rather than cable just float around in there .
Bag	POS	5	this be a great quality bag if you can get it for under ten dollar . nice , light-weight , utility bag .
Bag	POS	5	my dog be 10 , so I have have the opportunity to try lot of different bag . there be the best . they look good -lrb- in that you can not see anything when fill ! -rrb- , they be easy to open , and I love the extra lining at the bottom . I also really appreciate that they be biodegradable . one large box last I about 5 month . I have never have a problem with they be weak or degrading before they time .
Bag	POS	5	I receive my Bucket Boss Bag about a month ago and be use it to keep my drill all in one place along with the bit and charger . it work very well and and I well pleased with this bag .
Bag	POS	5	it be always a pleasure to use a well design product . the 1274dv be such a product . the belt change be a snap ; pull the lever back , install the belt , push the lever back . Belt tracking adjustment be easy and stay put . the front grip come off and allow sand in tight place . I have develop `` tennis elbow '' and this sander 's light weight help : 7lb vs. pc 's highly rate weight of 13 . when you use a sander vertically or overhead , that make a big difference . the speed control be simple to adjust , and be variable by the amount of tension place on the trigger . even if you have it set to max speed , by not pull the trigger all the way , the speed will be less than max . the sander be make in Switzerland , and this have to be better than China . this sander feel great out of the box , sand flat and I highly recommend it .
Bag	NEU	3	I return the bag because it be too small for my camera and accessory . I purchase a larger bag from you .
Bag	POS	5	Quality 's a + , get it cheaper than advertise elsewhere and the most convenient ever to carry my camcorder , regular and digital camera + battery , film and binoculars .
Bag	POS	5	I love this case .  I own three Lowepro case ; a `` Topload Zoom 2 '' -lrb- which I use whenever I take any of my slr camera in the field -rrb- , a `` d-res 8 '' for my Canon s400 , and and a `` d-res 10 aw '' , which I use with my Fuji mx-1700 digital camera . I think that all of they be exceptionally good . they be well-made , durable , good look and functional . before settle on Lowepro a couple of year ago , I go through dozen of bag , and be never really happy with any of they .  the D-Res 10 aw be the perfect size for my Fuji mx-1700 . it be over two year old now , and look as good as the day that it arrive at my door via UPS - despite the fact that it have see lot of abuse over the last few year .
Bag	NEU	3	just a note : if you buy Nikon 900 series Digital Camera , do not buy this carry case . it be too samll . you will end up send it back . but overall , this be a nice carry case . it look and feel like leather . it include 2 accessory panel to hold spare battery and memory card .
Bag	POS	5	give this as a bday gift for my bf and he love it ... in it he put 2 large slr body and 3 lens , flash , extra charger and battery and card of course ... and it be hold up just fine ... it be sturdy but I would not overload it though ... the texture be very thick and the strap be reliable and comfortable ... I would suggest this for someone who be look for a nice , sturdy , less expensive multiple camera bag ... would not doubt it ...
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this bag on Amazon to be use at my job about two month ago . I work as a delivery Guy for a appliance store , and I also assemble thing at the store when not on the Truck . I keep everything I need in this bag , and then some ! Nut Drivers , Screw Drivers , wrench -lrb- pipe , crescent , open\/box set -rrb- , tape measure , a small level , Pliers of all sort , a rubber mallet and a hammer , and I even throw in a 12v black and Decker drill along with bit and a set of power nut driver . the scary thing be ... it CAN hold more ! bad for my tool buy addiction , but good for the on the go handy man who need everything ! very sturdy ! can not recommend enough . also have a guy work with I who have the Gatemouth Jr. , andit be another great bag , albeit a little smaller .
Bag	NEG	2	I just receive the belt sander . there be a slight oil stain in the bottom of the box , fine saw dust on the body , and metal scratch mark on the metal base on the bottom of the sander . hard to say , but some packaging might have be miss as well . use . I do not understand how this can happen but if I have to guess I would put this on Makita rather than Amazon who do not sell use version of this product . anyway , I just get off the phone and will be send it back . inspect yours carefully when you get it . note on Amazon return . I fill out a inquiry then have Amazon call I for help which they do immediately . after that I explain the problem and within minute I they issue I a return slip and will be pay for the shipping . also , they be rush I a new sander by tomorrow . while I be disappointed something like this could happen , and I be not happy about the time I waste , kudos to Amazon for make the return policy so quick and hassle free . this review have nothing to do with the performance of the belt sander as I do not even plug it in before send it back .
Bag	POS	5	i be expect shipping to be much longer ; so i be bowl over at the tracking that say my makita 9903 beltsander be on it be way . i just spend a great afternoon put my new best tool through it be pace . i be a woman ... one accustom to hard work ... and even i be a little wary of the weight of this superb worker . after a few hour of tryout , i barely notice the weight ... it be well balanced and that account for the ease of use . at that , i never once let it go full weight on the dig fur i be trim down , and i do not get tired . the belt trim and bevel beautifully . i do not have a table saw and do not want one . i rip cut my lumber with a steady hand on my circular saw . however i need some wood center brace for under my new shed set on concrete . hard to get they as snug as this virgo want without a powerful belt sander to take off no more than about 1\/32 off the top . makita do just that uniformly and in a snap . darned nice dust collector . that puppy be jam . really do it be job . i do a ton of research before buy at the best price anywhere -lrb- and fast free shipping as well ! -rrb- i want to have one that can be use in a vice . when i pull this one out of the box i realize i will have to wait to make a wood frame myself for it ; my vice , big as it be not wide enough . also , i have to puzzle over just where to afix the vice side ... it will lay flat upside down , but grip the side may take some thinking . gouge be very possible with this puppy go full throttle , but just take a afternoon and some wood scrap and get use to the feel of this totally great little worker and you should have no trouble . when i gouge a bit i just do a descend light circular setdown and it clear right up . i start on a table tomorrow and be eager to use this hard worker . oh , and i notice the roller at the front be good-sized and i plan to use it to finish some large curve for a big treli i plan to build next month . this be gonna be one very use piece of equipment , for sure !
Bag	POS	4	I be look for a dslr camera bag to keep my new Pentax k110d in until I find a more expansive bag\/backpack . I would eventually like a Tamron or something along that line but for the price , I want to be able to browse until I find just the right one . this product suit the basic bag need well . it be not huge or fancy , just a good basic bag . it have one front pocket that will hold battery , memory card , etc. and one pocket in the `` lid '' that hold a lens cloth or other small item . it accommodate the stock lens that come on my camera but I do not think would fit a much longer lense . for the price , -lrb- which be very reasonable -rrb- I would buy this bag again .
Bag	NEG	1	would get the same result if I tie on a old sock to the dust chute . quickly clog and become ineffective . use a vac or dust collector instead .
Bag	POS	5	a fantastic camera at a unbelievable price . I have take picture throughtout Europe , Australia and New zealand in all kind of weather and light condition with always the same excellent result . a great camera to take take on a hurry up and keep move tour . it take wonderful landscape , animal and people picture . even do well from a move boat or car . the auto focus be incredible . just point and shoot , the camera will lock on focus . we be now off to South America .
Bag	POS	5	Got this for my jvc-grdvm90u ... work great ... get the camcorder and all accessory include charger , cable , extra tape and manual to fit comfortably ... very stylish ... nice handle which make it very easy to carry ... highly recommend it ...
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for my boyfriend for Christmas . it be just what he want . it be roomy and material be sturdy . I would recommend it for anyone need a bag for all they metal detect equipment . thanks .
Bag	POS	5	Belt sander may be one of those power tool that be not pull out often , but when you need to remove large quantity of stock , you will want to have one . the 9403 , 4x24 sander be powerful , have good balance , good belt tracking and easy belt change . this Makita also pick up a very decent amount of sand dust , have comfortable handle , a nice soft-start , and , most importantly , chew through stock with ease . this belt sander be possibly the best 4x24 on the market . I be very , very pleased with it . it be a genuine pleasure to operate this Makita , compare to my old craftsman 3x21 which I have receive as a gift year ago . I spend as much time adjust the belt tracking on the Craftsman as I do sand , but since I use it infrequently , I just put up with the excessive noise and generally less than stellar performance . after use the 9403 for 2 + year , I shake my head everytime I use it , wonder why I wait so long to replace my old one . I find myself pull this sander out and use it more often . long cord be always a big plus for I , often eliminate the need for extension cord in the shop . I just can not find anything negative to say about this machine yet . note : be advertise as ` quiet ' at 84db be pretty relative since -rrb- 90db for sustained period will deafen ... hearing loss be cummulative over time around high db power tool -lrb- router , table and miter saw , plate joiner , etc. -rrb- even if rate under the 90db threshold ... wear ear protection -lrb- check out Peltor H10A Professional Earmuff Hearing Protectors -rrb- .

Bag	NEG	2	I take a lot of photography trip on weekend . one thing I like to do be to leave my 70-200mm or 100-400mm lens attach to the camera , on top of the photo bag in the passenger seat of the truck while I drive in rural area . if I see something of interest , I stop the truck grab the camera , get out and take some image . that be what attract I to this product . the issue with this bag be that if you have a lens with a lens hood , the lens will not fit in the compartment of the bag , and still be functional as be advertise -lrb- and as I describe above -rrb- . I have a 24-70 with lens hood , a 16-35 with lens hood , a 70-200 with lens hood , a 100-400 with lens hood , a 100mm macro with lens hood , etc. . these lens do not fit in the bag , with the hood invert , if you want to carry you camera across the top as picture . I try to make it work , and end up return the bag .

I would have rather see a zipper to keep the main pouch close .  other than that , this be a fantastic case , and I recommend it .

I keep wish Amazon would bring it back ! this tote hold EVERYTHING . I have not use it much as a laptop tote , but it work well for that . otherwise , the laptop pocket be great for transport papers and magazine since that compartment be separate . the outside pocket be roomy without thing get too lose into it , and there be extra hang pocket inside the main compartment as well as a removable keychain clip . the bag itself be lightweight but very durable . it be awesome as a airplane carryon . this be a fabulous value at $ 5.95 when I buy it - worth well over that price .
Bag	POS	5	what a great buy ! this bag work great for either a digital still camera or mini camcorder . I purchase the Lowepro 40aw after research they on the internet and check out the lowepro site .

I could fit either the still camera and all the accessory -- cable , filter , you name it , or my Canon zr10 with \* almost \* all the gear . but I love it so much I buy the Lowepro Digital beltpack AW for the zr10 . they be high quality camera bag and the Digital variety come with a special lining that will not scratch sensitive lcd screen ! lot of extra little pocket for tape , smart card , cable , and charger too . the outside be soft yet rugged and well construct .

Movies_TV	POS	5	we have to wait a while to get this set , but it be worth the wait ! Great act , story line , and special effect !
Movies_TV	POS	5	the new Doctor who -lrb- David Tennant -rrb- have make this series fresh , exciting , and open it to a whole new generation . a great set ... would highly recommend .
Movies_TV	POS	5	fear this dvd set , at least if you be press for time . a season full of thoroughly entertaining , enjoyable science fiction tv episode straight from the UK be to be find within , and the temptation to put the next disc in and keep watch be terribly hard to resist . David Tennant certainly have some pretty big shoe to fill -lrb- nine pair of they , actually -rrb- , but he have really do a wonderful job in take on the role of the eccentric space\/time-wandering doctor . he be as delightfully quirky as ever , yet in a more hyperactive manner . full of frenetic humor and yet less distant emotionally , with more warmth and less sarcasm than he immediate predecessor . this make he a bit more likeable but also a bit too human perhaps ; it be easier to forget that he be not of this earth , although trace of # 9 's convincingly alien mean streak remain . and he oddball sense of wonder in the face of the unknown -- even werewolf have a certain `` beauty '' for he . in general , Tennant 's Doctor will prove to be a memorable one , I suspect , faithfully true to the character 's general persona while engagingly eccentric in its own very unique way . the storytelling have thankfully improve very much since the prior season . do not get I wrong , I like `` the complete First Series '' quite a bit , but this second time around the plotline seem less rush and the solution less sudden and out of left field . more of the story be two-parter , which help immensely in this regard . after all , the good old classic `` Doctor who '' tale gradually develop through four episode of about half a hour each ; two hour-long episode back-to-back amount to much the same thing , which may be about the ideal time necessary for a Doctor who plot to unfold . this season have a good mix of story too . many be good solid straight science fiction , and this be especially so of `` rise of the Cybermen '' -lrb- okay , even if the Cybermen 's inventor do seem like a carbon copy of Davros -rrb- , and along the same line the Doomsday battle between two classic Doctor who foe in the season finale be totally and utterly inspire ! I have dream of such a confrontation ever since I be a nerdy teenager watch this show religiously on PBS . more characteristic perhaps of the season as a whole though be story that straddle the boundary between sci-fus and horror in intriguing way , include a face-off with the devil himself . sound corny , but it be actually pull off well , downright scary but with just the right dose of agnostic ambiguity . not every episode be a masterpiece , of course . the masterpiece would not stand out then . and everyone will have they favorite . but overall this be a fine year 's worth of a excellent show in its latest incarnation , the New New New New New New New New New New Doctor who .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I be very pleasantly surprise when I see this movie . most Disney sequel be unwatchably awful , and Cinderella II be not very good . however , Cinderella III : A twist in Time be , for a direct-to-video release , quite excellent . the animation be very good , the music be passable , and the plot be interesting , but what really stand out be the re-characterization of Cinderella and the prince . the prince be very flat in the original film , but here he be get a recognizable personality , he be nice , and he be not stupid ; the evil stepmother have to use magic in order to get he to go along with she scheme . Cinderella get awesome . in the original film she be nothing more than singing sugar and fluff , but here she have very realistic reaction to heartbreaking situation , and she get very strong in addition to still be nice and kind . one of Cinderella 's scene near the end of the movie even feel a little bit like a animated fantasy action flick . the end , though a little unexpected , be also very satisfactory . the only real complaint I have be that the beginning of the movie be over-the-top silly , and Anastasia 's romance from Cinderella II be not mention except for a single image in the credit , but overall , if you like Disney movie , Cinderella III be definitely one to get .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	when I FIRST see it I hate it !!!!! it be a total disappointment !!!!!! a total disappointment !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish it CAN be destroy !!!!!!!!!!!! man it totally butcher the entire story !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SEQUALS be suppose to continue the story not bring you back where you just start !!!!!!!! I agree with couple of the reviewer here on -lrb- ... -rrb- regard this movie . one be R. Love `` primemaiden '' who say , `` do happily ever after mean anything to you people at Disney . '' yeah do not it mean anything at DISNEY anymore to live happily ever after !!!???? and another person who I profoundly agree with be also another reviewer of this movie at amazon.com , Princess fanatic , who say , `` I be go to stick this movie very far down in a closet and pretend it be never make . '' I say , `` WELL DONE MY DEAR lady , BUT DO you know what I say ?!?!?!!?! '' I say , `` THIS MOVIE should be BURNED to ASHES AFTER all the copy be confiscate from everybody who poss THIS ABOMINABLE DIMWITTED stupid RETARTED ZERO IQ LEVEL movie !!!!!!!!!

REALLY REALLY stupid movie !!!! WHOEVER MADE this I wish I can put him in the TOILET and FLUSH HIM DOWN . hope that will knock SOME SENSE INTO HIM !!!! o yes if possible I would give this movie -80 star , not 1 !!!!
Movies_TV	POS	4	its great to see Hackman reprise he operative character from `` the conversation '' .  the point of this film as to how far along we be towards `` 1984 '' and `` Big Brother '' be perhaps indicate by we lack of alarm about it . its interesting what the situational awareness the Feds can gain by have a emittor on the Will Smith character , its instructive conceptually as to how you could steer yourself and other unit to intercept or stay close without get too close . but this technology be show to collapse when the sensor be not `` cheating '' by the emittor and have to use line-of-sight collection mean to stay in contact with they prey in a cluttered urban environment . if you watch the film conceptually as a demonstration of military and possibly totalitarean technology its worth 4 star . if you watch it for entertainment and plausibility it lack realism since if the corrupt Feds want the Will Smith character 's tape they would have barge in , kill he and make it look like something else . of course there would be no film and chase then .  we should reject violently these `` reality '' tv show where such totalitarean surveillance means be take in jest like its a mere popularity contest : if you become a `` enemy of the state '' you get vote to be `` banish '' might not be a laughing matter .

Movies_TV	POS	4	the relevance of this film be strikingly frightening today . the unsuspecting John Q Public -lrb- Will Smith -rrb- be on the run , even strip down to he boxer to symbolize the insecurity of the average amercian by the ever-intrusive government swear to uphold we ineffective Constitutional Rights ; highlight modern technology go rampant under the guise of protect we supposedly inherent natural rights . the right to privacy be trample on by NSA agent -lrb- portray as young prying clown -rrb- under the command of a nefarious reptile play to a t by Jon Voight . the player in the system of illusory rights hound John Q Public since he unknowingly carry on he evidence of a congressman 's death and it be at this point where thing slowly unfold for the naive citizen as he be relentlessly chase by big Brother via satellite , ATM and tunnel camera , cell phone signal tracking , bug , etc. hit home the film 's point : privacy be a thing of the past . it even point out that a natural serene pond view of goose be not a safe place for some privacy . the film gain steam midway as a paranoidal ex-nsa agent , Brill -lrb- Hackman -rrb- literally knock some sense into John Q and show he the painful truth ; the truth that Joe Blow easily dismiss during a scene earlier into the movie . release almost 3 year prior to 9\/11 , `` enemy of the state '' bombard the sens with quick editing , hyper-action , and loud jolt of sound as if to say , `` wake up ! '' Orwell have be roll in he grave for some time now . one reviewer point out Brill 's birthday of 9\/11 in a quick flash scene . if only this be a coincidence and not a confirm nod to those who be privy numerologist , but consider the studio which release this film it should be of no surprise . so sit back , crack open a can of soda and pop open a bag of popcorn and pay witness to one man 's life quickly turn upside down by a power hungry , guilt-ridden government seek safety under its ever-intrusive eye .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this release seem to have draw out more eloquence and expertise from Amazon reviewer than most . it be clearly warmly regard as a classic by the great majority . pc issue , or rather the non-pc issue have be debate with well-conceived and finely deliver statement by both side . as be usually the case in such matter , I do not imagine that the disputant have move a inch from they original position -- or ever will . as for myself , I hold sufficiently warm feeling for Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' to endorse the many five-star rating it have already earn . I clearly remember see `` Peter Pan '' during its first run , once at a grand and lordly downtown movie palace on San Francisco 's Market Street and again , a little later , in second-run at a neighborhood theater on Mission Street . I be ten year old at the time and recollect that the movie be a thing of considerable interest among my friend and schoolmate . the consensus of opinion among discerning ten year-old be positive but not ecstatic . much the same be true for the review that run in the old News , Call-Bulletin , Examiner and Chronicle newspaper . -lrb- why be I pour over movie review in four daily papers at the age of ten ? I have no idea , but there you be . -rrb- the big advertising hook for the film be that for the FIRST TIME EVER !! Peter Pan would be portray by a boy rather than a middle-aged woman . we ten-year old be , as I recall , singularly unmoved by that . most of we be particularly well disposed toward Hans Conried 's Captain Hook and to the Crocodile , of course . both be authoritatively pronounced to be real zorch . -lrb- a San Francisco nonce-word invent by a then-popular disk jockey . it quickly give way before the better know `` cool . '' -rrb- on the other hand , we moppet film critic also generally agree with we elder professional who hold that `` Peter Pan '' represent a artistic fall off from Disney 's earlier masterpiece , `` Pinocchio , '' `` Dumbo , '' and especially `` Bambi , '' all of which have be re-release within we time horizon . -lrb- I be pretty sure that the next re-release of `` Snow White '' be much later . -rrb- compare to those true classic of animation , we think `` Peter Pan '' look cheap , cheesy and flat -- although I be sure we do not use those particular term , rely instead on the ever-eloquent , `` it be ok , I guess . '' in 1955 come the first black and white tv version of the New York musical with Mary Martin . it return in a new live -lrb- on kinescope for the West Coast -rrb- version and again in 1960 , that time in color , I think . as I remember it , that version have much greater impact . Mary Martin be simply better at everything than Bobby Driscoll be at anything . the musical score be better , too -- brasher and edgier than the Disney tune , which even in 1953 be move well along the path to the familiar musical pap so beloved by Uncle Walt . that be then , this be now . Mary Martin 's three `` Peter Pans '' be mere historical artifact , while this `` Peter Pan , '' like its hero , shall remain forever fresh and young .
Movies_TV	POS	5	cute animated movie . however this be NOT the DISNEY version
Movies_TV	POS	4	I rent this expect it to be totally mediocre , but at least worth a 3 $ rental . I be pleasantly surprise to find this very watchable , thrilling , and something I 'll probably rent again . Will Smith be great and easy on the eye . all the acting be very good , though Jon Voight have pop up in so many movie lately I be start to get tired of he . I do not figure out how it be go to end , and the final showdown , plus how the main character outwit the bad guy be great . Tom Sizemore I do not recognize at first since he be put on so much weight , but he be fantastic . I give the writer extra point for not go for the cheap shot and have the bad guy kill Gene Hackman 's kitty -lrb- if they have , I would have only give this movie one star , and probably not watch the rest -rrb- . I think that they do kind of beat you over the head with the `` SURVEILLANCE be BAD '' message . after the first half hour it be like , ok , I get the idea guy . the various fictional super-sophisticated tracking device be cool , and Tony and Ridley Scott always shoot they film beautifully . oh , and the woman who play Will Smith 's wife kick a $ $ !
Movies_TV	NEG	2	I will not lie . it be be over six year since I have actually see this movie . back then I do not like it . I still do not . but now , I have realize something : there be symbolism in this movie . you see , Peter Pan represent a certain someone . who , you ask ? come closer . now , we all know that the character Tinkerbell be model after , -lrb- or at least draw to the likeness of -rrb- , Marilyn Monroe . coincidence ? I do not think so . can you guess who Pan be yet ? oh-kay , Peter Pan stand for John F. Kennedy - you know , irresponsible , young , womanize , etc. . do not believe I ? look at Pan ! he be dress in green , the color of the Irish . he associate with not one , not two , but three woman in this film . sound like JFK to I . wendy stand as the voice of reason , Jackie . Captain Hook , of course , be Lee Harvey Oswald , and that alligator ... or crocodile ... thing , be Jack Ruby . Odd , be not it ?  Well , I hope you have enjoy this little essay ... or review ... or ... ah , whatever .

Movies_TV	POS	4	as a fan of the original series - especially the golden age of Tom Baker -lrb- when he be still take the show seriously -rrb- - I have not be disappoint with the new `` who . '' from the wonderfully rework title sequence and theme tune -lrb- so much better than the tinny version that introduce the show from late Baker onward -rrb- the new series maintain much of the charm of the original without the wobbly set . I love Christopher Ecclestone 's portrayal of the Doctor , so await this second season with a little trepidation . although I find David Tennant 's Doctor a little more superficial , he do a creditable job nevertheless . but why oh why be BBC dvd SOOOOOO expensive ? sure , they be generally a quality product , but that do not justify charge two to three time as much as for a equivalent US series . sorry BBC - until you price be competitive , I 'll be rent this and future who , not buy they .
Movies_TV	POS	5	note : as of this moment , the Two-Disc platinum edition of Peter Pan be in limited distribution -lrb- I have see it -rrb- and most of the review that appear now refer to a earlier version . the Two-Disc platinum edition version can be pre-order from Amazon and Borders and offer new special feature which include a restore original theatrical soundtrack all-new digital restoration with enhance picture and sound , `` Camp Never Land : explore never land '' with all-new multi-level game , delete song , a feature during which Walt Disney explain `` why I make Peter Pan , '' `` the Peter Pan Story : 1952 '' featurette , a sneak peek of the all-new Tinker Bell movie , another feature `` you can fly : the make of Peter Pan , '' a t-squad music video : `` the second star to the Right , '' a Peter Pan virtual flight , Peter 's Playful Prank dvd storybook , and a never-before-seen alternate opening . over the year , I have see various version of this delightful film and enjoy it at least as much now as I do when it be first release in 1953 . on several occasion , I have also visit Disneyland and vividly recall the excitement of the ride when my companion and I depart the child 's bedroom and fly above London at night en route to Neverland . the so-called `` magic kingdom '' be more a state-of-mind than a location because the genius of Walt Disney and he associate be that , in way and to a extent no one else ever have , they activate and engage imagination . this be especially true of this film that , unlike most of the other animation feature , involve a journey by air as well as by land . literally , one 's imagination soar above and beyond human concern , at least for 77 minute . unlike other Disney villain -lrb- e.g. honest John and Stromboli in Pinocchio , the Queen\/Witch in Snow White and the seven dwarf -rrb- , Captain Hook be at least as amusing as he be threaten . the fate of the darling child be never really in doubt . we know that eventually , theirs will be a safe return to they home and family . -lrb- I have no such confidence - as a child -- when first view Dumbo , Pinocchio , and Snow White and the seven dwarf . -rrb- although for most of we , `` there be no place like home , '' we enjoy and appreciate opportunity to travel far and wide - at least in we imagination - and become involve in adventure of various kind , as the darling child do . those who already have a earlier version of Peter Pan can continue to enjoy it , of course , but at least some of they will welcome this Two-Disc platinum edition because of all of its special feature , previously unavailable . I only wish other dvd offer special feature of comparable variety , quality , and entertainment value .

Run , jump , watch out theres a helicopter . Yawn . ive see Xfiles episode with similar story line that put this to shame but do it with a small fraction of the budget . what a waste .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this movie lack any level of credibility . the technology be ridiculous from the start and get worse as the movie continue . I do not care about any of the people in this movie at all and I never see a point in any of the action . it be almost as though the character be compel to do the most outlandish thing possible instead of think about a normal and believable way out of they predicament .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I be a huge Cinderella fan ; however , Disney dissapoint I with `` Cinderella II , '' so I be leary of `` a twist in Time . '' however despite minor nitpick this film be great for kid , and portray Cinderella as more independent and actually fight against she antagonist . several flaw - the music - `` perfectly perfect perfect year ! '' - gag I . the mouse should not ever sing .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I do not remember ever be that take with Peter Pan when I be younger , it certainly be never my favorite , but as I have mention in previous review , I be collect the special edition , and wait -lrb- im -rrb- patiently for the one that have already be out , and go again . convenient how they be release these special edition around every 6 year or so , just in time for the next generation to start clamour at they parent that they want they ! while I find Peter Pan funnier than I remember -lrb- Mr Darling , Smee , Captain Hook & the croc -rrb- , I could not help but see Bob Hoskins as Smee and Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook - yes I have see Hook way too many time ! apart from that , I notice that , although not as much as the earlier Disney movie , there be still some reference that I really do not think should be in a kid movie - the fairy dust for instance ? that make they fly ? how many of you try to jump off you garden fence or you garage when you be young ? and also the fact they show John smoking what look like very suspicious substance . but this certainly would not be show in today 's very politically correct Disney . there be also some terrible stereotype about american Indians . I find Wendy 's voice as irritating as usual , but I definitely find it familiar , so I be probably still remember it from when I be young . Peter be never a favorite character of mine and like Walt Disney himself , I find it to be really cold and quite unlikable . this be a must for collector , with the usual special feature , although if you find yourself bore during the game , that be because they be aim at kid . not we old one . unless you fancy try the 9x9 suduko - I could not do it . the next special edition be the jungle book , out in the autumn , not particularly another favorite of mine , but I be still look forward to it .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	season one of the show in reincarnated form be not bad . the older doctor have a air of experience and wisdom . season two 's younger version of the doctor seem to lack that . the actor have he own humor and twist to the character . we 'll have to see how the season and series progress with he in the role .
Movies_TV	POS	5	`` enemy of the state '' have become a classic movie by now . a non-stop action movie and now with the spectacular clarity of blu ray , you just can not go wrong . I have watch this movie a thousand time and I never get bore of it . now in blu ray , the quality of this movie be astonishing . I would recommend it to anyone who love thrilled-action movie .
Movies_TV	POS	4	just a brief correction of the previous review . you heart 's in the right place , Charles -lrb- fellow atlantan ! -rrb- and you be absolutely correct to insist that PETER PAN be not a widescreen film ... but KING & I most definitely WAS NOT the first widescreen movie . that honor likely fall to Abel Gance 's 1927 masterpiece NAPOLEON . even in the modern era , Fox have have they cinemascope process go strong for 3 year by the time KING & I appear . the first cinemascope film be the robe , release on September 16 , 1953 , follow by beneath the 12 mile reef the same year and then dozen of other . it be true that the first widescreen cartoon feature do not appear until 1956 : Disney 's own lady and the tramp , also in Cinemascope . at any rate , buyer can approach this disc with confidence ; nothing at all be `` cut-off . ''
Movies_TV	POS	4	unlike Chris E. David Tennent be not one to go pound moral down you skull -lrb- though I do like Escleston 's energy and dynamics -rrb- David Tennent 's `` Tenth '' , himself be not in foulable in he mishap . Tennent 's 10th who , -lrb- who -rrb- I also think do quite well in `` Cassanova '' be a silly eccentric with more on be a crazy imperfect himself and eccept that than be obligate to appologize afterwards as do Chris E. . Billy Piper odviously do not speek `` Pig Common '' though as she fake accent sometimes faulter in situation that Pig Common can not artiqulate as in the bazaar sci-fus word and reaction to alien . usually she come off fine in normal situation that call for the Pig Common charm . Might I suggest try to emulate Peter Woodthorpe who be the `` scum of theive '' in he speech . also he be Gollumn in the Baski Lord of the ring . the boyfreind be a backwheel and depict k-9 as such insulting both character as be as such when they could be more pivotal and take more seriously by the audience if thing be just leave to roll on . Doc # 9 hate everyone in Rose 's life except Rose herself and this alienate the audience -lrb- at least I -rrb- from he . Tennent do this but to a lesser degree . -lrb- and it be a good thing to a degree -rrb- the irreprotiable 9 and 10 be both much like Tom Baker and Chris E. be more on William Hartnel with the exception that Tom Baker do not leave people to die becasue of questionable `` character '' as do Escleston -lrb- even will Hartnel 's 1st be merciful to we moron . -rrb- . Tennent have move away from the mondane and moralistic modernizaton of Earth and it be reala t show feel and be more like the doctor -lrb- s -rrb- of old . though the feel be still the way escleston 's story and atmopshere be which I do not really like . it be still entertaining and fun with tenent and though I like Escleston 's early one -lrb- usually writen by Russel Davies himself -rrb- he later one be more like Stargate and the cheapness of sci-fus channel stuff and it be P.C. feel . Briton have a weird way of conveigh idea to the audiance and I prefer the tone down morality check of tenent and even Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee who be more into the entertainment area than the informative area . k-9 be not a second bannana to the companion ! Sarah Jane be not a `` Ender '' or a dead wash-out as `` she make I smile in the end '' as the song -lrb- from she heyday -rrb- go .
Movies_TV	POS	5	doctor who have return to telelvision after a long hiatus , and it be still `` get it '' , to quote the Doctor himself . the second season\/series be exciting , frightening , dramatic , and fun all at the same time . it be good family entertainment . smaller child might find some of the alien a little frightening , but , as a parent , that would be my only concern with this program . virtually no swearing , no bed hop , or nudity , and at the end of the day , the doctor take a stand and do what he think be right , because he believe that that be what you should do .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I always want to know what would happen after the Happly ever after and this movie let you know . i have love Cinderella since i be young and love the story and this movie be great i be glad that it all work out in the end if you love the story the first time you will want to watch this movie and you will enjoy it .

Movies_TV	POS	5	i like this movie because it have lot of action and also i like because the producer be will smith and he be one of my best actor in the world and also i like other movie about he like bad boy or wild wild west those be good movie too . but enemy of the state be better than these that i just mention above .
Movies_TV	NEG	2	again , Jerry Bruckenheimer make the believable unbelievably over-dramatized , i.e. con air , Armageddon , etc. . why be this guy still make movie ? too many people with little intelligence think that he movie be good . why ?
Movies_TV	POS	5	all I can say be WOW !!! I order this movie 2 day ago and its here ! the movie be exactly what I expect ! thank you !
Movies_TV	POS	5	I be leery of the new series because the original be so terrific ; however , I be now completely win over ! it be amazing to I that the writer have infuse the flavor of the original series into the update story as well as they have . it just get better and better . I think Christopher Eccleston be the best doctor yet and then along come David Tennant ! I can not wait for series 3 .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I buy this dvd on a whim and when I go to preview it , I could not help myself - I have to join in . some of the move make you feel a bit silly , but they be fun and different ! the instructor look like she be have a great time and the move be pretty easy to follow . the move be a mix of silly , cute and sexy . overall I think this be a really fun workout ! it be great for people who give in while work out because the move seem so silly , cute , or fun that you want to keep go . I think the instructor be great , the scenery be pretty , and the workout be fun !
Movies_TV	POS	5	have love season 1 , the idea of a new doctor be a little daunting . my fear be lay to rest in the first five minute of the Christmas episode and by the end of that episode I be totally in love with David Tennant . he make the doctor he own while keep the essence of the character . and Billie Piper ? well , I see she first pop video when she first hit the music scene in England as a teenager . she have transform herself into a very good actress . she be perky without be irritating and cry REAL tear . you gotta love the girl who make the doctor smile . Piper play equally as well with tennant as she do with Christopher Eccleston . I will miss she be season 3 so all the more reason to relish the dvd set . season 2 be gripping , exciting , touching , funny , suspenseful , emotional , and simply bloody FANTASTIC ! I still cry during the final 2 episode . favorite episode be `` Tooth and Claw '' . this episode be not only creepy with its warrior monk and werewolf but set up Torchwood as season two 's `` hint '' game . Watch all the episode again and follow the trail of Torchwood . all the episode maintain the high standard set by season one and in someway surpass it . quality tv even if you be not a sci-fi fan .
Movies_TV	POS	4	enemy of the State prove to be as intelligent as it be exciting . Will Smith prove that he can act and Gene Hackman do a wonderfull job in he role -lrb- as do John Voit -rrb- . enemy of the state be definatly worth check out and one of the best thriller in a long time .
Movies_TV	POS	5	not only be the episode amazing , but the commentary and extra footage be completely worth the money spend on this dvd set . David Tennant 's Video Diary be funny and insightful into the making of the series , as well as he personal journey as the 10th doctor . I be impress at the length of the diary , and the quality of the Doctor who Confidential piece . Great set !! can not wait until season 3 in April : -rrb-

I totally will purchase from this seller in the future and recomend other to do so as well . thank you Northwest Discounts ! Sincerly Carole
Movies_TV	POS	5	I buy this delightful dvd for my 4 year old grandaughter . she be so excite when she receive it for Valentine 's day . it be a great story and yes , it do have a twist that make it much different from other Cinderella movie . I would recommend this movie for any child but , especially little girl who think they be princess !
Movies_TV	NEU	3	Disney movie in general be just better than everyone else 's , but not so for sequel . Disney sequel be famously bad , with mediocre music and iffy plot . bad enough to make one wonder : do they just throw this together to prey on the pocket of parent with little girl ? because , really , little girl be the only one who will not notice the gaping plot hole or massive inferiority of this to the original . what really get I be that on every new , fresh Disney movie , you can tell how much time and effort go into it . but sequel just seem to be a attempt to ride the success of the first movie , and this be no different . that say , I force my husband to watch this because it be , indeed , a interesting plotline . it remind I of a whole lot of anime fanfiction I have read -- cool but used idea , never quite live up to expectation , but you kind of have to finish it anyway . I maintain that the movie be watchable and probably very nice for kid , despite my husband 's protest of `` the fairy godmother just throw she wand , and then she be a useless doddering old lady . not magical at all . what kind of fairy godmother just throw she wand ?! '' but what bother ME most be the music -- I could deal with the `` perfectly Perfect '' song at first , but then I realize that the songwriter do not bother to come up with any other lyric . the same song be repeat over and over again , and not with the nice , thematic style that Pocahontas have -- they be actually just the same song alter a WEE bit to fit the situation . mean either the note or the word , but never both . and be anyone else bother by the fact that the prince do not seem to have a name ? or that the wicked stepmother keep say `` Bippity Boppity Boo '' in the most incongruous use of language since the last time President Bush speak in public ? I watch it . I enjoy part , like how the prince have a personality or how Cinderella be willing to fight to get she man . but it be not the Cinderella of Walt Disney 's day . Walt would not have allow this to be put on the market like it be . he have standard .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I do not really think the quality could be improve on a older film like this , but this dvd be amazing . its like a brand new movie . Crisp picture and beautiful sound .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my wife and I become instant Doctor who fan from the moment we watch the first episode of Series 1 . I be worry when Christopher Eccleston leave the show , but David Tennant have turn about to be a excellent doctor . the Third Series will be a instant buy when it be release later this year .
Movies_TV	NEG	2	ever see a movie that take you so far that you actually see the character as someone really talk in front of you ? Will Smith , Lisa Bonet and Tom Sizemore -lrb- amongst the other -rrb- , be act too hard . they be not convince enough to make I feel like they be real character . again , the action be great . but the acting be contrived and predictable .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Peter Pan be a story for all child and adult to watch . it would be hard to imagine life without wendy , John and Michael travel with Peter to Neverland . or that trademark pixie tinkerbell with she magic gold dust that make the child fly . add in a group of lose boy , and the legendary evil pirate Captain Hook , and you have a classic tale for life . this story have magic , pirate , and imagination beyond all belief . the two disc set be nice to have in you collection . Watch the second disc , its load with stuff . Stephen John Beccia author of the treelander
Movies_TV	NEG	1	it be hard to put into word how bad this movie really be . normally , I have never have any issue with Disney sequel , like some people do ; in fact , I like they . I love Cinderella II because it play with the idea of the ` what happen after happily ever after ' ? Cinderella II be entertaining , for I , and it do not alter anything of the original story . this movie however be a disaster ; both of my girl be extremely disappoint by this movie . like someone else say it be a insult to the first movie and I would say the second one too . it seem that the producer , or writer , who make this movie could not think of any good story line , and end up only repeat the same thing over and over again . worst of all , it look like they do not bother to do any story continuance with Cinderella II . in that movie , Anastasia have already meet someone she love -lrb- the baker -rrb- and apparently she even have go to the palace to dance with he . in this story that start in Cinderella 's first wedding anniversary -lrb- which have the kid assume that Anastasia 's story already happen -rrb- we go back to Anastasia hate Cinderella and there be no mention of the baker . Anastasia be look for true love , but the problem be that if you follow the movie she be suppose to have find it already . the producer annul the first two movie so they could tell again a story that do not need fix . now it do need fix , because annul two wonderful movie so they can give we a mediocre sequel be quite a achievement . the movie be so absolutely horrendous that even the song be hard to listen too . the movie have nothing good to entertaining you with , but have plenty to leave you fume for hour if you be a Disney or Cinderella fan . to make thing worst , they deliver a mortal blow at the end of the movie when Cinderella and Prince charming first year of marriage it be erase and they start all over again . so Cinderella 's first wedding never exist and we instead get that less than satisfy end . what be that for ? be they plan another sequel ? I hope that this be not the case ; because I be go to stick this movie very far down in a closet and pretend it be never make . it make I weep for what they have do to Walt Disney 's creation .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I buy this for my wife for Christmas , along with the Cinderella Collector 's Edition box and Cinderella II and she absolutely love they all . I also have a 6 month old daughter , who I know will also love these film . if you have a wife , girlfriend , daughter , or just anyone who love Disney movie , this be a must have for they collection .
Movies_TV	POS	4	yes , there be a scene miss from the 1953 Disney movie ! we watch it again recently after see `` Finding Neverland '' . I be wait for the `` if you believe in fairy , clap you hand ! '' part -lrb- my favorite moment in the original film -rrb- , but it never come ! what be Disney think ???!!! do anyone know if the unedited original be available for sale anywhere ?
Movies_TV	POS	5	excellent premise of Washington high tech crime in the national security community . Will Smith be better in this than in WWW . he be a good choice for this part . put he with Gene Hackman and you get explosive scene . excellent action footage and the cut room work be excellent .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my girl love this movie and I actually find myself watch along . I recommend it for all little Princess 's .
Movies_TV	POS	5	receive in excellent condition and before estimate delivery time - which I be extremely thankful for ! be extremely excite to have my very own copy , finally ! thanks !
Movies_TV	POS	5	incredible movie , great action , fine acting , Hackman at he be
Movies_TV	POS	4	I rent this movie from netflix because I just love rendition of the Cinderella story . I think that this would be something purely tacky that Disney be merely try to make a profit on . well , I dont doubt that they be at least try to make a profit , but it be surpisingly better than i anticipate . I love the twist on the story in which Cinderella need to save herself and work without magic to win the prince . it have a stronger feminist message . I also love how the end uplift the idea of want a man to love someone for who she truly be as well . it have a stronge feminist message as a result which i fully appreciate . but it do not take away any of the fun or emotional sense of magic within the underlie message . the reason I give it four star be because even though I enjoy the twist on this , its really hard to beat a classic !
Movies_TV	POS	5	amazing movie ! and great dvd quality . no scratch , come wrap in plastic . good buy ... 10\/10 !
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I be really disappoint with this release , I be expect a nice widescreen edition of this movie with great sound , but it be just a mediocre standard dvd .
Movies_TV	POS	4	this movie be one of the coolest movie ! I like wendy and John and -lrb- of course -rrb- Peter Pan . Captain Hook and Mr. Smee be funny too . I also like the mermaid ... they be so pretty ! however , this movie be probably least like the book out of all the Disney movie . in the book , Wendy 's father do not even threaten to give she she own room ! the book actually be better than the movie , which I give four star because they be so different . my favorite part of the movie be where they be at Mermaid lagoon , where Captain Hook be dangle off a cliff and Peter say `` I say Captain , do you hear something ? '' and you hear the ticking of the crocodile . I do not know why that be so funny to I . anyway , this be a cool movie , and if you have not see it you definitely should rent it . : -rrb-  P.S. what be the deal with Peter Pan 's voice in the sequel ? it be totally weird !!!
Movies_TV	POS	5	I be a fan of the older series , but David Tennant make the new series that much more amazing . he be perfect as `` the doctor '' and definitely bring a life to the season he have star in that make this truly the kind of awesome I have come to expect from Doctor who .
Movies_TV	POS	5	the best doctor ever on the best show on tv ! this sum it up , if you love classic Doctor who and have not have a chance to see this show just buy it ! I know you will love it ! David Tennant be the perfect doctor !
Movies_TV	POS	5	as a huge Doctor who fan , I could not wait to get my hand on this dvd set . I be not disappoint . aside from the great storyline and dramatic conclusion to this second season of the most recent installment of Doctor who , this dvd set have great extra with ton of behind-the-scenes look at the making of the show , as well as delete scene and blooper -lrb- always fun to watch -rrb- . I would recommend this to any fan of the show - it be absolutely brilliant .
Movies_TV	POS	5	purchase a number of the classic Disney video for my grandson and as you would expect they be great .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	this be another attempt of Disney 's to take one of they fondest character and stretch she likability and promise WAY too thin to earn a profit . even so , this film best they last direct-to-video installment , Cinderella 2 , which I turn off after just ten minute . this movie make you yearn for the original film and the magic that go into it . it do have its high point , though , in that I love see the stepsister character develop . maybe a better direct-to-dvd offering would simply be a stepsister biography ? anyway , some of the character action do not ring true . and a time-travel theme ? that might be better suit for a Star Trek movie . however , that be the gimmick that get I to buy this film in the first place ! maybe the next sequel will be Cinderella 4 : back 4 more , Race against the machine . if you must consider any Disney sequel , try Bambi II , which I believe be far superior .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	so yeah , I have not see this movie . I probably will and it probably will not be terribly stupid as some sequel be , but this pain I . greatly . Cinderella two be not the greatest disney sequel . the little mermaid 2 and mulan 2 be both better . so why be it that this one get 's a 3 ? why should any of they get a 3 ? if anyone from disney read this -- PICK ANOTHER FAIRY TALE !!! there be lot out there that have not be disneytize . Rapunzel , Rumpelstiltzkin , and then there be the one from other coutnry that western europe and Grimm and stuff . China -- like Mulan -- good movie . Make something new and original again . please !!! parent , babysitter , and teacher who have to watch these thing beg you !!

Movies_TV	NEU	3	actually buy it for my baby girl . be kind of cute but then again , this be suppose to be for child not adult . I recommend it to all the parent who do have little girl go through the `` princess '' period .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I have already see the other two Cinderella movie , so I think , why not watch this one too ? I must say that I be pleasantly suprised . this movie be very sweet and it show more of the prince 's side of the story , unlike the other two movie . I really love it . it be a great movie for younger girl . older girl could get into it too , see as I be 16 and enjoy it . all in all , a lovely movie .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	when this movie be release , the `` Evil Right wing '' Republicans be so blantantly portray as facist that they be almost parody . no more after the horror of Sept 11th -lrb- I be a survivor -rrb- , it be Will Smith 's wife -lrb- the wonderful ACLU Attorney -rrb- who it turn out be the characature . when she just brush off a republican Senator state on Larry King that there be 1000s of foreign nationial in america who hate the USA . she call he a facist ... what would she say now ?? I guess that would depend on if she have a loved kill in the Sept 11 attack . Afterall , ACLU lawyer seem to have the conscience of serial killer when it be innoncent man woman and child kiil who be no relation to they . but nevertheless , this movie be too disturbing to watch now that the real world have overshadow the liberal elite version of the world .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Sit back and get catch up in , I would say yhe best thriller of the year . Will Smith and Gene Hackman play together for the first time - and I must say that they be do it very , very good . I can not say more about this movie than - exellent .
Movies_TV	POS	5	what more can I say ? it be a classic - and it be Disney , can not get much better than that !
Movies_TV	POS	4	Peter Pan be a very fun movie . very childish happening . Tinkerbell be a classic assistant actress and be very selfish , mean-spirited and in love with Peter Pan . so when another try to get close -lrb- namely girl like wendy -rrb- she will not take to this lightly ! just watch and see ! it be a story that be be tell a thousand time but if you be a Disney fan , this have to be relive !! Peter Pan come to John and Michael 's nursery once in a while just to see how thing be . he inspire the child to play and imitate Peter Pan and the Captain Hook , and wendy , to keep the story alive . Neverland be any 6 or 7 year old kid 's fantasy world , but ANYONE can relive the glory that be Peter Pan . I do not wanna spend the whole night write this review but I will just say that it hold brilliance ; magic and such and should not be ignore ! get you copy tonight and make the child in you life smile over and over ! favorite character : Peter Pan , Michael , Tinkerbell and the Fox boy . : -rrb- Cover Art : b - inside art : C Story : b + character : a dialogue : b - comic Relief : b - music -lrb- score -rrb- : b + length : a - 4.2 star . overall : b -

Movies_TV	POS	5	this be a very good movie about be in the wrong place at the wrong time .  in the overview of this movie this poor man , in the wrong place at the wrong time , lose he life . he be give something , which he do not even know he have . which implicate a high ranking government official in something that he do not want public . consequently he life be take away . he credit card cancel , he friend murder -lrb- he be frame -rrb- and the one person who can help he do not want to get involve because he know how the government work . the non-helpful person be part of a government agency in the past . Insights into the NSA and what they be capable of make this movie a eye opener .  highly recommend movie .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I have be watch Doctor who for decade . I have love they . I be happy to season the Doctor come back . last season be great , and what we family have watch thus far be great . welcome back doctor !
Movies_TV	NEG	2	I order both the Walt Disney Peter Pan video and the Mary Martin Peter Pan video for my son at the same time and the difference between the two be shocking . Walt Disney have exaggerate to the point of stereotype many aspect of the story . for example , Tinkerbell , who represent a spirit in the story of Peter Pan , in the Walt Disney version be such a flirt and jealous , as well as overly concern with how big she hip be that the whole meaning of she be lose . the indian in the Walt Disney version be stereotyped as well and I be shock that as my son now say Indians do not have face . the Walt Disney version contain much unnecessary violence . all and all the Mary MArtin Peter Pan be so much more heart-warming and magical and fun .
Movies_TV	POS	5	enemy of the state star will Smith and Gene Hackman . neither of these fine actor make a bad movie that I know of . this be a fine thriller movie about government surveillance and a bad national security agent play by Jon Voight . the good news be that the surveillance technology feature in this movie be for real and target against US enemy . the bad news be that sometimes the government thing we be the enemy .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	buy this dvd think it might show a few more dancemove for Bollywood . I be so disappointed with it ! 3 woman in a Bollywood inspire set who frollock about for 50min demonstrate move that a 5 year old would do better . very badly demonstrate and not at all ` sassy ' ... this be constantly use to describe what you should be do while dancing . not at all inspiring and ideal for 14-16yr old who fancy themselves . really bad dvd and it be not a workout . save yourself the bother of get it only to return it and just get any of the other dvd !! such a pity as some of the review be positive and influence my decision to purchase - will be more cautious in future .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Amazon be the best site out there for good service . the movie be great my grandkid love it .

Movies_TV	POS	5	when I get this , I think it would be a fun , easy workout for my lazy day . boy be I surprise when my leg start burn halfway through the dvd . the best workout be the one where you can have fun , and not feel as though you be work out wait for a repetition to be finish . she encourage you to move at you own pace throughout and for once you do not feel like you be slack if you modify it a bit . I thoroughly enjoy this and will add it to my routine . it be the perfect workout to lift you mood , especially on lazy day . highly recommend it .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I like this movie alot . it do not just start you off from somewhere you would not be able to tell what be go on . it give you the blow by blow and tell you how thing like this can happen .  will Smith be a lawyer who get involve in something by accident . he friend from school drop something into he bag without tell Smith that it be a important government tape that could get he kill . the friend meet he demise and Smith be stick with the tape . the plot ensue that the government be out to get the tape back and Smith do not know .  it be interesting to see how something like this could happen today . anyone with a spy cam could get any info about you . imagine what the government can do .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be one of my favorite movie ever . a long movie by usual standard , but very compelling and very entertaining . the extend version run about 140 minute , 8 minute longer than the blu-ray version .
Movies_TV	POS	5	spoiler follow Walt Disney 's 1953 animated film `` Peter Pan '' be one of several film that help build a sterling reputation for the company 's feature-length animation . with the voice talent of Bobby Driscoll , Hans Conried , and Kathryn Beaumont , it remain timeless entertainment . a adaptation of the James M. Barrie story , it boast artistic , sophisticated animation that hold up brilliantly even compare to the contemporary computer-animated market . for instance , Peter Pan 's first appearance , crouch in darkness on a rooftop , suggest the character 's magical nature and even a subtle hint of the unknown and the potential for danger . the relationship between Peter , Wendy , Michael , and John give the movie tremendous heart . Peter 's companion sprite Tinkerbell be also meticulously draw and animated , and have garner she own place in Disney lore . Bobby Driscoll 's vocal work as Peter Pan be one of the finest , most recognizable voice in Disney 's canon of character . it be a perfect blend of mischief , stubborness , and most importantly , youth . Hans Conried do double duty as the villain Captain Hook and Mr. Darling , father to wendy , Michael , and John . in a animated setting , it be impossible to imagine anyone else in these role . Mr. Conried voice the fussy father very well , and as Captain Hook create one of Disney 's classic villain . he characterization be silkily evil , but he be also able to play the more comical side of the character . Kathryn Beaumont be perfection as wendy , a potent mixture of authority and genuine care in she voice . as one of the few female character from that earlier Disney era who be not a princess , the character of wendy be very interesting . emotionally strong and wise , Wendy Darling be one of Disney 's best female animated character . also feature great song like `` you can fly '' and `` follow the Leader , '' Walt Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' be one of the golden masterpiece from the company .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have have my Shake Weight for man for 2 day now and so far I really like it . the 6 minute dvd workout really do make you muscle burn ! and my arm definitely swell up after ward just as if I would be lift weight . I can not say what the effectiveness will be in the long run but I do not see how this could not beef someone up . one thing I 'll say be that I do not really feel a workout in my chest . I may have feel a little soreness there today but not much . the workout dvd go over 3 workout and the Shake Weight come with a card show those workout plus one more that be not demonstrate in the video . my plan be to do all 4 every day . maybe I will notice it in my chest more ? I do have concern that this could hurt someone back if they have have previous back injury but it do not seem to be bother mine . overall it be a well make product and I think it be go to do a good job make my arm a little more cut . and honestly it be a lot more fun to use than plain old lifting weight . 4 Stars ! oh and I notice someone else 's review say just to buy the female shake weight ... I do not get that because the one for man be 5lbs and the female version be 2.5 lb ... 11\/14\/10 Update I still think this be a good product . if anything I keep slip up and stop use it for a week or two . but my arm be definitely more define . especially my triceps ! I have never be able to see any definition in that area but they be bulge out now when I flex . I be go to try to stay devoted to do the workout twice a day now and really accelerate the muscle growth . a quick bit of info . . at first it may seem that it be slim down you arm . what I have notice be that it burn any fat off first and then the muscle growth begin . do not be discourage . even use it off and on I be definitely more tone than I ever be . I be gonna push this thing to the max and see just how rip it can make I .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	Dumbell bar arrive bent on the edge , this make it impossible for the clip to secure the weight . the large bar be great , weight be well balanced . if I have to pick between the the weight set with dumbell and the set without dumbell . I would definitely buy the one without dumbell .
Dumbbell	POS	5	excelente producto esto va para mis amigo los venezolanos que siempre hay dudas de los paquetes persona serias y todo es como sale compre con seguridad soy muy delicado con mis compras y quede fino ciando vi lo paquete
Dumbbell	POS	4	weight be great . the bench that I get with they be a serious pain to build . the mechanism for the weight be also a little tight but will loosen with usage .
Dumbbell	POS	4	these dumbbell holder work well with the corresponding dumbbell . it look great and hold up well to the weight . safe and effective . a bit expensive for a stand , but effective .
Dumbbell	POS	5	so i get these in yesterday this morning be the first time use they and i love my new weight !! so easy to change the weight and they be not big and bulky . just make sure the the pin be in the right spot and not crooked . but overall im very glad i purchase these !
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a must buy if you own a set of Bowflex dumbbell . I do not quite understand the frustration everyone else be talk about with the assembly . yes , it be not the clearest set of instruction in the world , but it be really straight forward . if you look at a picture of the assemble stand , you should be able to figure it out without a problem .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very easy to use straight out of the box . I personally enjoy do this in front of the tv . it be a great way to change you current upper body work out routine and keep thing interesting . Make sure to watch the instructional video a few time to avoid arm injury .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very happy with these hand weight . the color of the weight I receive differ from the picture - I have pink , blue , and purple . nice grip and plastic stand be easy to put together .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love this thing ! when i first get it i couldnt even use it for a minute cause the burning of my arm ! now they be get into great shape and my boyfriend have even try it a few time lol I recommend to all the woman in my family and share mine when I can ! would get if you want to tone up you arm !!
Dumbbell	POS	5	the weight do not slip out of my hand during my workout , and they arrive quickly . there be no weird oily residue like I have find with other coated weight and they be coat so I do not have to worry about rust or metal scratch my floor .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have purchase the smaller set of these dumbbell that go up to 24 pound as a gift last year however the gift recipient need heavier weight so I buy this set . the reason to not give it a 5 star rating be : this set start at 10 pound and adjust to 45 pound and the lighter set end at 24 pound so I feel that this set should have start at a heavier weight . the only other reason it do not get the extra star be that the stand for these much be purchase separately and they be not inexpensive . otherwise , it be a great product overall . they do not take up much space . they be easy to use . I have coworker that be personal trainer that actually recommenede they when I be ask to make sure it be worth the money . I receive my order within a few day of order and do not pay extra for expedited shipping .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I admit it , my biggest reason for have concern about buy this stand , be the concern of put it together . not that I have trouble in general , put thing together , but because I have a lot of review , not just here , but on a few sport store website as well , that say the instruction be horrible and that this stand be very hard to put together . I be not for sure if they be now put new instruction in with this stand , or if people just do not pay attention when put something together . for anyone concerned about the stand 's assembly , here be what come in the package . 3 different size bolt , 1 size of flathead bolts\/screws , each with the nut attach and 4 stack of washer that work with any of the bolt . that be it . what I do , I open the blister pack of hardware and put each type of bolt together . that take about 1 minute , see that you can lay the 3 type of bolt beside each other and tell the difference in the longer one . once I do this , one step use the biggest bolt , all of they . one step use the medium size bolt , all of they and one step use the smallest bolt , all of they . it be that simple . even better , the instruction and order of assembly start with the biggest bolt , then medium , then smallest . there be no way to screw that up since the smaller bolt be not long enough to fit the step require the bigger one . the one thing I will note be though the allen key be include , be sure to have a pair of small vice-grip or 7\/16 socket\/adjustable wrench , to hold the nut in place while tighten the bolt . the only part I find to be the least bit hard be put the towel stand in . as we start work against gravity and not have enough hand , on this part . I have no idea there be a towel stand , it be the last step , and require hold a curved bar under the dumbbell holder , while insert 4 flat head bolt . still , after a few time of drop the bolt , you will get it right . the stand be not exactly like that one picture . the one picture have more of satin silver color to it , but this one have more of a matte gray color , darker color . not a big deal , as it really work nicely for what it be suppose to do . total time of assembly 45 minute , include remove everything from box . just follow those direction and you will not have a bit of problem . one last note , it do include strap to hold the dumbbell down , so if you buy the dumbbell too , do not worry about cut the shipping restraint , that look just like the strap in the picture I have see with the dumbbell on the stand . great product so far .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I be surprise to see this item have positive review . I be happy that it apparently do work for some people . however , in my opinion , it be just another gimmick . shake you way to more muscular arm use something so light ? yes , you might feel something -lrb- and be careful that it be not pain due to injury that you be feel ! -rrb- but you can do this type of exercise use just about anything of the same weight -lrb- whether it be a water bottle or a can of soup , etc -rrb- . I do try this product and , personally , I recommend good old fashion push-up instead . specifically tricep push-up if you be aim to work on toning\/defining that `` under the arm '' area -lrb- below you biceps -rrb- . you have three different muscle in you tricep area -lrb- thus , the name , as `` tri '' mean `` three '' -rrb- . it be not logical to use a light weight dumbbell and `` shake '' you way to definition\/strength of all these muscle . nose crusher and dip be a few other exercise that be great for the triceps . this area can be a problem area for both man and woman but from my experience , more woman seem to be bother by it . dip would be perfect for woman who do not want to develop a more `` bulky '' appearance as you use you own body weight against you while nose crusher would be best for man as you can use the weight of you choice and keep increase it as you progress . -lrb- please note : dip be a common exercise , as be Nose Crushers , but Nose Crushers MIGHT be know by a different name by you personal trainer -rrb- . of course , tricep push-up be very effective for both sex . one of my main reason for be unhappy with this product be the very high risk of injury that can be cause from do these exercise . not just the chance of pull a muscle , but it also increase you chance of head , neck and shoulder injury -lrb- which take forever to recover from -rrb- . tricep push-up , dip & nose crusher be excellent exercise for the tricep muscle that do not have a high risk of injury to any of these area -lrb- with the exception of nose crusher - if you do not have a spotter and do drop the barbell on you nose , well , like the name of the exercise state , you nose will be crush ! -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	4	in just the first day of use this shake weight , I could feel my muscle be stress . however , I have only have this for a week , so no result yet .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy these for my -lrb- grow -rrb- son for he birthday and he love they . I mention that a few review say the size of the dumbbell make some exercise awkward at the limit of the movement , but he say he have not notice any problem . very happy with the quality , convenience , and compact storage .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	this be one of those product that will collect dust ! I find it very difficult to use as direct and be concern that I could hurt myself with it !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be not sure what happen to the instruction for many peoiple below , but we rack arrive within 2 day -lrb- I love Amazon Prime -rrb- and I build it last night in less than 30 minute . instruction be idiot simple -lrb- which be good for I ! -rrb- very clear , and all item be neatly package and lable -lrb- right and leave -rrb- . I use a 9\/16 ratchet and the supply allen wrnech and have everything button up very quickly and easily . I have to be honest , i continue to be blow away by the quality and construction of Bowflex equipment . we now have a pay of dumbell , and a Selectech Bench and I have be amaze at how solid and good look everything be . I be a reasonably serious weekend warrior , and at 275 pound , I be not gentle on anything -lrb- treadmill , eliptical , bench -rrb- . I be certain the Bowflex item we have add in the past few month will last a lifetime .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	Got lax and do not realize it be for one barbell , make assumption I be get two base off price . even with Prime 's free shipping and a 20 % discount one barbell cost more than pick it up locally . never have a problem with any Cap equipment and will continue to purchase they .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I be not sure how well this product work but it certainly be entertaining . it be much larger than the Women 's Shake Weight but not much heavier .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a great set to use at home on the day that I do not go to the gym . ship be quick , item arrive 5 day prior to the estimate delivery date . the weight be make of great material . the stand be a little cheap but I do not buy this set for the stand .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love the size of it as i can store it just about anywhere and yet be able to lift weight anywhere from 6-24 pound . the only problem with it as other have mention be that you might mess up get the pin in straight to adjust the weight but it be easy to figure out when u have mess it up . another annoying thing about the dumbbell set be while ur work out the plate hit each other and u hear a annoying clunk sound
Dumbbell	POS	4	after start a new workout program that need a variety of weight and live in a apartment complex , I do not have much room . after review many product and talk with people , i choose the power block for the variety of weight , compact size of the weight and be able to quickly choose the size weight I need be great . but mostly to know when lift the weight over my head , they will not fall off , the durability be excellent . this be a great buy .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	this be not for people that be start to work out ... you need to be well build to be able to move it freely . and grip of it be bad ... I use it now and then but at time it can really mess up you finger .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	i baught this think ok one of my trouble spot as a woman be my arm , well ... its boring , its funky weight and shape to use , the instructor Lindsey creap I no insperation to keep use the video . . now the dog like the use it as a chew toy . i have have WAY BIGGER result with boxing glove and bag work and jump roaping with weight on my arm . i wouldnt recomend this except as a paper weight or chew toy ... plus my guy friend give I crap with there pervert mind its dumb
Dumbbell	NEG	1	this product appear to be well make . it be not flimsy and all the part work well together . but that be it for the good news . the handle be make of hard , slippery plastic that make it difficult to hang on to after even the slightest sweat . in addition , the handle be oddly shape , make it very uncomfortable to hold on to with one or two hand . I be not sure what they have in mind when they design the handle . as far as the benefit of use , I can not comment as the machine be just too uncomfortable to use long enough to give a review on this point .
Dumbbell	POS	5	after do a fair amount of research and read the review I choose this apex dumbbell rack for my home gym and be not disappoint . it be rock solid , functionally build , and fit in nicely . for some reason the instruction say to use 2 adjustable wrench , when all you really need be one socket wrench and it easily assemble in about 15 minute . that 15 minute though do not count the 30 minute it take I to go to Lowes to replace 3 miss screw and 2 washer . the box have a sizeable hole rip open in it upon arrival and on top of that most of the screw and nut and washer that be there be loose , so obviously some fall out in transit . I be surprise I be not miss more . consider that I only pay $ 89 on Amazon for it with free shipping , I can deal with the miss part . it be hard to believe that such a well make product can be so poorly package though , but if you can make it beyond that then this be a great dumbbell rack .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I workout every single day and need equipment that be comfortable to use . neoprene barbell work great for I . I be slowly work my way up through the weight and you can not find 6 pound weight in my area . for some reason , they go from 5 pound to 8 pound but I can not make that big of a jump without hurt myself . so glad I find the 6 pounder online !
Dumbbell	POS	5	i order two 4lb dumbbell . i use they 3x a week to do arm exercise . they work for I and i like the neoprene coating .
Dumbbell	POS	4	you will `` feel the burn '' if you use the Shake Weight accord to direction . it will harden up you arm , chest , and choulder with continue -lrb- and proper -rrb- use , but do not be fool by the commercial . they show these huge bodybuilder dude use it and act as though they have just complete a pentathlon . believe it or not , not everyone will see through this exaggeration . the Shake Weight will , as I say , harden you up with continuous PROPER use , but it will not take you from couch potato to bodybuilder as the commercial seem to suggest . it be a decent workout on you schedule . overall , I be happy with the product , but not happy with the commercial ; it be market a little too well ...
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I guess they serve the purpose , but do not be a fool get something of better quality . the bar come in two piece . . so retard ,
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order my powerblock weight because I need more option and fewer weight lie around . I love these weight . very easy to use . I have be use they in my workout several time a week and no problem encounter . my boyfriend even start use they ! I highly recommend this item .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have purchase the 3 lb a while back , and I finally feel ready to graduate to something heavier , so I get the 5 lb . as be the case with the older set , this be a good and useful product . they do not roll and be comfortable to hold .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be a `` young '' almost 62-year-old . while I be pretty fit , I have notice , and worried about , lose muscle mass . I see this on a `` health '' website I subscribe to . buy it for $ 30 at Walgreens . figure that for $ 30 it be a good risk . in two word : it work ! although I be not fanatical about it -lrb- use it every three day or so -rrb- it have make a noticeable difference . -lrb- Disclaimer : it will not turn a couch potato into Mr. America . -rrb- about two week after get it , my wife and I be at she family reunion on the beach in La Jolla , see family and cousin we see 2-3 time a year . I be curious if it would be notice without my say anything . it be notice ! everyone remark on how `` buff '' I look . Pretty good endorsement ! I think I might have help sell a few . key point : as the first part of the dvd point out , you must grip the shake weight tightly . if you hold it lightly , you can shake all night and it will not help . I wonder if people who say it do not work be grip it lightly ...
Dumbbell	POS	5	when this product first come out ... it be the laughing stock of the world . nobody take it seriously and the motion that you have to make to exercise with this weight make for great joke ! however , I recently read in the newspaper that this weight really do work . 2 trainer give they professional opinion -lrb- 1 male and 1 female -rrb- and they say the result you get be amazing . it work the muscle in a way that no other weight can . I decide to purchase it and cross my finger . I must say ... my husband and I reach for this weight at every bored moment we get . so easy to do during commercial while watch tv after the kid be in bed . a hour show have about 20 minute of commercial and use this weight for those 20 minute -lrb- stop while the show be on -rrb- really get you a great work out without overwhelming you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have have these weight for just over 2 week and they be nothing short of fantastic . very easy to switch from 5 to 45 pound to optimize a workout . I have already lose two inch off my waist thanks to these and a new diet . I would definitely recommend these
Dumbbell	POS	5	I make fun of this weight when it first come out because the workout look ridiculous , but then i research into the product , read many rave review -lrb- and many also claim it be a ridiculous look workout but that it work !! -rrb- and how this thing have work for they . I like work out but my busy shedule limit I from do hour of workout so with this 6 minute workout i can fit it right in before i go to sleep . I feel the burn and my muscle be sore the follow day . I will come back and review this again after a few month to tell of the outcome of this product and how it have work for I . but so far this product be do it be job .
Dumbbell	POS	4	my hubby ask for the Shake weight dumbbell , to add to he `` weight be '' collection ... it come as promise , on time and he love it . I try it for about 2 min and my arm be sore ! defiantly work . : o -rrb-
Dumbbell	NEG	1	when I receive the apex rack , it have obviously be use . everything be out of the packaging , and be rewrapped lazily and quickly . all of the bolt and washer be loose in the box , and some be suprisingly miss . the rack be scratch and dent , probably since it be use previously . I buy this as a new item , but it be not even close . very disappointing .
Dumbbell	POS	4	after read all of the review of this product , only a few of they match my experience . I receive the first weight rack and realize that one of the screw-hole be miss on the frame , make it impossible to properly assemble the rack . also , the box look quite beat up , and the part bag be open and sloppy ; not a good first impression , although all part be account for . we go through amazon and return it to we -lrb- very local -rrb- UPS store , and receive a new product in 2 day without any hassle , so as with all of my experience with amazon , it be quite pleasant . I have a relatively small apartment and the weight rack be right in the living room corner . I do not notice any overpowering chemical odor , and the rack itself be quite sturdy for my purpose -lrb- 50lb , 25 's , 20 's on bottom rack , 15 's , 10 's on middle , 8 's and 5 's on top -rrb- . it be very easy to assemble -lrb- one possible exception be the rubber foot , they be a bit tough to get on -rrb- and do not look bad either . I have have it for a month now , use it 5 day a week , and do not have any issue with this product . I would call it a good purchase for the money , and amazon make life easy . I give this product 4 star solely because the first one I receive be defective . if it be not defective , I would have easily give this 5 star .
Dumbbell	POS	5	after read several review for various dumbbell rack , I finally settle on this product . it be well build for a home gym , easy to put together , and look professional . Hex type weight be the best fit . once you move to smaller `` plastic or vinyl cover '' weight , they do not fit as well . overall , I be very pleased and feel the rack be well worth the money !
Dumbbell	NEG	1	poorly make in china with cheap plastic . Broke 5 minute into the first use . very disappoint . I like the idea of the shake bell . Wish to find another brand for this .
Dumbbell	POS	5	not sure why other reviewer have trouble with the assembly , but with basic tool it be no problem . product quality be good and the stand be attractive . make use the weight set alot more pleasurable , and worth the investment to save you back .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be use this product for about a week now and it do exactly what it say it do , you feel the burn on you arm and shoulder after each 6 minute workout . I have belong to gym in the past and they claim that what it take 42 minute in the gym you get in 6 minute with the Shake Weight be very accurate ! I see a lot of people panning this product on vary site , but for the price I figure I would give it a shot and it work like a charm ! all I can say be that people who say this do not work never actually try this ! definately recommend this as a good way to get definition in you arm !
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have be use this dumbbell set for several month now , along with some more standard dumbbell and a Bowflex weight bench . while I prefer the feel of standard dumbbell , this set be very compact to store and it be very easy to adjust the weight for specific exercize . I feel that they give I just as good a workout as any dumbbell I have use , even if they be a bit too bulky to use for wrist curl and other short range of motion exercize . for the standard bicep curl , bench press , overhead press and the like , I highly reccomend .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I buy these to add a little more challenge to my step aerobic . it be help to bring my heart rate up faster and help to tone my arm , which be exactly what I be look for . I like the neoprene coating since the weight do not get slippery even when I start sweating . my only complaint would be that the stand be a little flimsy . even so , I be happy with the value I get for my money . I may be buy another set because my husband have also start use they during we workout and we sometimes want the same weight .
Dumbbell	POS	5	after much research on adjustable dumbbell I end with the Powerblocks . I try several adjustable dumbbell at the store but nothing can come close to these . I be very pleased with these as they be very functional and quality make . adjust the weight be very fast and easy . they take up very little room compare to traditional dumbbell . if you want easy to use adjustable dumbell , quality make product , and save space than these be the Ultimate Dumbells for you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be look for a dumbbell rack that would fit in we bedroom and not be obtrusive . this item look good so I decide to use a $ 100 Amazon gift card to hold my set of dumbbell I have accumulate over time . the package come via UPS . it be well package . after open it and look at the instruction , it take about 15 minute to assemble with a socket wrench . it be simple to put together . I really like the size and color . it have a elegant finish , not the raw steel look you see in most gym . the most important thing for I be that it fit all of my dumbbell . after try this out and switch weight around for my optimal configuration , here be how I have the dumbbell place on each row . top row : -lrb- 4 -rrb- 5 lb , -lrb- 3 -rrb- 8 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 10 lb Middle Row : -lrb- 2 -rrb- 30 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 35 lb , 10 lb medicine ball Bottom Row : -lrb- 2 -rrb- 15 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 20 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 25 lb note : I put my heavy dumbbell on the 2nd row so I do not have to bend over to much to pick they up . I be not able to fit my -lrb- 2 -rrb- 25 lb dumbell on the 2nd row with the 30 and 35 , so I put the medicine ball there . if you have more dumbbell than what I have describe , you may want to buy something bigger . I be really happy with this purchase . Hope this review help .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I purchase two of these weight and the color do not match between the weight . they look like two different shades of purple . it be not a big deal , but a little irritating . try the Body solid vinyl dumbbell instead .
Dumbbell	POS	5	Amazon be superb in deliver quality product such as this on from Bowflex . I order this for my husband and he love it !! recommend it to all who use exercise equipment .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be skeptical of whether or not the product would measure up to the hype , and I be pleasantly surprise . I see result after as little as a week . I have be use it for a little more than a month now , only do the basic six minute workout and the definition and muscle gain have exceed expectation . at first , the exercise be a little difficult but the more you do they , obviously the easier they get . for as much effort as you have to put into it , you get more than double the result . I know this be a little redundant but I be always concern about review and I want this one to really assure you . for the price , I would definitely buy it again , if I ever have to .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	it need to be a big bigger and have pad for the dumbbell but for the price I can not complain .
Dumbbell	POS	4	these work well for a quick workout when I can not make it to the fitness club . one of the box 's of the 25 lb dumbbell be almost break in half when I receive it but the weight appear undamaged . good quality , and I just end keep the wrapper around the handle because it feel like the grip be sandpapery without glove -- not that I ever use lift glove anyway , but the wrap make they feel comfortable .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	sorry but this be a great idea , however it should come in different weight size etc. . its very light weight . I really would have use it if it would have be heavier . HOWEVER for those just start out exercise and need to build up , its a great toy to burn some calorie . it shake with ease and there be alot of arm position you can use to start . they just need to make some adjustment for more muscle building . I guess you can use this to practice you grip control on a spouse , but hey I have a headache !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	everyone else have expound the benefit of this item with the one con be the instruction . certainly I scratch my head especially with the strap . -lrb- btw you have to unsnap the longer strap and loop the side without the snap through and then use the snap to secure it to the stand . -rrb- I would like to point out a few more con . 1 . the packaging and paint job from the manufacturer be terrible . Mine arrive with multiple paint ding and a destroy bowflex sticker . the bubble wrap provide only minimal protection give the shipping weight . the box easily tear by the UPS guy and I be surprised everything be still there when I open it . 2 . it also have multiple cosmetic paint abnormality such as bubble and run . the paint be also different shades than the bench and the weight . come on , how hard be it to paint the bench and stand the same color ! 3 . the stand tilt the weight forward make it harder to replace the handlebar on the stand if you have a weight that be sandwich between other . this happen because the weight lean . I have the 1090 set . 4 . it be too low and narrow . I be only 5 ' 7 '' and I have to bend down to get the weight . also because of how close they be it be more difficult to assume a correct posture . still it be a lot better than have they on the floor . in all I be expect more than I get but , be a physical therapist , I think you would be a fool to not have something to set these 90 # beast on .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I get this for one of my grandson 's for Christmas . he have be look at they at Walmart , he mother say . I like yours better than the Walmart one and I think it be a little cheaper . he seem to like it . it be heavy !! I think woman use these too for they arm . ship be fast and it be pack well . thanks .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	what a nightmare when I open the box ! the bolt , washer and nut be scatter all over the box . as expect , most of the piece be miss . I be also not able to find any square end Cap . the left and right beam be also scratch and the base of the beam be dent . I be not even sure if I be able to fit in the base end cap . these be just some of the few thing I have notice upon quick inspection . not sure what else be miss or wrong with the rack . I be return the item . what a waste of my time .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the shake weight can be use by people who have never go to gym or play professional or nonprofessional sport . the Weight do not weight that much so it make the rep hard to do . if you want to really add the pressure to a area then all it take be more effort instead of more actual weight . I would suggest the Shake Weight to other .
Dumbbell	POS	5	you see the commercial and I guess the actor be better at it than me , THEY LOOK LIKE IT 's MOTORIZED . oh well , it be not , BUT you still feel it work . take ALOT of EFFORT , BUT KEEP IT up and you 'll see result .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have have these for a while now , and for the most part , I like they . they be a reasonable compromise between individual weight dumbbell and other , more expensive , adjustable weight . it be easy to select the desire weight and with a maximum of 24 pound per dumbell , you can get a good amount of resistance for most common dumbbell exercise . the minor complaint I have be that they could have a bit more room between the rod that connect the weight disc , as my knuckle can sometime rub against they unless I hold it in just a certain way , and also it be not always easy to get the weight selector `` thingie '' in the right place . other than that , a far less expensive option than Bowflex .
Dumbbell	POS	5	excellent product for the money . since it be one piece nothing can loosen and fall off . they be coat with , I be guess , a epoxy . it have a smooth surface a will not rust . so they be no maintenance , and do what they be suppose to ; what more can you ask . a good value .
Dumbbell	POS	5	excellent product - i love to workout and now have some additional piece of workout gear . excellent quality and identical to those use by most gym i have be to .
Dumbbell	POS	5	great dumbbell set , make I use they a lot since its nicely set up with the stand and doesnt let I forget about it , since i keep it in front of my eye . great set . truly recommend .
Dumbbell	POS	4	Ok so I find mine at target , i be a woman and I buy the men one , I do not purchase to reduce arm flab I actually purchase to increase endurance\/stamina\/strength in the arm and shoulder as I be a Echocardiographer , basically what that mean be a ultrasound tech that scan the heart , and you guess it ... I have to scan under heavy obese breast ... to get to the heart and no the patient can not always hold they own up they might be unconscious , and anyone that be have one know that we have to push hard between rib pace for extended period to get image -lrb- while hold up those boob with the same arm -rrb- I be a new grad and boy be I in for a surprise at how weak I be !!!!!!!!!!! I can not endure more than 10 minute and not push hard means crappy picture which mean angry cardiologist and we have to do 10 a day for 30 minute each ... yike !! this be my answer . I get the men one because those boob usually weigh more than the female version and I be try to create endurance with that add weight like I say . I have do it two day now and my shoulder , biceps , triceps , pectoral , trap and lat all ache !!! whether or not the flab go anywhere this be definately a good workout for what I need .
Dumbbell	POS	5	just another success in a continuous stream of product order from Amazon , my preferred retailer . the time , traffic and deal with people require to go to the store ? forget about it . Amazon be my `` go to '' move for any retail purchase . price , speed and reliability be Amazon 's trademark quality .
Dumbbell	POS	4	my wife be very pleased with she shake weight . she use it every night , and feel more energize after a few minute of use , particularly after a tiring day 's work .
Dumbbell	POS	5	Ok , here be the truth as I have no agenda to either endorse or kill this product : I allow myself to get a bit out of shape and as I have finally turn the corner and make marked improvement in my diet and physique , I notice that my upper arm be flabby , and I allow they to become weak . I be skeptical of this product , but I decide to give it a try . when I do the first 6 minute workout , I manage to breeze through it , and I foolishly believe I be in better shape than I think . the next day however prove I wrong , as I find the repetition of the routine actually become harder . I also discover that I do indeed have a weak arm which could not match the other . I feel the burn and fatique after the 6 minute exercise program each time I do it . but then , by week three , I find myself do the 6 minute program 2 or 3 time a day , and though I be still not breeze through it as I do on day 1 , I be manage to complete the entire program . I also be do some add rep on my weak arm and I have manage to balance the two . now , after a month I be not go to say that I be suddenly rip , of course not , but I do notice something . at a moment when I be simply soap my upper arm , I discoverd that they be more `` solid '' and `` tight '' than they be a few short week prior . Let 's face it , you know you own body , so when you discover a change , without even consciously look for one , you become a bit startled . well , I be , and realize that there be some definite toning to my arm . I be also move the shake weight harder than I be thus increase my strength , and try new routine . so , have the product now for about two month , i continue my three 6 minute a day routine and be feel much better do it . I have find that it be a great motivator and one of the few weight regimen that be not boring . after all , if you can not spare at least 6 minute of you day do this program , then what do you want to do ? highly recommend ... ... .
Dumbbell	POS	4	unless you have a table or counter to put these weight on , it be just not good for you back . when re-racking weight and have to put it back on the floor . this rack be build for the dumbbell and function as it be . the wheel be very helpful when need to wheel these thing around . especially for cleaning . very stable .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I purchase the stand from another site - as a factory refurbish item . I be able to save about $ 40 that way , but alas , the stand come with no instruction . I be unable to get a response on obtain the instruction from Bowflex -lrb- in they defense , I grow impatient wait and I do not buy it from they -rrb- . I print a photo of the stand and have often use the zoom feature here on Amazon 's photo to figure out the assembly . it be pretty straight forward - but you do have to be careful which screw you put where . there be several that look the same , but be slightly different in length . in fact , the only problem I have with assembly - I have never use lock nut before and could not figure out how you get those dumb thing on ! but that be a malfunction on my part - not the stand ! I will say , aside from not know how to use a lock nut , I be relatively mechanically orient and find assembly of item very easy . I also enjoy assemble thing and find the assembly without instruction to be a nice brain exercise ! the stand itself be sturdy . it defintely help reduce strain on you lower back - worth the cost if you ask I . I also like the wheel on the bottom so I can move it out of the way from my child . I like the option standard foot though - I can see a time when I would like it to not be move around . but for now , we have to use the wheel . I also like the strap on the stand . I believe they be to keep the plate of the dumbbell in place so that they do not lift when you be lift heavier weight . BUT I have discover they be so simple to remove and re-attach , that I take they up over the dumbbell when not use the weight . this prevent little child from attempt to lift the weight . as I do not have the instruction , not sure if this be intend or recommend , but it work for we . I do not personally use the weight - they be for my husband -lrb- who be out of town for a while - thus why I assemble the stand -rrb- . so I can not comment on the stand during use .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have surgery on my shoulder , and my physical therapist recommend this for my home exercise . it be not mean to create a lot of weight to bulk up with -lrb- like it show in the advertisement -rrb- but it create enough resistance to build endurance and tone muscle , which be exactly what my deteriorated shoulder muscle need .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I like the convenience and effectiveness of this simple work-out . I can pick it up and use it anywhere and feel great . the best feature be that it have improve my posture like nothing else have - after four spinal injure and other back problem , I have work physical therapy and other machine and have strengthe my back , yet this be the best ever for improve posture . I usually use it longer that the 6 minute , although it be good to start out that length of time . thank you Shake Weight !
Dumbbell	POS	5	Powerblock Classic 5-45 set work great when you have the stand . I finish p90x with it , it be all I need in the weight dept. . I recommend get the stand . it be a bit cumbersome to change weight setting if you sit these weight on the carpet , whereas on a hard surface , it be a simple and quick change . with the routine I have be do , you need to quickly change the weight sometimes , and with the stand , the weight be at a comfortable height , just perfect . without the stand , change weight setting be a chore .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I receive this stand free with my dumbell . the stand be well build and be a usefull addition to my work out room . the stand be easy to assemble . so easy that my 14 year old child assemble it with out my help in less time than it take for I to take a shower . the only thing I would like to see different on this stand be I would like it to be about 10 inch taller . I be over 6 foot and the stand while still very usable be a bit on the short side . it should be the perfect size if you be in the 5 foot range . still be a bit shour it be much better than store the weight on the floor . the wheel make it nice to move it around when I want to vacuum or just have it out of the way .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a great product . I do not receive the cd with the dumbbell , but be sure it would help to have that . however , I have be use it and have wonderful result . L.
Dumbbell	POS	5	if you have the SelectTech dumbbell I highly recommend obtain the stand . my main reason be to eliminate possible lower back injury : this stand place the weight at the perfect height -lrb- I be 6 ' 0 '' -rrb- . finally , do not listen to any of the other review concern the assembly process ; if you read the instruction and lay out the component assembly should only take about half a hour .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	I find the weight hard to use , the shake motion do not go as smooth as it appear when you see it on tv .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have get the shake weight for man and I absolutely love it . I use it every day and I actually feel sore after use if for about 10 minute . I can see some definition start to come in my arm that I have never see before . obviously it look a little strange but if you have not try it already then I recommend you do !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I finally get permission from my wife to purchase this stand . I enjoy the fact that it have wheel and I can set the stand in front of the tv as I work out , and then effortlessly wheel it out of sight afterwards . it save my back , as I no longer need to pick up the dumbbell off the floor . I think the direction for put it together be adequate .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order product on mon get it on thu ! awesome ! some review state the direction be difficult I however be a picture person I be able to put it together in about 40min or so juggle attention to kid and back to assembly ... over all happy
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order this and its great and can be use in so many way . ithought it be battery operate but nope . so dont have to worry about run to the store time after for battery , i recommend this if you be tryng to build up they biceps !
Dumbbell	NEG	2	IM NOT A WEAK PERSON BUT I just feel like this be hard to use and CONTROL . while I be do it it be bounce around all over the place I have to DO VERY SMALL MOVEMENTS or IT FEEL LIKE ITS just all over the place and my husband be like your not do it right ! BUT if I do it the other way it sway front and back I mean you CAN FEEL your muscle work BUT THIS PRODUCT be just not for me
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a excellent rack for a home gym . it be not as big as some other , but for a home gym with 8-10 set of dumbell it be perfect . the weight be easy to get to and the frame be very stable .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love my shake weight ! honestly one of the best -lrb- and quickest -rrb- upper body workout I have ever use ! I buy mine about a month ago . slack in the beginning , but I have be use it faithfully -lrb- once a day -rrb- for the last two week , and I have already see a difference ! I be a little upset that I do not do it everyday since I first buy it ! if you think about get one , definitely do ! it be worth it ! -lrb- head up : the dvd say six minute , but it be really ten ! -rrb- so what be ten minute a day ?! = -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	4	I purchase this set for use with Chalean Extreme and they work great . good quality product . it be easy and quick to change weight and I have have no problem with they after 5 month of use 3 time per week . couple of thing to note . they do need to be store on a hard service ; place on carpet make it very difficult to change the weight set . only thing I would change would be the grib when hold a single weight overhead with both hand . it be hard to place both hand on or inside the weight and get a comfortable hold . otherwise , for the quality and money spend , this set can not be beat !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy the Shake Weight a week ago and already I be notice result ! I have more definition in my biceps . the 6 minute work out be really quick but I feel like I be get a way better arm workout than I would at the gym . I will continue to use this product !
Dumbbell	POS	5	upon weigh the accessibility of the gym near I against the cost of membership , I decide to try figure out what step I can do at home to aid in get start with fitness . I look up some exercise online for dumbbell , and then search Amazon for some starter kit . I be weak . I admit it . so this seem to be the perfect beginner set . the free shipping alone make this a sweet deal . the weight arrive extremely quick and before the original expected date . the stand be a bit flimsy , but it be small enough to be push into a corner and seem to hold the weight with no trouble . the weight themselves be comfortable and the perfect size for I . I think this be a great tool for any beginner to get start with .
Dumbbell	POS	5	my husband buy these for I , and they be great . I mean , what else do you expect from 5-lb dumbbell ? they work for I !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order the entire set for my Husband for he birthday . the bench , dumbbell and this stand . be like he die and go to GYM HEAVEN . he love each piece . the stand be great to hold the dumbbell , which u really need .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	just toss this piece of c -- p in the garbage !!!! what a waste !!!! spend the extra money on a better brand .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I orginially buy this for my son who keep say how much he want it . . he love and as do i. . I use it just as much as he do . thank you !
Dumbbell	NEG	2	this be 1 hand weight , not a set of 2 hand weight . this be include in the product information , but I have get into a bad habit of read review and not the product info . I be give it a low rating , because it seem intentionally mislead to offer only 1 weight instead of a set . of course , after receive the product , I order another to complete the set -lrb- which be probably the seller 's goal , but it would be a hassle for I to return instead -rrb- . I would not have choose this product for the price if I have realize it be not a set . however , if you only need one weight , this one seem like a nice quality .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the shake wieght will definately work you , and wear you out !!! it be a great deal !!! I use it regularly , and you can actually feel the result , you 'll tigthten up quickly use it , you 'll love it . its a excellent way to stay in shape !
Dumbbell	POS	4	after use it for a week , I have notice a definite improvement in my muscle development . it take a lot of energy to shake this item . well , my muscle be sore . for mature individual who be wheelchair bind like I , I recommend this as a additional aid for exercise . I find the shaker very useful and the total price with free shipping the best reason to get it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have have these Powerblocks for five year . I use they just about everyday . combine with a good quality bench there be not much you can not do with these . they be a staple in any exercise equipment arsenal . they save a tremendous amount of space and clutter compare to individual dumbbell . they be very reliable , but you do need to move the retain pin with care and not in haste , as if you get it engage across multiple section it could be a dangerous situation when you lift they up -lrb- this have happen to I a few time but be really not a huge issue -rrb- . once engage with the desire weight , they stay together nicely and they feel solid and do not rattle . I like to do tricep extension while standing , and in the gym I can pick up a single traditional dumbbell and hold it by its end with both hand and lower it behind my head and then do the extension . that be the only exercise that be somewhat difficult to do with the Powerblocks , due to the limited space to grasp the weight end of the Powerblock . but that be a minor nit . they be indestructible , and with the exception of a few scratch on the side , look and operate like the day that I buy they . as state earlier , I use these almost daily , so they have serve I very well . in my new house , we have a actual gym with rubber floor and lot of space but I see no reason to not continue to use these powerblock due to they compactness and ease of use . I find the soft grip to very comfortable and I also like the way they feel in my hand and the way they provide lateral support since the Powerblock slightly rest on you wrist area when lift they . slight downside be that I have max they out , as most probably will if you strength train regularly , so I find myself want more weight . highly recommend this product .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I have purchase both the shake weight for woman , and version for man . . they do the same thing , and do give you the work out that will `` over time '' give you definition and size . . I dont think the market need a Mens version , and to charge $ 20 more for it be label for man do not convince I either . I purchase to see if it be in fact a drastic improvement verse the original , and I didnt notice any such variable that would make I recommend it over the ORIGINAL Shake weight that be market towards woman . I mean before the male version come out , Charles Barkley a TNT guy be co-sign the female version during the NBA season . . Nuff Said ! lol !
Dumbbell	NEG	1	go to use for the first time and it fall apart . try to fix but do not work the same . very poorly make or get a faulty one . would not recommend to anyone .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have see great improvement in my arm from this shake weight . arm be no longer flabby . it be easy to use , I always exercise to the include dvd , only 6 minute . this work much better than equipment at the gym and traditional weight .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I receive the Shake Weight for a Easter gift . I have be work with it every morning for about a week - be careful with the single arm exercise , as some other customer have warn to do , and I can see a difference in my arm already . the 6-minute work-out do produce a fairly deep burn feeling in my arm muscle , but I have notice that I recover much better while I be take collagen :  Bovine Collagen , 120 capsule  most of the complaint I have read about the Shake Weight would probably be eradicate if a user view the video instruction , which come with the Shake Weight , before attempt to use the weight . it require practice but the Weight do work - if you do .
Dumbbell	POS	5	want dumbbell for home use , but not a separate pair for every 5-pound increment -lrb- would require more space , have to build a rack for they , out of place in multi-purpose room , etc. -rrb- . the PowerBlocks give I 5 to 45 lb . per dumbbell , change easily in seconds , have even weight distribution with padding around wrist , stay securely attach , and be easily store when not in use . no complaint .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	if you be like I and want to buy this dumbbell because of its great commercial , please be aware that it be total waste . I buy it not for shake weight but for my every day exercise . absolutely no result and you feel like a retard every time shake it and hope it would do something . although it be hard to shake in the beginning , it do not do anything to the body that you see in commercial .
Headphone	POS	4	I buy these for a long plane ride to St. Thomas . I use they with my ipod and I be very happy with my purchase . the volume level be great . I never need to raise the volume past 2\/3rd 's on my ipod . I try several headphone include my friend 's qc2 's and even though he sound quality may be slightly better , I could not get the volume on the bose to go high enough to enjoy watch a movie on my ipod . however , the sound quality on these Sennheiser 's be far better than anything else I have try in the past . also , even after use they for 3 hour , my ear do not hurt and they never get hot or sweaty . as far as the noise cancel part , BOSE win hand down . but it be still ok . it do a fair job of reduce jet engine noise , but do not cancel out voice around you . the main reason that I even buy these be because Consumer Reports rate they as a best buy overall . I can definetely see why .
Headphone	NEG	2	the Bonging Sound Noise when you use the + volume control - be very annoying and it drive ME NUTS . now I do not use the headset volume + when I want to increase the volume - I have resort to have to use the ipod volume control - this be annoying also since I be suppose to be able to use the headset control . maybe I be just too picky .
Headphone	NEG	1	this be probably the worst frackalakin piece of blacoopa i have eva wakalaking snakin ever get . I mean this headphone so bad its be very bad . I hate its headphone gut . you understand I heaphone I hate you soo much you can go die in a frazinglining hole .
Headphone	NEU	3	after play video game and listen to music with these headphone constantly for the past 3 day , I would rate they 3.5 out of five star if possible , add the extra .5 for the nice fit\/construction construction : for a pair of over the head , full size headphone , these do feel very light , and snug withought be too tight . the cord be thin , and the length be a nice medium . as you can see in the picture the ear fold up and inward into the headband to keep these somewhat portable . there be a very convenient net that keep the folding headband from snag you hair , as well as contribute to the nice snug fit feeling . sound : the sound in general be mediocre . they do sound good , but I have a feeling that some of the increase in quality I be experience be simply because I be use to you standard non-enclosed headphone . I notice the base be strong in video game , but not in music . for example , Whenever I play say , Battlefield 2142 ... the explosion , heavy artillery fire\/tank shell , and the thud ground-pound of the mech walk around sound fantastic , but they tend to overpower other sound effect . however , when play music -lrb- 128 kbp AAC 's -rrb- I do not notice the super-strong base , however it do sound better than you standard headphone . it should be note that 128kbp be not full quality music , yet it have become the standard for download for file size vs. quality . Price vs. performance : it be a nice balance . you be not spend very much on these , and you be get performance may not be great , but certainly not bad . my opinion be that if you be on a budget or not willing to spend a whole lot on headphone , but want to make sure you be get decent sound quality , then these be a solid and justifiable buy . however , if you be a impulsive buyer , be strong and just hold off until you can afford to spend more . this be my first pair of enclosed-ear headphone and while satisfied for now , I foresee a newer , probably twice as expensive pair in my not too distant future .
Headphone	POS	5	I buy these for my son , after he very extensive research into find the best quality headphone on the market . without a doubt , these be not only a great value for the price but in any price range . the sound be amazing ! as a hat off to Amazon : these be actually a little hard to find ... not only do you have they , but they be at a discounted price . they also arrive on the exact date on the shipping confirmation .
Headphone	NEU	3	I buy this for watch the tv . the sound quality be amazing . I like the head set overall . the only problem be , you have to tune every time you power on the headset . it will not save the frequency once you set it . good for those who want to watch tv or play game with best sound .
Headphone	POS	5	awesome . amazing . comfortable . gorgeous sound . be it worth the steep price ? well , the money would be waste on doe-eyed soft-haired teen idol but definitely well spend Pink Floyd ! ; -rrb-
Headphone	NEG	1	Review update after 6 + month of product ownership : have use these on 6 domestic trip about 2 international trip of 8 + hr to Europe and Asia . I try the bose qc-15 for about 2 week and then I have now use these for 2 trip ... and here be my conclusion : 1 -rrb- Noise Cancelling : these be no bose ... there be a significant different between the Noise cancelling of this one vs. the bose . so you get what you pay for . these do not seem to get rid of all the `` white noise '' like on a airplane etc. . noise be my primary need ... and these do a ok job but not outstanding . 2 -rrb- comfort : Bose win ... these SUCK . wear these on a extended flight and after about 2 hour , with Audio Technica , I have to keep take they off to give my ear some rest . this part be really annoying and that be why I have change my review from 3 star to 1 star . after 2 hour , you ear will be burn ... the stretch band across the top be not long enough and will start to dig into you brain ... just miserable on comfort what good be any other feature of noise cancel if these can not be worn . 3 -rrb- music : not my specialty . both play music , with Audio-Technica , the good thing be that it play even when it be turn off ... so if you battery die on a long trip , you can still use these for listen to you music , but with bose , you would be SOL . 4 -rrb- cost : these be about half of the bose ... so you get what you pay for . on further consideration , because of the comfort issue , you do not want to use these after a while , so you do not really even get what you pay for at half the price . I do not want these to get cheaper ... but why can not these guy make they more comfortable . who decide to make the head-strap to NOT be very long ? who decide not to use the softer padding over the ear ? and why be not the ear-cup a little bigger to surround my ear better . I be ready to try on-ear model and see how that do . Consumer Reports rate even the Audio-Technica on-ear model better than these . what a disappointment , do not waste you money . I 'll be put mine up for sale on e-bay if anyone want they .
Headphone	POS	4	first , the good part . these be the second set of Jensen headphone I have purchase . they be a very good value compare to some of the other I have try . the downside be that the signal will very slowly drift over the life of the battery , but usually a slight tap of the tuning knob will bring it back . the newer model like this one appear to have better signal aquisition , so this may solve some of the drift problem I see in older model . battery life be pretty good , I usually go through a set every 6-7 day on the old one . -lrb- the old model require 3 aaa 's instead of 2 however -rrb-  now the bad , the production value be rather poor on the electronics in these headphone . my first pair start go rather glitchy on I , sometimes I would have to lightly hit the side to get they to find the signal again , and the battery life start go down drastically . it also would rapidly lose signal when it have this problem . I take they apart and notice that the soldering job be quite substandard , and there be several uninsulated speaker wire that be short out . after put some insulation in on the board , the headphone start work perfectly . I take these apart after I recieve they and notice the same problem . the headphone be also pop loose from its plastic fitting due to substandard glue . both easily fixable if you be good with electronics .
Headphone	POS	4	pro : relatively inexpensive comparatively sound great comfortable even with my big head keep outside noise out pretty well Cons : velour earpad can make you head HOT outside of headphone have no noise dampen - anyone nearby can hear what you be listen to I be happy with the headphone in spite of the con - because at pretty much any volume the headphone put out sound through the back of the earpad and anyone nearby can hear . I wish the velour earpad do not turn my head into a furnace , but all over the ear headphone be bad to some extent , and the velour be more comfortable . people complain about the long cord but I have come to expect that with high quality headphone and it be actually beneficial in one scenario so I 'll live with it . if you want great sound at a reasonable price and do not care if anyone else would get bother by the noise , then these be a great buy .
Headphone	NEU	3	good for speech or other non music use . plastc headband not very comfortable for extend use . low price make this headset disposable and worth buying . probably good for kid use .
Headphone	POS	5	first let I say great review J. governalus . for the fool sit in you room think these be go to block out you mom yell at you ... try read the manual . if you have not try the noise cancel on a airplane or another noisy low freq form of transportation , do not write a review .
Headphone	POS	4	these headphone have work great . my husband love they because he can hear the show better and I love they because the tv be not roar and hurt my ear anymore . they charge easily and have great range . Terrific product .
Headphone	POS	4	i take away a star because the bud get a little uncomfortable after a couple of hour and i do not like the intermediate connection in the headphone wire . the sound quality be excellent for use with a laptop\/mp3 player . great for jogging and workout . no noise reduction feature but it be much safer that way at the gym and the road .
Headphone	POS	5	this be a great idea to swim listen to music i be so glad i buy this
Headphone	NEU	3	do not let the name sennheiser fool you . this product be make in China . I be excite about get these earbud , see the name Sennheiser and think it be a bargain at the price . well , there be a reason . so I be try to prevent the next person from make the same mistake . these be NOT German make earbud . other critique : not as comfortable in the ear as other have suggest . I can wear it for 2 hour before my ear start hurt . sound quality not any more special then standard apple earbud . most importantly : durability . how long will these earbud last I until one or both side go deaf ? I do not know , I just get these . I will come back to this review to let you know . sennheiser do offer 2 year warranty , so that be good .
Headphone	POS	4	I have be use these ear bud and I like they both at home and at work . they work well to reduce the constant hum of nearby computer , distant conversation etc. . they help I keep my train of thought . I also like the fact that I can save my ear because I do not have to turn up music as high . chatter beyond 10ft away mostly disappear . I be surprise by the static buzz they produce , but the noise cancel outweigh that . type seem to stand out as the most audible noise . it seem to work best on constant rumble or hum noise . it seem as if everything noisy around you get push back 20 foot . UPDATE : the left earbud stop work . Sony will gladly replace the set for a processing fee of $ 46 . I be downgrade this product from 4 star to 1 star .
Headphone	NEU	3	they be ok . for $ 15 or so , they be great for the price but as a whole , just ok . I prefer my phillip in ear `` virtual surround sound '' better .
Headphone	POS	5	I also own a pair of the sr60us headphone , which be just a step below in quality and price , so I be already a fan of Grado before I buy these . I want to try other type of headphone that might offer some measure of sound isolation -lrb- the Grados famously have a `` open '' design , so in term of isolation , listen to they be akin to have a boombox tape to you head -rrb- . to this end , I try various in-ear headphone and some closed over-ear one . long story short , nothing in the -lrb- $ 200 range come even close to sound as fun as my sr60i . the only logical place to go be higher on the Grado spectrum , and so I try the sr80i . since I be not a audiophile , I 'll try to do my best to describe they sound in mostly imprecise term . First of all , both the sr60us and the sr80us be literally revelatory - they show up new detail in familiar recording that the speaker and earbud I be use before I find the Grados be too stodgy to handle . they render all part of the frequency spectrum with aplomb . the deep subbass on Shackleton 's fabric 55 recording sound incredibly tight and controlled . Electric guitar , which reside mostly in the midrange , sound particularly embody , with a fully realize attack , something I sorely miss in more expensive headphone like the monster turbine . the cymbal on Miles Davis ' ` bitch brew ' be smooth , not harsh . most importantly , these headphone be just fun to listen to . they bring everything , even album I have grow tired of , alive . and they do this consistently , perhaps because Grado 's emphasis seem to be on musicality and not just by-the-numbers fidelity . there be two definite minus , both of which be flip side to the same design decision that give rise to they amazing sound , namely the fact that they be open -lrb- the earpiece chamber have large grilled vent -rrb- . forget about listen to these on plane , since they do not block any outside sound . also , they basically broadcast what you be listen to , and hence be unsuitable for office or library . many have complain that they be uncomfortable - my girlfriend find that the earpad hurt she ear after a hour of listen - but I find they eminently comfortable and can wear they indefinitely without problem , so that may be a matter of individual head shape or ear size . be the sr80us worth the $ 20 premium over the sr60us ? they look identical in all respects and appear to have the same specification and outward construction , so it come down to the sound . my sr80us be tighter , more controlled and at the same time , deeper , when it come to bass reproduction in comparison to my sr60us . Make no mistake , the sr60us be no slouch and never allow the bass to boom and overwhelm other part of the spectrum , but it just feel slightly looser and more elastic . the difference be subtle , but definite , and over long period of listen , I believe the sr80us will justify the extra expense . lastly , I should reiterate one negative that many people have mention . if you be not one of those people who tend to buy expensive audio equipment , get a pair of these might , by open you up to a world of gorgeous sound , lead to a rather expensive hobby .
Headphone	NEG	1	when you turn on the noise cancel feature you can hear a very low rumble sound . I try these on a airplane and several other white noise environment , like fan blow . when compare these to regular headphone , there be no difference at all . a coworker let I try he bose noise cancel headset and that do make a noticeable difference . the noise cancel feature of these philip headphone appear to be worthless . the comfort and quality of these as just regular headphone be ok , but why would you buy these unless you want the noise cancel feature ?
Headphone	POS	5	I have a pair of these after my Sennheiser 's from college die finally -lrb- and I graduate in 1988 -rrb- . now I need another pair because my new dog eat MY FIRST PAIR !! the best thing about these , besides the fact that they be comfortable and the sound be great be the 6 meter cord with its own volume control that you can clip to you -lrb- that about 18 foot , so I can be across the room from a tv instead of 4 foot away like most headphone -rrb- . yes , thank you , I have try wireless . much more expensive and I be cheap and do not mind the cord . these rock . buy a pair , now . no , really , I mean it . make it 2 if you have a dog that like to eat cord ...
Headphone	POS	4	I order this pair of headphone for my Motorola Triumph smartphone . so far I do not have real complaint . under normal noise level the ambient noise be greatly isolate and I can hear music or person in the phone w\/o any problem . people tell I I sound a little muffle but they can understand I w\/o and problem . in noisy situation -lrb- I have worn these while mow the lawn as well as while ride my motorcycle -rrb- I still get ambient noise come through - but I can still hear the music very well . I do not play my music very loud ... usually only at around 50 % and I wear a 1\/2 helmet so I know that there be a lot of noise when I be ride . I have not have to take any call while on the bike so I be not too sure how well they will perform in that situation . the in-the-ear bud be comfortable and they stay in my ear even when I be very active . the headset come with several different tip for I to select the right size for I .
Headphone	POS	4	cant beat this . overall good headphone for the money . sound quality be ok and isolation from the outside world be ok as well . everyone can hear only if turn up on the loud side but over all this be a good product .
Headphone	NEG	1	the sound quality of these headphone be relatively poor but that be not why I return they . the range be about 25 foot on the same floor and then loud static would come and go at different location in the house . this be very consistent . in the basement they be useless . I replace they with a set by rca model wph150 for $ 30 less and the sound be much better and no problem anywhere in the house .
Headphone	POS	5	great sound , comfortable though they pinch my ear a bit after more than a hour .
Headphone	POS	4	I really like sennheiser because they sell quality product at reasonable price . these headphone be no exception . I get it at $ 21 , which be a steal . the sound quality be almost as good as a $ 70 pair of headphone I be use before . when compare these to bose QuietComfort 15 acoustic , the bose be noticeably better . but , I pay $ 21 vs. $ 300 it cost for the bose . my only complaint be that these headphone have the bass frequency slightly increase . I be from the old-school and do not believe in use a equalizer or change the frequency . regardless , these headphone be great . and to truly enjoy they , use they to listen to you favorite cd -lrb- mp3 will do these headphone no justice -rrb- .
Headphone	NEU	3	the headphone perform the task , sound quality be not as good as a wire connection would be
Headphone	NEG	1	I just send these back and order the 170 . there be way too much hissing . it be extremely annoying . I try switch channel a million time , move the base , etc. . occasionally it would work and I would have great sound for a minute , but then come the hissing . I really hope the 2.4 ghz of the 170s do not have this problem .
Headphone	POS	5	the headphone have perfect overall sound quality . I really like the deep bass I be get . the headphone block most of the noise outside and actually stay on my ear . in all these aspect , it be better than any pair of in-the-ear headphone I have use in the past . this be much better than I hope . at this price I would say this be a perfect deal .
Headphone	POS	5	I have buy many of this headphone already they be pretty gud what suck be that the black one be cheaper than the white one and they be both the same . I think both should cause the same
Headphone	POS	4	these headphone and other -lrb- in some different color , and design -rrb- can be find at you local dollar store . that a savings of 88 cent . so get and up go there !
Headphone	POS	5	this be the first wireless headphone i even have . it work great and the sound quality be good . the price be reasonable too . recommend this wireless headphone for anyone who be look for budget wireless with good quality .
Headphone	NEU	3	for the price I buy the headphone for they be acceptable and work well enough . the biggest problem I have have so far be that for some reason the signal seem to be interfere with my wireless internet . my internet connection do not work within the range of the docking station for the headphone , and as soon as I turn off the unit my internet connection be fine again . I mostly watch movie and tv show through the internet , so this be a problem for I . otherwise they work fine and be comfortable enough . if you do not need to use the internet while you be use the headphone then they be a good price for what you get . and it be nice to be able to charge the headphone instead of have to put in new battery .
Headphone	POS	5	for about $ 10 , these be a bargain !! I buy the blue version of these on Amazon for the purpose of act as a backup pair of headphone for my $ 40  Skullcandy TiTAN 's -lrb- black -rrb-  I get they because they be recommend from Consumer Reports , and I be impressed . the sound quality rival that of my top-notch TiTAN 's , and they fit much better in my ear than the TiTAN 's . my friend say they be much more durable than the other $ 10 headphone she be have in the past ; very sturdy for the price . the only thing I and she be concern about be how the silicone bud be slightly flimsy , but , then again , these be only $ 10 . but for $ 10 , you could not find a better pair of headphone . UPDATE : I have go through 2 pair of these thing since I first buy they . I wash my 1st pair , & go awhile without another pair like this . when I order my second pair , I realize again what I have be miss . the bass be not as full as my  sennheiser cx300 ii  the treble be richer , however . and these thing can stand a lot of abuse . as long as the beating be not abnormal , the only real reason you would buy another pair be because you lose they .
Headphone	POS	4	they be ship and receive when promise . the sound be very good . the only negative be the cost to send they to I -lrb- postage be way out of line -rrb-
Headphone	NEG	2	these be not adjustable in any way . the speaker part be so huge and the hook be too big to fit snugly over my ear to keep they in place . after about 20 minute I be have to take they off they hurt so bad . I would return they if I could ! love the Nike Vapor white plastic one . very adjustable and lightweight .
Headphone	POS	4	Orderd headphone 20 $ arrived in 4 day free shipping over 25 $ . read alot of review and figure what the hey and be right , I have a large head 7 3\/4 I think and a full bushy head of hair and when I see headphone I think no way r these thing go to fit . if you pull down hard on each ear pad they extend to a very large size and fit very nice , iam 1 notch from the largest setting and think they would fit a 8 size head . the sound be ok because the bass be a little to strong on classic rock but if u use a equalizer u can work around this problem . the 10 foot cord be great and the noise canceling be not really good . work on a computer u can here tv and phone ringing and other people can here what u r listen to but it be a low volume . they be so comfortable and do not squish my ear because my ear fit perfctly inside the pad . im wonder if all the other comment of major pressure on head and not fitting at all , if they realize u can extend the earpad to a very large head ? all in all worth the 20 $ 4\/5
Headphone	POS	5	description of product as state . I have walk around my house with the headphone on and have have perfect reception to listen to my favorite movie or music . excellent product !
Headphone	POS	5	i get these for 15 buck and i wont go back its awesome although sort of cheap and break easily its alright though because you have a warranty
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be my workhorse headphone . they be open , which mean I do not miss the dinner bell or the phone ringing . they sound great , be very light , and , to shock some people , be rather comfortable . yes , I say it , these headphone be comfortable ! this be my first Grado purchase , and I enjoy they so much I have to try the rs2us 's and I end up get they too ! sound : 4.5 \/ 5 Grado headphone be know to favor the midrange and be fast respond headphone . definitely true . Bass be there , but compare to the mid and high , its the most lack . I do not find this a major distraction , as I do not crave massive bass , and I have a portable amp that can boost bass if absolutely necessary when a basshead want to try it out and complain about lack of bass . if you enjoy rock and do not need eardrum-rattling bass , give these a try ! comfort : 5\/5 call I crazy , but these be the most comfortable headphone I have . most people complain about the ear pad and the headband , but I find the headband to be just fine , and the ear pad give more cushion than my rs2us 's , at a slight tradeoff of muffle sound a tiny bit -lrb- not too drastic , after use the headphone for 80 + hour you do not really notice it anymore -rrb- . I do not mod my headphone , but if you be willing to , these will become even more comfortable to you , and at the price-point of these headphone , it be still quite affordable for those in the know about higher quality headphone . value : 5\/5 they might not be the greatest overall sound headphone at they price-point , and some may complain about they comfort , but I find this a great deal . it be in the middle of it be class , one that span from $ 80 to $ 300 , this be around $ 150 . some people start to listen to Grado and wonder how the higher end headphone sound , so start off with something like the sr80us to sr225us and if you get curious you can still afford to step up to a wooden Grado set , which Grado aficionado state you need for a true Grado headphone sound .
Headphone	POS	4	I be attract by these earphone for a couple reason . First of all I break my Sony earbud , I lose my apple earphone , and I do not like carry around my bose on-ear headphone . pro - fit comfortably sound decent -lrb- equal to any apple earphone , or my previous Sony in-ear -rrb- do its job con - have slight hissing noise , but I have always have a good sense of hearing , so might just be I have a bump on the outer ear part 3.5 mm jack from earbud be slightly large , well approx . 1.5 inch all in all . it be a decent product . I would not recommend this to anyone because I prefer actual headphone oppose to earphone , but if you be on the go , it be a decent product . experience : 1.5 week
Headphone	POS	5	cheap and just as good as bose qc ! well worth the price !!! Have have no problem with remanufactured goods from amazon !
Headphone	POS	5	I really like these headphone , they fit in my ear perfectly . I just buy my second pair of they because the first one do break after a year but for the price it be well worth it . the sound quality be great and you can get like 10 for the price of some of the expensive headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	I just get these on sale for $ 24 . I be a little discourage to hear people write that they hurt they ear because I always seem to have that problem with headphone . I be big -lrb- 6 ' 7 '' -rrb- and I do not have small ear , but for $ 24 I figure what the heck . I be glad I ignore those review because I do not have any problem . I have have mine on now for the last 3 hour with no problem . the sound be quality be great and so be the bass response . there be a few hip hop song I have listen to and be completely suprise by they ability to hit some of the low frequency . best pair of headphone I have ever own in the -lrb- $ 60 range .
Headphone	NEG	2	I would have send this back but I need to do some more copying . it be a piece of junk as far as I be concern . a piece of plastic junk hope it last until I be do need it . also the door do not stay closed and once you send the record to I tune that be it it be do . just like everything else these day poorly make and way overprice .
Headphone	POS	5	the signal strength be superior , very comfortable on ear . battery long for the hour and charge station keep the headset charge every time . this be my second set . right now I can use both headset connect to one of the station . I would buy this product again in the future .
Headphone	POS	5	ok ... so here go another comparison between the Koss Portpros and the sennheiser 100 's ? I be not go to bear you . . both headphone be outstanding performer with a ipod ... I own they both ... so which one be my preference ? the sennheiser , for one reason only ... people use they ipod in mall and on the go . there be time when I want to remove the phone from my ear for a few moment -lrb- say , in a store or when have conversation -rrb- . with the Sennheisers , I can remove the phone from my ear and let they `` hang '' around my neck in comfort ... try this with the Koss 's and they will place a stranglehold on you . for this reason alone , I recommend the Senn 's . both , in my humble opinion , sound equally good .
Headphone	NEU	3	short version be that this be a nice mp3 player . expansion slot for sd , solid construction -lrb- battery cover be a bit flimsy though -rrb- battery life be long . etc. etc. . biggest drawback that negate all of the above be that they drm cripple the little thing . it be so nice up until you find out you have to use TDK 's proprietory UniFi software . which unify nothing . it `` allow '' you to copy mp3 from you system to it . and then they be dead . you can not copy they back , you can not transfer they to anything else . and here be the best part , Windows do not recognize the device unless you install the software . it be all the software as well , if you merely remove the sd card you can move and copy mp3 to it via a reader and the mojo play they fine . but obviously this do not work for the main flash memory . and you need the software to make it work ... so unless someone reverse engineer the program , do not buy this .
Headphone	POS	4	I buy this in a combo with the Razer Orcas . I be plan to clip it onto the wire of my Orcas but the clip be too big . Wish you could change that . other than that , this mic pick up everything . good or bad ? depend . as I say earlier , great for what you pay for and I do not think you would use this for record music or anything . I use it for communicate over Skype for gaming or just talk to friend .
Headphone	NEG	1	unfortunately the headphone have already stop work . one of the earbud go out completely about 1wk after receive they . the only other problem be that I be assume because of low cost price I do not feel that it be worth with to return it .
Headphone	NEG	1	these be just aweful . after about 4 mo , they will not hold onto you head . if you look down while wear they , they will hit the floor . also , if you audio signal go quiet for more than about 30 seconds , you hear a little `` click '' then deafening static hiss . be very dissapointed .
Headphone	POS	4	I have a pair of the old l-jack one that last I several year . they break , tragically , with I put they in a bag that get crush . I replace they with a pair of the straight jack style and they do not last 8 month before the right channel all but stop work . but I be go to get another pair because : they isolate sound - really - well : it could be dangerous if you be walk or etc. . the sound be good : most earbud be too treble-y but these be well-balanced they be comfortable : I do not care for cold metal bit in my ear . and the foam be more comfortable than silicone . they be cheap they be not hideous or flashy only downside be that they 'll break pretty easily if crushed and they be cheaply make -lrb- but they be cheap , so that be to be expect -rrb- .
Headphone	NEU	3	you get what you pay for . the quality of the sound seem fine , but I can not get they loud enough to really test they . I buy these for my 2 small child , so that they could listen to they dvd on car trip . they seem to like they ok , although the bud be a little big . but when I try to listen to music with they , I could barely hear .
Headphone	NEG	1	the headphone stop work after my 3rd or 4th run . I shorten the wire and use only the top half . I find that I really like the short cord and do not worry about the broken bottom half of the cord . I suffer a personal set back and be not able to exercise or use the headphone for several month . I recently start use the headphone again and after another 4 run , they be indeed break . I try they on other music player and still get nothing . I contact the seller and they say I be out of the 3 month warrenty . I be hope they could\/would be willing to fix or exchange my headphone . -lrb- not really one to spend this much money on headphone -rrb- . they do not even entertain any notion of compensation . how come the consumer can not have a policy ? my policy be a set of headphone should last longer than 10 use or 6 month . I live in a dream world I guess .
Headphone	NEU	3	I be sorry to say that the general comment about these headphone appear to be true . I be after some circum-aural , close back , reasonably price and reasonably balanced headphone and these tick all the box . the sound be great , the cable be long enough for my need , it come with a pouch to store they in when you be not wear they and they look pretty great too . the major flaw with this product be that these headphone be so tight that they soon become unbearable to wear . the band be very small and tightly spring and by the time half hour have pass and I have have these press against the side of my head I have a headache and feel slightly nauseous . not ideal condition to say the least . I wear glass and have the arm of they press against my skull be unbearable , but even when I try these with my glass off it be still too uncomfortable . I even try a few day with these stretch over a box whenever I be not wear they and whilst this help very slightly , it be never comfortable enough to wear these to enjoy my music . the packaging , as other have note be atrocious as well , it be a mission to get into these and you need a sharp knife and much care so as not to damage the headphone as you open they . I be disappoint with these , as apart from the one major flaw these be exactly what I be after and after considerable time research different type of headphone for my requirement these fall short of the mark in the comfort stake . I send mine back for a refund , but I would still suggest they be worth a try as the other feature be so good , just be aware they may be too tight for you . Feel free to check out my blog which can be find on my profile page .
Headphone	POS	4	overall , the quality of these earbud be very good . they seem very sturdy and the build quality be great . the bud themselves look rather plain to I , but the remote look pretty good . the issue of a noisy cord be something that will happen to most earbud out there , so nothing unexpected there . -lrb- use the clip help a lot . -rrb- the 45 degree angle of the plug be a nice feature and the remote work well with my ipod touch 4g . the package I get come with ear-hook that seem to work well , a nice v-moda brand pouch , and a four different size of tip that should work for most people out there . the earbud fit my rather large ear canal snugly and overall be comfortable . in term of the sound quality , these will definitely beat the quality of the basic white ipod earbud as well as most basic earbud . the bass be heavy , and boom . personally , I feel it overwhelm , but some people prefer that . -lrb- I 'll definitely be use these while listen to some dubstep though ; -rrb- . -rrb- however , -lrb- it could be the powerful bass , but -rrb- I feel as if the treble be only alright . the high just be not as clear as they could be and seem a bit muddle to I . I be compare these to the first generation of  lady Gaga Heartbeats In-Ear Headphones -lrb- Rose Red -rrb-  -lrb- the remix do beat the Heartbeats in overall bass power , but , again , I personally prefer the bass not to overwhelm too much . -rrb- to summarize , pro - great build quality and durability - remote work nicely -45 degree plug be nice - Bass be powerful con - Treble be only average
Headphone	POS	5	i love this little guy for one its hellum cheaper then at like guitar center or radio shack and it work great i can now record myself on my computer with this so im happy
Headphone	NEU	3	these sound pretty good for $ 15 dollar headphone but beware of one thing ... the power output of you device and here 's why . to make decent sound headphone at a lower cost , they must sacrifice the magnet quality . when you have a less efficient magnet , it require more power from the device to move the magnet , and thus the speaker driver . these sound ok with my creative zen and I could not seem to get the sound loud enough to drown out outside noise . then I try my studio , higher quality headphone with be 3x the size with a 50mm driver and it be significantly louder with the same device , which it could only do because of the magnet quality . I try they with a ipod , and because they have a high power output , I could get the volume I need from these , but it may be different for any non ipod device . so if you be use these with a ipod , do not fret and go for it , they sound great , especially at this price . however , beware that they may not potentially meet you need if it be not a ipod or smaller device .
Headphone	POS	5	sound quality be amazing . noise reduction be pretty good too , can not hear anything once I have these bad boy on .
Headphone	NEG	1	yay ! I get it ! I plug it in , turn it on and crystal clear I can hear my neighebor on the left hand side talk about he will with he attorney on one channel , and my neighbor on the right hand side orderede capri in khaki on the other channel . Perfect ... except I want to hear my music . I think it be in the next channel but can not tell for sure under all that static . 1 star for get my neighbor chordless phone , that may come in useful to someone sometime . the headphone be comfortable and light . battery be contain within the headphone , so you have to replace battery every so often . static be huge issue , I can barely hear what I be suppose to hear and I be stand right over the base . the base also very light , do not even feel substantial enough to transmit anything .
Headphone	POS	5	I would say that these be a great value for the price . I like a lot of bass , but there be not a overwhelming amount of bass . the treble be crisp and cymbal be not pingy , they be crisp and precise . for the price of $ 14.99 , these earphone be a incredible value . the treble be crisp , the bass be great . and consider I have a 200 watt infinity sub on my home system , I know good bass when I hear it . these earphone be comfortable and sound great . I use they everyday at school with my portable cd player , and let I say I be extremely satisfy with they . consider I purchase these to replace a pair of $ 75 Sony Earphones , and I be more satisfied with these , I be extremely impressed . the only reason I can think of why somebody would give these a bad review , be if they purchase a pair of Sennheiser pro series which run minimum $ 150 a pair . these earphone have the best quality for the money ! do not pass these up !
Headphone	POS	5	ive have these for a couple day and there sick , im very big on my music . there great for all type of music just adjust the eq level , worth every cent , i love v moda im never onna change brand .
Headphone	POS	5	headphone be great , they be comfortable and come with three different ear bud size . sound quality be also great . Bang for the buck .
Headphone	POS	5	my experience with noise reduce earphone be with the JVC hanc100 , which be a earlier , and fairly satisfactory headphone . I have be satisfy with it for about a year . this , the JVC hanc80 noise cancel headphone , be even better ! the sound rendition be superb . and this model have two mode of noise reduction : low frequency , and a wider range for more typical noisy environment , e.g. office , library , shopping , home -lrb- when relative visit -rrb- , auto travel , bus , aircraft , well , you get the picture ... I like the wide range . at home with airconditioner , fan , neigborhood sound , jet above , radio blare , dog bark etc , the effect be comforting . add some music from you ipod or radio earphone outlet and you find yourself in a -lrb- quiet -rrb- heaven , listen to a high quality of sound reproduction . I be impress with the sound quality , and I have use earphone of various type for many year . one must understand that these , or any , noise-reduction earphone be exactly that : they be not noise-cancelling ! silicone earplug be the best you can do in that regard . best noise reduction be in the very low frequency -lrb- make my Boston MBTA subway excursion bearable -rrb- . the excellent sound quality be icing on the cake . get real ! this be not star Trek , merely the 21st century . you do not need to spend $ 350 for that high price brand ! this be a excellent product . recommend . also look at the JVC harx300 non-noisecancelling phone . they go over the ear , be very reasonably price , have fantastic sound . not design to be easily transport -lrb- do not fold -rrb- . I love they - have three , in each place in my home where I like to listen to music or tv .  JVC Full-Size Headphones -lrb- Black -rrb-
Headphone	POS	5	the blue band be a nice silicone material . these be super lightweight , too ! if you have a tendency to nap with headphone , turn you head such that you ear rest on a pillow be not painful like most `` can '' , but almost unnoticeable . the 15 -25 khz response , and inline volume slider re great attribute .
Headphone	NEU	3	these headphone have be pretty good for I for a little over a year . they have give I a sore head after extended use , but nothing too severe . my main issue here come with the retractable headphone cord go bad , and just outside the one-year warranty , to boot . I have be the only one use they , and not in any way that should harm they . the left ear have begin to stop work , and I have to twist the cord around to get any sound in it at all . all in all , good headphone for a little over a year , but watch out for the headphone cord give out .
Headphone	POS	5	I have own the Bose Quietcomfort 15 and currently own the monster beat Studio , and these sound very similar to the Beats ONLY if you fiddle around with the eq . since I own a Sony walkman , it have a customize eq which be very great . I adjust to sound almost as the Beats , but the only thing that the Beats overcome with these kicker headphone be its stronger bass . not say the kicker have no bass , it have alot for $ 45 compare to $ 300 . overall , I recommend these , light on you head , comfortable , and sound be clear .
Headphone	POS	5	I be look for headphone that would stay put while I be run and after a lot of research I find these . I love they as soon as I put they in -- I have smaller ear so the various size be ideal . they absolutely stay put when I go run , no matter how much I sweat . I put they in and do not have to think about my headphone again until I take they out .
Headphone	NEU	3	pricey for the slight improvement in sound quality and the case be barely enough to provide a tiny extra bit of protection for you headphone . however , I get it for a cheap price from one of the third-party seller on amazon , and it feel comfortable in my ear as compare to the regular earphone .
Headphone	NEG	2	too uncomfortable and hard to hear if there be any outside noise . it would be better if they be smaller and would fit nice and snug inside my ear .
Headphone	POS	5	my husband have be use these at work , five day per week , for just under two year now . he love they . they work well and do not hurt you head or ear after wear they for a while .
Headphone	POS	4	overall a amazing deal . for the cost the sound quality be absolutely amazing , crisp , clear , but lack the bass you would get with more expensive and larger con headphone . the only downfall to these be the design and comfort , which at they worse be not really that bad . the headband catch on you hair all the time and be not convenient to take on and off because the adjustability be not very convenient . the other adjustability problem be the `` comfort zone '' adjuster to make the earphone tighter or looser on you head , very inconvenient . but overall you can not beat the quality for the price . if you want the best headphone for under $ 50 , you find they with these , although they have a few imperfection , the value to quality ratio be unbeatable . great value !
Headphone	POS	4	the SENNHEISER PMX SPORT be ABSOLUTLEY great for all use , indoors and out . very comfortable to wear and great sound . DO NOT HINDER in ANY WAY a activity .
Headphone	POS	4	the first thing I notice about these headphone be the comfort -- the material be very soft and fit just around my ear -lrb- though it may not work for other , as I have very small ear -rrb- . the headband , stuff with a little cotton , fit especially well over my head , and do not beat down on the top as some other plastic one have . after I put they on , I notice that I could hear EVERYTHING ... which might be good or bad , depend on its use . it be good for closed performance -lrb- without a audience -rrb- because every tiny nuance provide by the performer be present crystal-clear . in fact , at certain very , very quiet pause , I even could hear the orchestra turn the page -lrb- literally -rrb- ! however , it be not so good for live performance , where every obnoxious \* cough , cough \* or \* HACKGH , HACKGH \* from the audience can be hear , equally crystal-clear . another trait of these headphone be that , when I let other try they , the headphone do not leak . that be , I can not hear what they be listen to unless I jam my ear against theirs , and they certainly can not hear I . this `` containment '' of the sound be probably the reason why the music sound much louder through these than through the other I have try . overall , I think these headphone be worth the price . however , they do not leak as much sound as the Panasonic noise-canceling headphone , and they be especially comfortable and extremely , I repeat extremely clear .
Headphone	NEG	2	these be not very good . I do not like how they fall of my ear so easily . I have to keep push they back in and the sound quality be comprimise .
Headphone	POS	5	I reccommend they to all who want a nice pair of headphone at a great price , I own three pair of they for different member of my family . my twelve year old daughter love they . great quality and sound .
Headphone	POS	5	they sound great , ear clip actually work , one of the best pair of headphone that I have ever buy for less than $ 20
Headphone	POS	5	I have be go through several pair of open , on-ear full-size headphone but I need to get earbud that block noise and do not leak like crazy -lrb- like my open one do -rrb- anyways , I be a bit skeptical when I order these -lrb- after read comparison on head-fi forum -rrb- but I have be nothing short of impressed . here be one tip - if you get in-ear earbud make sure they come with different size earpiece . these headphone do . this be extremely important !!! if they do not , plan to buy some separately . everyone 's ear be different in size so make sure the earpiece fit right . sound = 4\/5 Bass = 4\/5 Noise cancelling = superb for this price point -lrb- mine be sixteen -rrb- you can not find something that be this sturdy and with this sound quality . they be awesome ! earbud MAY induce massive WAX ATTACKS : also , if you not use to wear in-ear earbud - be aware - because the earbud be a `` foreign object , '' you ear canal might -lrb- like mine do -rrb- produce ear wax to combat it . yuk ! I clean my ear before and after i use these guy . bottom line : get these headphone - they be affordable sturdy sound great ample bass isolate well come with different size earpiece well design - leave be shorter than the right , which wrap around behind you head also - you can lie down with they in you ear because they do not stick out like other do
Headphone	POS	4	we get these for several multi-user workstation . they be adequate for the price . we want something with plastic\/leather ear pad that can be wipe down between user , and these provide that for we . these be best for industrial , public , multi-user situation where the listener will not be need they for very long . as other have mention , they be not very comfortable , so you do not want to wear they for more than 30 minute at time -lrb- or less , for those who have large head -rrb- . the sound be also adequate for the above state purpose . these be by no means mean to be use to pick out the 3rd chair violin during a very quiet movement of Bach .
Headphone	POS	5	Great for the money . they sound decent for non ear bud phone on a mp3 player but backgrond sound be not as efficintly block . but if you like I and can not use ear bud this be a great alternative
Headphone	POS	5	this product be another great buy for I and for a cheap price that I have save a x amount of dollar .
Headphone	POS	5	I enjoy listen to hi-fi audio through headphone . my setup be laptop use JetAudio -- -rrb- Predator DAC\/AMP -- -rrb- d5000 . the can be great ! superb detail and honest to music reproduction w that wow factor . Bass seem heavy but I like it . I be burn they in now . I own d2000 and audio-technica 990-ti 's and each have they home but I listen mostly to the d5000 's now .
Headphone	POS	5	awesome product , I have use bose , Sony and Pioneer and the sein be way better , and for the money be awesome and conformable . my wife put aside she bose and now I have to buy she a set . I listen to rock and they handle the bass very very well , even with hip hop and techno and the bass bounce back fast , I do not know the term for it , but it handle fast bass throw at it like from Meatallica and such ... so if you like rock or metal , these be good to go ... even for classical and club , I try all music so far . well not polka or swing , but I be sure it 'll work ... Hope this help , , shoot shoooot .
Headphone	POS	5	love these headphone . they last a very long time as compare with other headphone I have use . they be very comfortable and stay put even during very jarring activity such as run . they be also water\/sweat resistant . I have fry out many other headphone because of this and these be the only one that stay in my smallish ear without constant fiddling . Worth pay a little more for , but they be on the higher side for headphone . price have come down a bit due to a newer version out .
Headphone	NEG	1	Techinically sprake the sound quality of this headphone be good , but my headphone do not work after few day normal usage
Headphone	NEG	2	I can not say enough bad thing about these if you be go to use they for run . they be make to go on you arm , so one cord be longer than the other . they have a connector half way down that come with a extender enable they to be longer and attach to to you waist , but this make the cord heavy thus pull they out of you ear . because the cord be rubber they also bounce a lot when run . I give they two star since they do come with multiple size piece that fit nicely into you ear . if you be go to sit still when use they they be great . if you be plan on use they actively keep look .
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be wonderful . they be the best pair of headphone I have ever own . I consider myself a audiophile . I have no electronic background but have purchase many high-end piece of audio equipment over the past 30 year . I currently own several headphone include the ah-d2000 -lrb- I purchase these for my daughter -rrb- and the Ultimate Ears triple . fi10 earbud to use when I travel . I be sure I would love the ah-d7000 but I feel the $ 600 difference be probably not justifiable . I be able to purchase these for $ 399 . there be a small , but noticeable , sound quality difference between the 2000 and 5000 headphone that I feel the less than $ 200 difference between they be worth it . Bass be deeper without distortion . Treble note be crisper . midrange be fuller . although I can listen to classical music , my preference be classic rock . Pink Floyd dark side of the Moon and The Wall sound fantastic . Led Zeppelin be amazing . for those that have comment that these headphone need a external amp to drive they , I disagree . although the majority of the time I listen to they use my Pioneer Elite receiver and they sound great , I plug they into my ipod and they sound very good . the quality of the music be not as full , rich , and `` powerful '' sound but more than I expect , especially give the review I read . I do not know if I would opt for the 5000 over the 2000 if the price differential be over $ 300 -lrb- I have see they from $ 399 to $ 699 -rrb- ; but , I feel it be a bargain at the $ 140 difference when I buy they .
Headphone	NEU	3	well ... I get the item and it be NEW . on here I think it be state that the charger and what not be not include . BUT IT WAS !!! it be NEW in the box with everything and factory seal . well ... I have only listen to they a couple of time so far . they sound good and work good ! I will admit that and do not get I wrong . and I have even use they with my Iphone dock to my Sony stereo , which by the way be another half useless item , that I have beef with other than docking my phone and listen to Slacker stereo on it from my subscription . the headphone work through the wall and onto outside with the door close . I have even go to my car with they on and it be not right outside my front door . after a certain point , it be intermittent sound , but that be expect - look how far I go ! I be not expect ANY SOUND where I go . but I get some , and as I come back and get closer again to my apartment , it come in clear as a whistle ! but hey ! I be in a apartment complex . but these be the reason I be give this 3 star instead of 4 or 5 though . they be really bulky to wear . and when I see they on the website , I look at the ear cushion . I think they be some type of leather , or a rubber type of material like other company 's headwear . the description do not talk about the cushion . well ... when I see what the ear cushion be when I open the box , I be kind of mad for that kind of money , that they would put this soft material like ear cushion . and it also specifically state in the instruction that you should change these cushion OFTEN . that mean you gotta come out of you pocket over and over to keep on BUYING ear cushion for this thing , like you be rich or something . and I be sure it aint CHEAP either , cos these AINT CHEAP HEADSETS ! that be if you can find they somewhere . I have not look yet though . but I clearly be not happy about that at all and I sincerely think about send they back at first . but I keep they , because it be a good buy , compare to other place that sell they . I look before I buy them ... and after I buy them . that be the ONLY REASON why I keep THESE HEADSETS , because I see what the actual price be go for and it be WAY more than what I pay on Amazon at the time . and I do mean WAY more !!!! but for now , they be just sit there collect dust . so ... whenever when !
Headphone	POS	5	the headset be buy for my slightly deaf father . he live in a nursing home and have a roommate . I choose the rs-140 because it have the `` closed can '' to shut out the -lrb- also hear impaired -rrb- roommate 's tv etc while allow my father to hear he tv . the setup work great . the separate volume for each earphone allow perfect balance to compensate for differential hearing ability in each ear . if you want to be able to hear the room as well as the music go with the rs-130 to get the `` open can '' . I use the headset during the setup and find no fault with the sound quality or reproduction and there do not appear to be any interferance from other electronic device . he sometimes wear the headset `` down the hall '' and the quality do not begin to degrade -lrb- through concrete block wall in a steel frame building full of medical equipment -rrb- for about 80 foot -- in open air I be sure it would be double that . the headset be comfortable and the charge arrangement be transparent to the user . my father find the charge stand `` a little tippy '' because he have to reach the headset with a grabber from a wheelchair across a bed . mount the charge base fix that . a person use they hand would not have this problem at all .
Headphone	POS	4	I buy these headphone as a gift for my mother so she could listen to the tv with out turn up the volume at night . they fit a little snug on my head but I think they be wear in a little so it be not too bad . if you have a smaller head they fit just fine like my mother . they do not have ear cup like regular headphone but they do sit on top of you ear and conform somewhat . it just take a little while to get use to the feeling . they feel like they will fall off at time but they be snug . the sound be pretty good for FM reception . you can walk like 50 to 100 foot away and still pick up the signal indoors . the box say 300 foot outdoors but I do not try it . I be sure they go close to it . the headphone have a tuning button on they to tune into the channel you want . all so the transmitter have 3 channel setting so you can find one that work best for you . it be not hard to tune in just keep turn the knob till you get a good signal on the headphone . sometimes you can pickup up CB radio and phone call if they be close by but only if you un tune the headphone from the transmitter till you hear static . it be kind of funny to hear people talk on the phone and the cb but it be only when you un tune the headphone otherwise it be not a problem at all . the sound be clear . put the headphone on the charger be easy too they just slide right into place and line up with the metal bar in the headphone . you may have to shorten the headphone when you put they back on the charger because the instruction say not to hold open the headphone or put they on a glass dummy head because they can lose there snug fit over time . it be not a problem if you remember to do this . you can also hang the charger on the wall . it have a hole in back for a nail or some other hook to hang it up with . the cord for the power and sound connector be long too about 5 to six foot more or less so you should have no problem place the transmitter anywhere to get better reception . it can hook up to a radio with the include adapter or hook up to a mp3 player or what ever take that kind of plug . the charger cradle be sturdy and have rubber foot on it so it do not tip over or move when you place the headphone back on to charge . the box they come in be easy to open and be well pack with 2 set of air bag . over all I like they and recommend they to any one .
Headphone	POS	5	this headphone be great , this be my first headphone and be great , good sound quality , perfect noise reduction , the only bad thing be that they will get a little hot on you ear but after use it for 2 straight hour ... so I guess this be a must if you want good headphone .
Headphone	POS	4	these be just excellent for the price . Bass : not too much bass or not to little bass , Bass be deep and rich . seem to be very balanced , never Muddy at all very strong @ 100 + hz . lose some bass strength under 40hz . if you a bass head just plug in you Headphone Amp and use a eq and trust I , the bass will vibrate you ear with these headphone and they still sound fairly clean but can be muddy . stock without any equalization the bass be balanced and fine . high : high sometimes get distorted or sound too harsh -lrb- Pretty Rare but be noticeable on some song -rrb- . you can hear little crackling sound and it just make I wa not to take they off or change the song , otherwise high be just fine Mids : balanced and lot of definition , just like the bass , not to little or too much . Comfort\/Built Quality : after wear they for a while you will get use to they and they will seem lighter and you can wear they for a longer amount of time without they hurt you ear . I can listen to these for about 2 hour straight before i have to take they off because my ear hurt . pad be comfortable and the stuffing be nice and soft . build Quality be ok , some part of the headphone feel really cheap like the plastic thingie that allow the headphone to turn . all the other material on the headphone feel pretty high end .
Headphone	POS	4	I first try a pair of Shure E1C earbud and hate they ; I think they make everything sound tinny . then I try the Sony and think exactly the same thing , and could not figure out why I get better sound out of the $ 10 pair of earbud I buy at the Sony Outlet . after a couple of subway and airplane ride , I finally figure out the whole thing : - fit be everything with deep-insertion ear instrument . earbud , hear protection , whatever . fit be everything . once I finally get they seat correctly , they isolate outside noise very well and sound clear , keep in mind that I be not expect the same visceral reaction to earbud that I have to my over-the-ear akg phone . - use CD quality source material for you first listen . I think it be the bud -lrb- both Shure and Sony -rrb- that be make my source sound tinny , and then I rip a cd of 128k mp3 and decide that I hate what the compression do to the music . I simply fail to pay attention before I start use a portable device . not to plug , but WMA format cure a lot of the compression problem to I . -lrb- Apple format also sound good on my friend 's ipod . -rrb- - would have like a inline volume control . I know that eat into fidelity , but whatever ; make a control with gold plate contact already . - the whole cord extension thing be a disaster . too short with , too long without . do not even get I start on the `` case . '' mostly , I like these earbud ; Sony certainly have other `` high resolution '' earbud but if you can get these around $ 30 , it be a decent choice .
Headphone	POS	5	product be Great . Service be great . keep up the good work !
Headphone	POS	5	before purchase this product , I have be read about people recommend the Sennheiser hd555 's and whatnot and it concern I if the ad700 's be really the better deal . what I really want be a set of headphone that could be use for gaming and watch movies\/listening to music in general . as soon as the headphone arrive I be blow away by the soundstage that it carry . I play game such as cs 1.6 and previously with my old headphone I could hear the general location of where thing be , and with these new headphone I could hear the precise location of where every grenade land , to the extent that it shock I . as I be grind the headphone in for the first few hour the sound quality seem a little weak at first , but as soon as a week or two pass by the sound become amazing . I enjoy these headphone so much that even as I be wear they I feel like I be listen to my surround sound speaker . a thing to note that it be hard to adjust to the switch of use headphone mainly compare to speaker -lrb- as I do not realize how loud the headphone actually be since I forget that I be use headphone and not the speaker , mean the loud sound you get at that close range might be dangerous -rrb- . all in all , the headphone be fantastic and worth the money , as I doubt I will be need any new replacement in the future . oh and , the appearance of the headphone in person do not look as cheap as it seem on the picture you see ; actually , they seem like high-class headphone , a luxurious set of headphone make with lovely material that make you feel like a king .
Headphone	POS	5	I have never leave a review before but could not resist let every one know what a great product these little bud be . I buy these bud after the original bud to my ipod finally break . what a great investment !! I just get back from a trip to Costa Rica and these thing be simply amazing on the airplane . I never use my ipod on the plane before because I could never hear without turn the volume up all the way and I still could not hear all that well . I admit I have to turn up the volume a tad with these bud , but not that much . -lrb- you do have to push the tip into you ear to drown out the surround sound . -rrb- every time my husband want to talk to I he have to tap I on the shoulder . these be also great if you have small ear canal . the extra small tip be wonderful and they do not keep fall out of my ear like the Ipod bud do . I also find they very comfortable when I wear they at night in bed when my insomnia kick in . at first I think the sound quality be not all that great , even after `` break in , '' but the more I have use these puppy the more the sound quality have improve . finally , I love the cord ! it do not tangle and seem to be very well make even though it be thin . over all , great product and worth every penny . I buy the blue one and may even buy the pink one to `` color coordinate ! ''
Headphone	NEU	3	maybe I have a peculiar shaped ear , but it seem these earbud can fall out quite easily . I have try all the different silicone size and it still do not fix the issue . especially when I be eat , the chew movement displace the earbud very quickly . another note , and this maybe be true of all in-ear earbud , be any movement to the wire will be translate to noise in you ear . I can hear all the rustle as I move around . other than these issue , sound quality be good compare to my stock ipod one .
Headphone	POS	5	these be great - money well spend ! they sound great , fit well and be very light and comfortable . it be exactly what I be look for in a set of headphone that I could use at the gym . and all at a great price from Amazon . thanks !
Headphone	POS	4	this be the consumer version of Sony 's professional mdr-7506 phone , widely use in the film and broadcast industry , which be standard issue at the radio station where I work . due to the shallow ear cup , I find they uncomfortable after about two hour . but they be rugged , compact when fold , and the coil cord be top . however , I have never be content with they sound . the high end be exaggerate . this can be useful for location recording , as it accentuate hiss and other unwanted noise . however , I can not recommend mix with these because it be hard not to overcompensate for they inherent brightness , and the strong high frequency quickly induce listen fatigue . these phone have be in production for two decade , but I prefer they little brother , the discontinue 7504 model , which have a more balanced sound . that say , I have not yet find a good , affordable alternative to the mdr-7506 -lrb- a.k.a mdr-v6 -rrb- . as other have note , the only difference between the v6 and 7506 be a gold-plated plug adapter , the length of the warranty , and whether the sticker on the ear cup be marked `` Professional '' or not .
Headphone	NEG	1	the earbud be useless ! they didnt even work . the poorly make product be obviously a reason for it be so cheap . waste my money and time
