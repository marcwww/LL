Movies_TV	POS	5	we have to wait a while to get this set , but it be worth the wait ! Great act , story line , and special effect !
Movies_TV	POS	5	the new Doctor who -lrb- David Tennant -rrb- have make this series fresh , exciting , and open it to a whole new generation . a great set ... would highly recommend .
Movies_TV	POS	5	fear this dvd set , at least if you be press for time . a season full of thoroughly entertaining , enjoyable science fiction tv episode straight from the UK be to be find within , and the temptation to put the next disc in and keep watch be terribly hard to resist . David Tennant certainly have some pretty big shoe to fill -lrb- nine pair of they , actually -rrb- , but he have really do a wonderful job in take on the role of the eccentric space\/time-wandering doctor . he be as delightfully quirky as ever , yet in a more hyperactive manner . full of frenetic humor and yet less distant emotionally , with more warmth and less sarcasm than he immediate predecessor . this make he a bit more likeable but also a bit too human perhaps ; it be easier to forget that he be not of this earth , although trace of # 9 's convincingly alien mean streak remain . and he oddball sense of wonder in the face of the unknown -- even werewolf have a certain `` beauty '' for he . in general , Tennant 's Doctor will prove to be a memorable one , I suspect , faithfully true to the character 's general persona while engagingly eccentric in its own very unique way . the storytelling have thankfully improve very much since the prior season . do not get I wrong , I like `` the complete First Series '' quite a bit , but this second time around the plotline seem less rush and the solution less sudden and out of left field . more of the story be two-parter , which help immensely in this regard . after all , the good old classic `` Doctor who '' tale gradually develop through four episode of about half a hour each ; two hour-long episode back-to-back amount to much the same thing , which may be about the ideal time necessary for a Doctor who plot to unfold . this season have a good mix of story too . many be good solid straight science fiction , and this be especially so of `` rise of the Cybermen '' -lrb- okay , even if the Cybermen 's inventor do seem like a carbon copy of Davros -rrb- , and along the same line the Doomsday battle between two classic Doctor who foe in the season finale be totally and utterly inspire ! I have dream of such a confrontation ever since I be a nerdy teenager watch this show religiously on PBS . more characteristic perhaps of the season as a whole though be story that straddle the boundary between sci-fus and horror in intriguing way , include a face-off with the devil himself . sound corny , but it be actually pull off well , downright scary but with just the right dose of agnostic ambiguity . not every episode be a masterpiece , of course . the masterpiece would not stand out then . and everyone will have they favorite . but overall this be a fine year 's worth of a excellent show in its latest incarnation , the New New New New New New New New New New Doctor who .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I be very pleasantly surprise when I see this movie . most Disney sequel be unwatchably awful , and Cinderella II be not very good . however , Cinderella III : A twist in Time be , for a direct-to-video release , quite excellent . the animation be very good , the music be passable , and the plot be interesting , but what really stand out be the re-characterization of Cinderella and the prince . the prince be very flat in the original film , but here he be get a recognizable personality , he be nice , and he be not stupid ; the evil stepmother have to use magic in order to get he to go along with she scheme . Cinderella get awesome . in the original film she be nothing more than singing sugar and fluff , but here she have very realistic reaction to heartbreaking situation , and she get very strong in addition to still be nice and kind . one of Cinderella 's scene near the end of the movie even feel a little bit like a animated fantasy action flick . the end , though a little unexpected , be also very satisfactory . the only real complaint I have be that the beginning of the movie be over-the-top silly , and Anastasia 's romance from Cinderella II be not mention except for a single image in the credit , but overall , if you like Disney movie , Cinderella III be definitely one to get .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	when I FIRST see it I hate it !!!!! it be a total disappointment !!!!!! a total disappointment !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I agree with couple of the reviewer here on -lrb- ... -rrb- regard this movie . one be R. Love `` primemaiden '' who say , `` do happily ever after mean anything to you people at Disney . '' yeah do not it mean anything at DISNEY anymore to live happily ever after !!!???? and another person who I profoundly agree with be also another reviewer of this movie at amazon.com , Princess fanatic , who say , `` I be go to stick this movie very far down in a closet and pretend it be never make . '' I say , `` WELL DONE MY DEAR lady , BUT DO you know what I say ?!?!?!!?! '' I say , `` THIS MOVIE should be BURNED to ASHES AFTER all the copy be confiscate from everybody who poss THIS ABOMINABLE DIMWITTED stupid RETARTED ZERO IQ LEVEL movie !!!!!!!!!

REALLY REALLY stupid movie !!!! WHOEVER MADE this I wish I can put him in the TOILET and FLUSH HIM DOWN . hope that will knock SOME SENSE INTO HIM !!!! o yes if possible I would give this movie -80 star , not 1 !!!!
Movies_TV	POS	4	its great to see Hackman reprise he operative character from `` the conversation '' .  the point of this film as to how far along we be towards `` 1984 '' and `` Big Brother '' be perhaps indicate by we lack of alarm about it . its interesting what the situational awareness the Feds can gain by have a emittor on the Will Smith character , its instructive conceptually as to how you could steer yourself and other unit to intercept or stay close without get too close . but this technology be show to collapse when the sensor be not `` cheating '' by the emittor and have to use line-of-sight collection mean to stay in contact with they prey in a cluttered urban environment . if you watch the film conceptually as a demonstration of military and possibly totalitarean technology its worth 4 star . if you watch it for entertainment and plausibility it lack realism since if the corrupt Feds want the Will Smith character 's tape they would have barge in , kill he and make it look like something else . of course there would be no film and chase then .  we should reject violently these `` reality '' tv show where such totalitarean surveillance means be take in jest like its a mere popularity contest : if you become a `` enemy of the state '' you get vote to be `` banish '' might not be a laughing matter .

Movies_TV	POS	4	the relevance of this film be strikingly frightening today . the unsuspecting John Q Public -lrb- Will Smith -rrb- be on the run , even strip down to he boxer to symbolize the insecurity of the average amercian by the ever-intrusive government swear to uphold we ineffective Constitutional Rights ; highlight modern technology go rampant under the guise of protect we supposedly inherent natural rights . the right to privacy be trample on by NSA agent -lrb- portray as young prying clown -rrb- under the command of a nefarious reptile play to a t by Jon Voight . the player in the system of illusory rights hound John Q Public since he unknowingly carry on he evidence of a congressman 's death and it be at this point where thing slowly unfold for the naive citizen as he be relentlessly chase by big Brother via satellite , ATM and tunnel camera , cell phone signal tracking , bug , etc. hit home the film 's point : privacy be a thing of the past . it even point out that a natural serene pond view of goose be not a safe place for some privacy . the film gain steam midway as a paranoidal ex-nsa agent , Brill -lrb- Hackman -rrb- literally knock some sense into John Q and show he the painful truth ; the truth that Joe Blow easily dismiss during a scene earlier into the movie . release almost 3 year prior to 9\/11 , `` enemy of the state '' bombard the sens with quick editing , hyper-action , and loud jolt of sound as if to say , `` wake up ! '' Orwell have be roll in he grave for some time now . one reviewer point out Brill 's birthday of 9\/11 in a quick flash scene . if only this be a coincidence and not a confirm nod to those who be privy numerologist , but consider the studio which release this film it should be of no surprise . so sit back , crack open a can of soda and pop open a bag of popcorn and pay witness to one man 's life quickly turn upside down by a power hungry , guilt-ridden government seek safety under its ever-intrusive eye .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this release seem to have draw out more eloquence and expertise from Amazon reviewer than most . it be clearly warmly regard as a classic by the great majority . pc issue , or rather the non-pc issue have be debate with well-conceived and finely deliver statement by both side . as be usually the case in such matter , I do not imagine that the disputant have move a inch from they original position -- or ever will . as for myself , I hold sufficiently warm feeling for Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' to endorse the many five-star rating it have already earn . I clearly remember see `` Peter Pan '' during its first run , once at a grand and lordly downtown movie palace on San Francisco 's Market Street and again , a little later , in second-run at a neighborhood theater on Mission Street . I be ten year old at the time and recollect that the movie be a thing of considerable interest among my friend and schoolmate . the consensus of opinion among discerning ten year-old be positive but not ecstatic . much the same be true for the review that run in the old News , Call-Bulletin , Examiner and Chronicle newspaper . -lrb- why be I pour over movie review in four daily papers at the age of ten ? I have no idea , but there you be . -rrb- the big advertising hook for the film be that for the FIRST TIME EVER !! Peter Pan would be portray by a boy rather than a middle-aged woman . we ten-year old be , as I recall , singularly unmoved by that . most of we be particularly well disposed toward Hans Conried 's Captain Hook and to the Crocodile , of course . both be authoritatively pronounced to be real zorch . -lrb- a San Francisco nonce-word invent by a then-popular disk jockey . it quickly give way before the better know `` cool . '' -rrb- on the other hand , we moppet film critic also generally agree with we elder professional who hold that `` Peter Pan '' represent a artistic fall off from Disney 's earlier masterpiece , `` Pinocchio , '' `` Dumbo , '' and especially `` Bambi , '' all of which have be re-release within we time horizon . -lrb- I be pretty sure that the next re-release of `` Snow White '' be much later . -rrb- compare to those true classic of animation , we think `` Peter Pan '' look cheap , cheesy and flat -- although I be sure we do not use those particular term , rely instead on the ever-eloquent , `` it be ok , I guess . '' in 1955 come the first black and white tv version of the New York musical with Mary Martin . it return in a new live -lrb- on kinescope for the West Coast -rrb- version and again in 1960 , that time in color , I think . as I remember it , that version have much greater impact . Mary Martin be simply better at everything than Bobby Driscoll be at anything . the musical score be better , too -- brasher and edgier than the Disney tune , which even in 1953 be move well along the path to the familiar musical pap so beloved by Uncle Walt . that be then , this be now . Mary Martin 's three `` Peter Pans '' be mere historical artifact , while this `` Peter Pan , '' like its hero , shall remain forever fresh and young .
Movies_TV	POS	5	cute animated movie . however this be NOT the DISNEY version
Movies_TV	POS	4	I rent this expect it to be totally mediocre , but at least worth a 3 $ rental . I be pleasantly surprise to find this very watchable , thrilling , and something I 'll probably rent again . Will Smith be great and easy on the eye . all the acting be very good , though Jon Voight have pop up in so many movie lately I be start to get tired of he . I do not figure out how it be go to end , and the final showdown , plus how the main character outwit the bad guy be great . Tom Sizemore I do not recognize at first since he be put on so much weight , but he be fantastic . I give the writer extra point for not go for the cheap shot and have the bad guy kill Gene Hackman 's kitty -lrb- if they have , I would have only give this movie one star , and probably not watch the rest -rrb- . I think that they do kind of beat you over the head with the `` SURVEILLANCE be BAD '' message . after the first half hour it be like , ok , I get the idea guy . the various fictional super-sophisticated tracking device be cool , and Tony and Ridley Scott always shoot they film beautifully . oh , and the woman who play Will Smith 's wife kick a $ $ !
Movies_TV	NEG	2	I will not lie . it be be over six year since I have actually see this movie . back then I do not like it . I still do not . but now , I have realize something : there be symbolism in this movie . you see , Peter Pan represent a certain someone . who , you ask ? come closer . now , we all know that the character Tinkerbell be model after , -lrb- or at least draw to the likeness of -rrb- , Marilyn Monroe . coincidence ? I do not think so . can you guess who Pan be yet ? oh-kay , Peter Pan stand for John F. Kennedy - you know , irresponsible , young , womanize , etc. . do not believe I ? look at Pan ! he be dress in green , the color of the Irish . he associate with not one , not two , but three woman in this film . sound like JFK to I . wendy stand as the voice of reason , Jackie . Captain Hook , of course , be Lee Harvey Oswald , and that alligator ... or crocodile ... thing , be Jack Ruby . Odd , be not it ?  Well , I hope you have enjoy this little essay ... or review ... or ... ah , whatever .

Movies_TV	POS	4	as a fan of the original series - especially the golden age of Tom Baker -lrb- when he be still take the show seriously -rrb- - I have not be disappoint with the new `` who . '' from the wonderfully rework title sequence and theme tune -lrb- so much better than the tinny version that introduce the show from late Baker onward -rrb- the new series maintain much of the charm of the original without the wobbly set . I love Christopher Ecclestone 's portrayal of the Doctor , so await this second season with a little trepidation . although I find David Tennant 's Doctor a little more superficial , he do a creditable job nevertheless . but why oh why be BBC dvd SOOOOOO expensive ? sure , they be generally a quality product , but that do not justify charge two to three time as much as for a equivalent US series . sorry BBC - until you price be competitive , I 'll be rent this and future who , not buy they .
Movies_TV	POS	5	note : as of this moment , the Two-Disc platinum edition of Peter Pan be in limited distribution -lrb- I have see it -rrb- and most of the review that appear now refer to a earlier version . the Two-Disc platinum edition version can be pre-order from Amazon and Borders and offer new special feature which include a restore original theatrical soundtrack all-new digital restoration with enhance picture and sound , `` Camp Never Land : explore never land '' with all-new multi-level game , delete song , a feature during which Walt Disney explain `` why I make Peter Pan , '' `` the Peter Pan Story : 1952 '' featurette , a sneak peek of the all-new Tinker Bell movie , another feature `` you can fly : the make of Peter Pan , '' a t-squad music video : `` the second star to the Right , '' a Peter Pan virtual flight , Peter 's Playful Prank dvd storybook , and a never-before-seen alternate opening . over the year , I have see various version of this delightful film and enjoy it at least as much now as I do when it be first release in 1953 . on several occasion , I have also visit Disneyland and vividly recall the excitement of the ride when my companion and I depart the child 's bedroom and fly above London at night en route to Neverland . the so-called `` magic kingdom '' be more a state-of-mind than a location because the genius of Walt Disney and he associate be that , in way and to a extent no one else ever have , they activate and engage imagination . this be especially true of this film that , unlike most of the other animation feature , involve a journey by air as well as by land . literally , one 's imagination soar above and beyond human concern , at least for 77 minute . unlike other Disney villain -lrb- e.g. honest John and Stromboli in Pinocchio , the Queen\/Witch in Snow White and the seven dwarf -rrb- , Captain Hook be at least as amusing as he be threaten . the fate of the darling child be never really in doubt . we know that eventually , theirs will be a safe return to they home and family . -lrb- I have no such confidence - as a child -- when first view Dumbo , Pinocchio , and Snow White and the seven dwarf . -rrb- although for most of we , `` there be no place like home , '' we enjoy and appreciate opportunity to travel far and wide - at least in we imagination - and become involve in adventure of various kind , as the darling child do . those who already have a earlier version of Peter Pan can continue to enjoy it , of course , but at least some of they will welcome this Two-Disc platinum edition because of all of its special feature , previously unavailable . I only wish other dvd offer special feature of comparable variety , quality , and entertainment value .

I -lrb- and probably anyone else besides ROGER EBERT -rrb- WOULD GUESS that this mean it appear as it be originally show in THEATRES - WIDESCREEN ! I be more than tick to find LATER that it be in fact a pan and scan version , and after pay not a SMALL SUM of MONEY , I feel a little rooked .  my suggestion be to keep watch that WORN OUT VHS COPY UNTIL DISNEY decide to invest a little more in one of their crown achievement . oh and do not WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT that LIMITED ISSUE NONSENSE MEANING that THEY ONLY MANUFACTURE EACH MOVIE TITLE ON A LIMITED NUMBER RUN ONLY once per generation -lrb- with DISNEY , GENERATIONS be BORN QUITE OFTEN -rrb- . right now , THEY OBVIOUSLY be have a gigantic case of TIGHTWADITIS and YET be still pricing THEIR TITLES WELL above OTHER studio . sad , sad , sad !  i ONLY HOPE WE all can see this movie in ITS FULL WIDESCREEN GLORY and SOUND SOON !

Will Smith 's smart-@#% remark be fresh and funny in Independence Day but now they just irritate I . how many time can he play the same stereotypical character ? id like to see he do some serious drama , for he have at time show the ability to do so . this movie just fall flat . Run , jump , watch out theres a helicopter . Yawn . ive see Xfiles episode with similar story line that put this to shame but do it with a small fraction of the budget . what a waste .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this movie lack any level of credibility . the technology be ridiculous from the start and get worse as the movie continue .

Movies_TV	NEU	3	I do not remember ever be that take with Peter Pan when I be younger , it certainly be never my favorite , but as I have mention in previous review , I be collect the special edition , and wait -lrb- im -rrb- patiently for the one that have already be out , and go again . convenient how they be release these special edition around every 6 year or so , just in time for the next generation to start clamour at they parent that they want they ! while I find Peter Pan funnier than I remember -lrb- Mr Darling , Smee , Captain Hook & the croc -rrb- , I could not help but see Bob Hoskins as Smee and Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook - yes I have see Hook way too many time ! apart from that , I notice that , although not as much as the earlier Disney movie , there be still some reference that I really do not think should be in a kid movie - the fairy dust for instance ? that make they fly ? how many of you try to jump off you garden fence or you garage when you be young ? and also the fact they show John smoking what look like very suspicious substance . but this certainly would not be show in today 's very politically correct Disney . there be also some terrible stereotype about american Indians . I find Wendy 's voice as irritating as usual , but I definitely find it familiar , so I be probably still remember it from when I be young . Peter be never a favorite character of mine and like Walt Disney himself , I find it to be really cold and quite unlikable . this be a must for collector , with the usual special feature , although if you find yourself bore during the game , that be because they be aim at kid . not we old one . unless you fancy try the 9x9 suduko - I could not do it . the next special edition be the jungle book , out in the autumn , not particularly another favorite of mine , but I be still look forward to it .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	season one of the show in reincarnated form be not bad . the older doctor have a air of experience and wisdom . season two 's younger version of the doctor seem to lack that . the actor have he own humor and twist to the character . we 'll have to see how the season and series progress with he in the role .

Tennent 's 10th who , -lrb- who -rrb- I also think do quite well in `` Cassanova '' be a silly eccentric with more on be a crazy imperfect himself and eccept that than be obligate to appologize afterwards as do Chris E. . Billy Piper odviously do not speek `` Pig Common '' though as she fake accent sometimes faulter in situation that Pig Common can not artiqulate as in the bazaar sci-fus word and reaction to alien . usually she come off fine in normal situation that call for the Pig Common charm . Might I suggest try to emulate Peter Woodthorpe who be the `` scum of theive '' in he speech . also he be Gollumn in the Baski Lord of the ring . the boyfreind be a backwheel and depict k-9 as such insulting both character as be as such when they could be more pivotal and take more seriously by the audience if thing be just leave to roll on . Doc # 9 hate everyone in Rose 's life except Rose herself and this alienate the audience -lrb- at least I -rrb- from he . Tennent do this but to a lesser degree . -lrb- and it be a good thing to a degree -rrb- the irreprotiable 9 and 10 be both much like Tom Baker and Chris E. be more on William Hartnel with the exception that Tom Baker do not leave people to die becasue of questionable `` character '' as do Escleston -lrb- even will Hartnel 's 1st be merciful to we moron . -rrb- . Tennent have move away from the mondane and moralistic modernizaton of Earth and it be reala t show feel and be more like the doctor -lrb- s -rrb- of old . though the feel be still the way escleston 's story and atmopshere be which I do not really like . it be still entertaining and fun with tenent and though I like Escleston 's early one -lrb- usually writen by Russel Davies himself -rrb- he later one be more like Stargate and the cheapness of sci-fus channel stuff and it be P.C. feel . Briton have a weird way of conveigh idea to the audiance and I prefer the tone down morality check of tenent and even Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee who be more into the entertainment area than the informative area . k-9 be not a second bannana to the companion ! Sarah Jane be not a `` Ender '' or a dead wash-out as `` she make I smile in the end '' as the song -lrb- from she heyday -rrb- go .
Movies_TV	POS	5	doctor who have return to telelvision after a long hiatus , and it be still `` get it '' , to quote the Doctor himself . the second season\/series be exciting , frightening , dramatic , and fun all at the same time . it be good family entertainment . smaller child might find some of the alien a little frightening , but , as a parent , that would be my only concern with this program . virtually no swearing , no bed hop , or nudity , and at the end of the day , the doctor take a stand and do what he think be right , because he believe that that be what you should do .

I think the instructor be great , the scenery be pretty , and the workout be fun !
Movies_TV	POS	5	have love season 1 , the idea of a new doctor be a little daunting . my fear be lay to rest in the first five minute of the Christmas episode and by the end of that episode I be totally in love with David Tennant . he make the doctor he own while keep the essence of the character . and Billie Piper ? well , I see she first pop video when she first hit the music scene in England as a teenager . she have transform herself into a very good actress . she be perky without be irritating and cry REAL tear . you gotta love the girl who make the doctor smile . Piper play equally as well with tennant as she do with Christopher Eccleston . I will miss she be season 3 so all the more reason to relish the dvd set . season 2 be gripping , exciting , touching , funny , suspenseful , emotional , and simply bloody FANTASTIC ! I still cry during the final 2 episode . favorite episode be `` Tooth and Claw '' . this episode be not only creepy with its warrior monk and werewolf but set up Torchwood as season two 's `` hint '' game . Watch all the episode again and follow the trail of Torchwood . all the episode maintain the high standard set by season one and in someway surpass it . quality tv even if you be not a sci-fi fan .
Movies_TV	POS	4	enemy of the State prove to be as intelligent as it be exciting . Will Smith prove that he can act and Gene Hackman do a wonderfull job in he role -lrb- as do John Voit -rrb- . enemy of the state be definatly worth check out and one of the best thriller in a long time .
Movies_TV	POS	5	not only be the episode amazing , but the commentary and extra footage be completely worth the money spend on this dvd set . David Tennant 's Video Diary be funny and insightful into the making of the series , as well as he personal journey as the 10th doctor .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I buy this delightful dvd for my 4 year old grandaughter . she be so excite when she receive it for Valentine 's day . it be a great story and yes , it do have a twist that make it much different from other Cinderella movie . I would recommend this movie for any child but , especially little girl who think they be princess !
Movies_TV	NEU	3	Disney movie in general be just better than everyone else 's , but not so for sequel . Disney sequel be famously bad , with mediocre music and iffy plot . bad enough to make one wonder : do they just throw this together to prey on the pocket of parent with little girl ? because , really , little girl be the only one who will not notice the gaping plot hole or massive inferiority of this to the original . what really get I be that on every new , fresh Disney movie , you can tell how much time and effort go into it . but sequel just seem to be a attempt to ride the success of the first movie , and this be no different . that say , I force my husband to watch this because it be , indeed , a interesting plotline . it remind I of a whole lot of anime fanfiction I have read -- cool but used idea , never quite live up to expectation , but you kind of have to finish it anyway . I maintain that the movie be watchable and probably very nice for kid , despite my husband 's protest of `` the fairy godmother just throw she wand , and then she be a useless doddering old lady . not magical at all . what kind of fairy godmother just throw she wand ?! '' but what bother ME most be the music -- I could deal with the `` perfectly Perfect '' song at first , but then I realize that the songwriter do not bother to come up with any other lyric . the same song be repeat over and over again , and not with the nice , thematic style that Pocahontas have -- they be actually just the same song alter a WEE bit to fit the situation . mean either the note or the word , but never both . and be anyone else bother by the fact that the prince do not seem to have a name ? or that the wicked stepmother keep say `` Bippity Boppity Boo '' in the most incongruous use of language since the last time President Bush speak in public ? I watch it . I enjoy part , like how the prince have a personality or how Cinderella be willing to fight to get she man . but it be not the Cinderella of Walt Disney 's day . Walt would not have allow this to be put on the market like it be . he have standard .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I do not really think the quality could be improve on a older film like this , but this dvd be amazing . its like a brand new movie . Crisp picture and beautiful sound .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my wife and I become instant Doctor who fan from the moment we watch the first episode of Series 1 . I be worry when Christopher Eccleston leave the show , but David Tennant have turn about to be a excellent doctor . the Third Series will be a instant buy when it be release later this year .
Movies_TV	NEG	2	ever see a movie that take you so far that you actually see the character as someone really talk in front of you ? Will Smith , Lisa Bonet and Tom Sizemore -lrb- amongst the other -rrb- , be act too hard . they be not convince enough to make I feel like they be real character . again , the action be great . but the acting be contrived and predictable .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Peter Pan be a story for all child and adult to watch . it would be hard to imagine life without wendy , John and Michael travel with Peter to Neverland . or that trademark pixie tinkerbell with she magic gold dust that make the child fly . add in a group of lose boy , and the legendary evil pirate Captain Hook , and you have a classic tale for life . this story have magic , pirate , and imagination beyond all belief . the two disc set be nice to have in you collection . Watch the second disc , its load with stuff . Stephen John Beccia author of the treelander
Movies_TV	NEG	1	it be hard to put into word how bad this movie really be . normally , I have never have any issue with Disney sequel , like some people do ; in fact , I like they . I love Cinderella II because it play with the idea of the ` what happen after happily ever after ' ? Cinderella II be entertaining , for I , and it do not alter anything of the original story . this movie however be a disaster ; both of my girl be extremely disappoint by this movie . like someone else say it be a insult to the first movie and I would say the second one too . it seem that the producer , or writer , who make this movie could not think of any good story line , and end up only repeat the same thing over and over again . worst of all , it look like they do not bother to do any story continuance with Cinderella II . in that movie , Anastasia have already meet someone she love -lrb- the baker -rrb- and apparently she even have go to the palace to dance with he . in this story that start in Cinderella 's first wedding anniversary -lrb- which have the kid assume that Anastasia 's story already happen -rrb- we go back to Anastasia hate Cinderella and there be no mention of the baker . Anastasia be look for true love , but the problem be that if you follow the movie she be suppose to have find it already . the producer annul the first two movie so they could tell again a story that do not need fix . now it do need fix , because annul two wonderful movie so they can give we a mediocre sequel be quite a achievement . the movie be so absolutely horrendous that even the song be hard to listen too . the movie have nothing good to entertaining you with , but have plenty to leave you fume for hour if you be a Disney or Cinderella fan . to make thing worst , they deliver a mortal blow at the end of the movie when Cinderella and Prince charming first year of marriage it be erase and they start all over again . so Cinderella 's first wedding never exist and we instead get that less than satisfy end . what be that for ? be they plan another sequel ? I hope that this be not the case ; because I be go to stick this movie very far down in a closet and pretend it be never make . it make I weep for what they have do to Walt Disney 's creation .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I buy this for my wife for Christmas , along with the Cinderella Collector 's Edition box and Cinderella II and she absolutely love they all . I also have a 6 month old daughter , who I know will also love these film . if you have a wife , girlfriend , daughter , or just anyone who love Disney movie , this be a must have for they collection .
Movies_TV	POS	4	yes , there be a scene miss from the 1953 Disney movie ! we watch it again recently after see `` Finding Neverland '' . I be wait for the `` if you believe in fairy , clap you hand ! '' part -lrb- my favorite moment in the original film -rrb- , but it never come ! what be Disney think ???!!! do anyone know if the unedited original be available for sale anywhere ?
Movies_TV	POS	5	excellent premise of Washington high tech crime in the national security community . Will Smith be better in this than in WWW . he be a good choice for this part . put he with Gene Hackman and you get explosive scene . excellent action footage and the cut room work be excellent .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my girl love this movie and I actually find myself watch along . I recommend it for all little Princess 's .
Movies_TV	POS	5	receive in excellent condition and before estimate delivery time - which I be extremely thankful for ! be extremely excite to have my very own copy , finally ! thanks !
Movies_TV	POS	5	incredible movie , great action , fine acting , Hackman at he be
Movies_TV	POS	4	I rent this movie from netflix because I just love rendition of the Cinderella story . I think that this would be something purely tacky that Disney be merely try to make a profit on . well , I dont doubt that they be at least try to make a profit , but it be surpisingly better than i anticipate . I love the twist on the story in which Cinderella need to save herself and work without magic to win the prince . it have a stronger feminist message . I also love how the end uplift the idea of want a man to love someone for who she truly be as well . it have a stronge feminist message as a result which i fully appreciate . but it do not take away any of the fun or emotional sense of magic within the underlie message . the reason I give it four star be because even though I enjoy the twist on this , its really hard to beat a classic !
Movies_TV	POS	5	amazing movie ! and great dvd quality . no scratch , come wrap in plastic . good buy ... 10\/10 !
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I be really disappoint with this release , I be expect a nice widescreen edition of this movie with great sound , but it be just a mediocre standard dvd .
Movies_TV	POS	4	this movie be one of the coolest movie ! I like wendy and John and -lrb- of course -rrb- Peter Pan . Captain Hook and Mr. Smee be funny too . I also like the mermaid ... they be so pretty ! however , this movie be probably least like the book out of all the Disney movie . in the book , Wendy 's father do not even threaten to give she she own room ! the book actually be better than the movie , which I give four star because they be so different . my favorite part of the movie be where they be at Mermaid lagoon , where Captain Hook be dangle off a cliff and Peter say `` I say Captain , do you hear something ? '' and you hear the ticking of the crocodile . I do not know why that be so funny to I . anyway , this be a cool movie , and if you have not see it you definitely should rent it . : -rrb-  P.S. what be the deal with Peter Pan 's voice in the sequel ? it be totally weird !!!
Movies_TV	POS	5	I be a fan of the older series , but David Tennant make the new series that much more amazing . he be perfect as `` the doctor '' and definitely bring a life to the season he have star in that make this truly the kind of awesome I have come to expect from Doctor who .
Movies_TV	POS	5	the best doctor ever on the best show on tv ! this sum it up , if you love classic Doctor who and have not have a chance to see this show just buy it ! I know you will love it ! David Tennant be the perfect doctor !
Movies_TV	POS	5	as a huge Doctor who fan , I could not wait to get my hand on this dvd set . I be not disappoint . aside from the great storyline and dramatic conclusion to this second season of the most recent installment of Doctor who , this dvd set have great extra with ton of behind-the-scenes look at the making of the show , as well as delete scene and blooper -lrb- always fun to watch -rrb- . I would recommend this to any fan of the show - it be absolutely brilliant .
Movies_TV	POS	5	purchase a number of the classic Disney video for my grandson and as you would expect they be great .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	this be another attempt of Disney 's to take one of they fondest character and stretch she likability and promise WAY too thin to earn a profit . even so , this film best they last direct-to-video installment , Cinderella 2 , which I turn off after just ten minute . this movie make you yearn for the original film and the magic that go into it . it do have its high point , though , in that I love see the stepsister character develop . maybe a better direct-to-dvd offering would simply be a stepsister biography ? anyway , some of the character action do not ring true . and a time-travel theme ? that might be better suit for a Star Trek movie . however , that be the gimmick that get I to buy this film in the first place ! maybe the next sequel will be Cinderella 4 : back 4 more , Race against the machine . if you must consider any Disney sequel , try Bambi II , which I believe be far superior .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	so yeah , I have not see this movie . I probably will and it probably will not be terribly stupid as some sequel be , but this pain I . greatly . Cinderella two be not the greatest disney sequel . the little mermaid 2 and mulan 2 be both better . so why be it that this one get 's a 3 ? why should any of they get a 3 ? if anyone from disney read this -- PICK ANOTHER FAIRY TALE !!! there be lot out there that have not be disneytize . Rapunzel , Rumpelstiltzkin , and then there be the one from other coutnry that western europe and Grimm and stuff . China -- like Mulan -- good movie . Make something new and original again . please !!! parent , babysitter , and teacher who have to watch these thing beg you !!

Movies_TV	NEU	3	actually buy it for my baby girl . be kind of cute but then again , this be suppose to be for child not adult . I recommend it to all the parent who do have little girl go through the `` princess '' period .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I have already see the other two Cinderella movie , so I think , why not watch this one too ? I must say that I be pleasantly suprised . this movie be very sweet and it show more of the prince 's side of the story , unlike the other two movie . I really love it . it be a great movie for younger girl . older girl could get into it too , see as I be 16 and enjoy it . all in all , a lovely movie .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	when this movie be release , the `` Evil Right wing '' Republicans be so blantantly portray as facist that they be almost parody . no more after the horror of Sept 11th -lrb- I be a survivor -rrb- , it be Will Smith 's wife -lrb- the wonderful ACLU Attorney -rrb- who it turn out be the characature . when she just brush off a republican Senator state on Larry King that there be 1000s of foreign nationial in america who hate the USA . she call he a facist ... what would she say now ?? I guess that would depend on if she have a loved kill in the Sept 11 attack . Afterall , ACLU lawyer seem to have the conscience of serial killer when it be innoncent man woman and child kiil who be no relation to they . but nevertheless , this movie be too disturbing to watch now that the real world have overshadow the liberal elite version of the world .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Sit back and get catch up in , I would say yhe best thriller of the year . Will Smith and Gene Hackman play together for the first time - and I must say that they be do it very , very good . I can not say more about this movie than - exellent .
Movies_TV	POS	5	what more can I say ? it be a classic - and it be Disney , can not get much better than that !
Movies_TV	POS	4	Peter Pan be a very fun movie . very childish happening . Tinkerbell be a classic assistant actress and be very selfish , mean-spirited and in love with Peter Pan . so when another try to get close -lrb- namely girl like wendy -rrb- she will not take to this lightly ! just watch and see ! it be a story that be be tell a thousand time but if you be a Disney fan , this have to be relive !! Peter Pan come to John and Michael 's nursery once in a while just to see how thing be . he inspire the child to play and imitate Peter Pan and the Captain Hook , and wendy , to keep the story alive . Neverland be any 6 or 7 year old kid 's fantasy world , but ANYONE can relive the glory that be Peter Pan . I do not wanna spend the whole night write this review but I will just say that it hold brilliance ; magic and such and should not be ignore ! get you copy tonight and make the child in you life smile over and over ! favorite character : Peter Pan , Michael , Tinkerbell and the Fox boy . : -rrb- Cover Art : b - inside art : C Story : b + character : a dialogue : b - comic Relief : b - music -lrb- score -rrb- : b + length : a - 4.2 star . overall : b -
Movies_TV	NEG	1	I purchase this as a birthday gift for my grand daughter and send it in the mail to she to she disappointment it do not work in any of the dvd player they have I be sorry that I buy this dvd and will not buy again
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be a very good movie about be in the wrong place at the wrong time .  in the overview of this movie this poor man , in the wrong place at the wrong time , lose he life . he be give something , which he do not even know he have . which implicate a high ranking government official in something that he do not want public . consequently he life be take away . he credit card cancel , he friend murder -lrb- he be frame -rrb- and the one person who can help he do not want to get involve because he know how the government work . the non-helpful person be part of a government agency in the past . Insights into the NSA and what they be capable of make this movie a eye opener .  highly recommend movie . Watch it , think about it , worry about it . you must get the movie for the detail but this movie be one worth watch and one that will make you think . along with entertaining you while it be one .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have be watch Doctor who for decade . I have love they . I be happy to season the Doctor come back . last season be great , and what we family have watch thus far be great . welcome back doctor !
Movies_TV	NEG	2	I order both the Walt Disney Peter Pan video and the Mary Martin Peter Pan video for my son at the same time and the difference between the two be shocking . Walt Disney have exaggerate to the point of stereotype many aspect of the story . for example , Tinkerbell , who represent a spirit in the story of Peter Pan , in the Walt Disney version be such a flirt and jealous , as well as overly concern with how big she hip be that the whole meaning of she be lose . the indian in the Walt Disney version be stereotyped as well and I be shock that as my son now say Indians do not have face . the Walt Disney version contain much unnecessary violence . all and all the Mary MArtin Peter Pan be so much more heart-warming and magical and fun .
Movies_TV	POS	5	enemy of the state star will Smith and Gene Hackman . neither of these fine actor make a bad movie that I know of . this be a fine thriller movie about government surveillance and a bad national security agent play by Jon Voight . the good news be that the surveillance technology feature in this movie be for real and target against US enemy . the bad news be that sometimes the government thing we be the enemy .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	buy this dvd think it might show a few more dancemove for Bollywood . I be so disappointed with it ! 3 woman in a Bollywood inspire set who frollock about for 50min demonstrate move that a 5 year old would do better . very badly demonstrate and not at all ` sassy ' ... this be constantly use to describe what you should be do while dancing . not at all inspiring and ideal for 14-16yr old who fancy themselves . really bad dvd and it be not a workout . save yourself the bother of get it only to return it and just get any of the other dvd !! such a pity as some of the review be positive and influence my decision to purchase - will be more cautious in future .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Amazon be the best site out there for good service . the movie be great my grandkid love it .
Movies_TV	POS	4	Will Smith do it again ! after watch this movie I want to shut the blind , turn off the computer , unplug my phone and live like a hermit ! it be non-stop action from begin to end . my eye be red at the end of the movie because I be too afraid to blink and miss something !
Movies_TV	POS	5	when I get this , I think it would be a fun , easy workout for my lazy day . boy be I surprise when my leg start burn halfway through the dvd . the best workout be the one where you can have fun , and not feel as though you be work out wait for a repetition to be finish . she encourage you to move at you own pace throughout and for once you do not feel like you be slack if you modify it a bit . I thoroughly enjoy this and will add it to my routine . it be the perfect workout to lift you mood , especially on lazy day . highly recommend it .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	I want my 5 yr . old twin grandson to be able to see what a great movie Peter Pan . they love it !
Movies_TV	POS	5	I like this movie alot . it do not just start you off from somewhere you would not be able to tell what be go on . it give you the blow by blow and tell you how thing like this can happen .  will Smith be a lawyer who get involve in something by accident . he friend from school drop something into he bag without tell Smith that it be a important government tape that could get he kill . the friend meet he demise and Smith be stick with the tape . the plot ensue that the government be out to get the tape back and Smith do not know .  it be interesting to see how something like this could happen today . anyone with a spy cam could get any info about you . imagine what the government can do .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be one of my favorite movie ever . a long movie by usual standard , but very compelling and very entertaining . the extend version run about 140 minute , 8 minute longer than the blu-ray version .
Movies_TV	POS	5	spoiler follow Walt Disney 's 1953 animated film `` Peter Pan '' be one of several film that help build a sterling reputation for the company 's feature-length animation . with the voice talent of Bobby Driscoll , Hans Conried , and Kathryn Beaumont , it remain timeless entertainment . a adaptation of the James M. Barrie story , it boast artistic , sophisticated animation that hold up brilliantly even compare to the contemporary computer-animated market . for instance , Peter Pan 's first appearance , crouch in darkness on a rooftop , suggest the character 's magical nature and even a subtle hint of the unknown and the potential for danger . the relationship between Peter , Wendy , Michael , and John give the movie tremendous heart . Peter 's companion sprite Tinkerbell be also meticulously draw and animated , and have garner she own place in Disney lore . Bobby Driscoll 's vocal work as Peter Pan be one of the finest , most recognizable voice in Disney 's canon of character . it be a perfect blend of mischief , stubborness , and most importantly , youth . Hans Conried do double duty as the villain Captain Hook and Mr. Darling , father to wendy , Michael , and John . in a animated setting , it be impossible to imagine anyone else in these role . Mr. Conried voice the fussy father very well , and as Captain Hook create one of Disney 's classic villain . he characterization be silkily evil , but he be also able to play the more comical side of the character . Kathryn Beaumont be perfection as wendy , a potent mixture of authority and genuine care in she voice . as one of the few female character from that earlier Disney era who be not a princess , the character of wendy be very interesting . emotionally strong and wise , Wendy Darling be one of Disney 's best female animated character . also feature great song like `` you can fly '' and `` follow the Leader , '' Walt Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' be one of the golden masterpiece from the company .
