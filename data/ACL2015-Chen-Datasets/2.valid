RiceCooker	POS	5	my wife and I use this to make rice for sushi because we want something to cook the rice without have to watch it . we follow the direction in the manual and the rice come out much better than expect . it be fluffy and not watery at all like what can happen when cook in a pot . we love this rice cooker and highly recommend it . it be extremely easy to use and we too buy it at target .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	it do what it be make to do -- cook rice . it take up very little counter space . it be easy to clean . it be not a fancy rice cooker , mind you , and I wish it have a on\/off button -lrb- it automatically turn on when you plug it in -rrb- . for the price pay , it be a decent addition to my kitchen , even though it probably will not be use that often .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I own two other rice cooker and this be the best and my favorite . I can not wait to make bread in it ! it be a small rice cooker that be perfect for a small family . add a bit more detail as of May 25 , 2009 - I really can not say enough about this rice cooker . I use it on a daily basis to make jasmine rice . my jasmine rice come out perfect on the quick cycle . try add a little bit of olive oil in with the rice before it begin boil . not too much . I have find just a little bit of olive oil give it a nice sheen and keep it from gum up and get too sticky . of course , sometimes sticky be good . especially when make korean bbq . yum !
RiceCooker	POS	5	wow . just wow . stunning , simple , perfect rice , every time . throw it in , press a button , and in just over a hour you have get perfectly cook rice . ca not say enough positive thing about this model . I have use it for a month now , and it continue to impress . one of these day I 'll read the manual to see what the other button do , but since I get it I have just use the big red cook button , and the off button .
RiceCooker	POS	4	this be a great little rice cooker . I carefully read the review before buy it so I know what to expect . it be not perfect but it do a fine job as long as you remember what it be . its sort of like a small coffee maker , great but have its limit . I make a pot of brown basmatus rice . the recipe book be pretty accurate on how to cook brown rice . sometimes those book be not as comprehensive as you might like . at the last minute , I add some veggy and let they cook in the steamer . the result be a nice ` fry rice ' without the fat and soy sauce ! yummy I add some cook organic chicken to the mix once it be out of the pot and have a great dinner . I would recommend this little cooker if you be a single person and do not want giant pot of rice .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this look to be of higher quality than the last one i buy somewhere else and at a cheaper price i also would like to thank the seller for a fast shipment
RiceCooker	POS	4	make just about enough rice for too people to have a light meal , very good for the price but some people may be surprise by how small it be
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I buy this product 6 month back . work well for I until last week when it suddenly stop heating . consider other 1 star review where it break only after 2-3 week , I find myself lucky to have extract 6 month of use from this . nevertheless one buy these thing to last longer than that ... do not recommend .
RiceCooker	POS	5	it do a excellent job of cooking for a single or double serve of rice while the meal be finish up . lot of complain about they break early in the first year , but after 5 month and 30 use , I have have no problem .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I guess there be not a lot of variety in how the rice end up ... although , I suppose I could try add less water ... but anyway , it be a lot easier than cooking rice from scratch . this machine work perfectly .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I really love this rice cooker . I order another after mine get beat up in a move , because I could not imagine life without it . I will not lie , I be a great cook . but for some reason , I can never seem to cook rice correctly . it always come out burnt or mushy , or I forget to make it for my chinese food altogether . this little rice cooker be TINY , so I do not mind leave it out on the counter all the time . for I and my bf , it make plenty of rice , and then some . I just pour in my rice , water and some salt , push the button and forget about it , and a little while later I have perfectly cook rice ! I have not try the little steamer tray that come with everything , but it do come with it . probably could not hold much more than a cup of veggy . the only con I can think of be that the lid can get pretty messy with the steam and froth bubble out the top , but it be easy to clean , along with the bowl . so convenient and cute ! great for 2-3 , maybe 4 people , probably not suitable for more than that .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	my friend recommend I to buy this rice cooker but the rice cooker break down just now . I buy it Dec 21 2011 ...
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be really please with this rice cooker\/slow cooker . it be simple to use and work very well . my daughter , husband and I be all use it and it be worth the counter space it take up . we have be cooking rice a whole lot more and I have also use it to make pot roast -lrb- 7 hour on the slow cooker ! -rrb- this be a great size machine for my family of three , I would recommend it for a family of four also .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have own rice cooker in the past , and my only complaint be that they be hard to clean because they have a hard-to-clean interior . this rice cooker have a wonderful non-stick surface that be easy to clean . it be fast , it be easy to use , and it make great rice ! it do not make a whole lot of rice , so you might want to get a larger model if you have a large family . I only ever make rice for myself , so this thing be perfect .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have to have a great rice cooker . not just one of those cheap one with the glass lid that almost no one in Asia have anymore , but a fancy , computerized one . so when I see this rice cooker on Amazon and see that it have a separate pot for steaming\/slow cooking , I be sell . I actually have my eye on a 5.5 cup Zojirushi cooker before , but the feature -lrb- compare to this Sanyo one -rrb- just do not compare or justify the price difference . Have have this cooker for about three month now , and have use it at least once a week -lrb- some week more , some week less ... it vary due to my schedule and pantry item -rrb- . Rice come out cleanly and evenly-cooked every time -lrb- even if I add too little or too much water -rrb- . I have be cooking jasmine rice and brown rice in here , and have be able to keep both jasmine and brown rice in the fridge for up to five day without it spoil and get too hard to eat -lrb- especially for fried rice -rrb- . I have also steamed dumpling in it , and the only complaint I have regard that be that I wish there be a better steam tray for this unit . the steam tray that come with this cooker have concave dip in it to accommodate 8 egg , and that get slightly annoying , but only from a aesthetic point of view . not really a dealbreaker ! the recipe booklet that come with this cooker have some great recipe idea . I have only try the beef rice jook recipe so far . it be a bit on the thick side -lrb- like the consistency of REALLY thick oatmeal -rrb- , but it at least give you a start point to tweak the recipe to you liking on some popular asian -lrb- mainly chinese -rrb- dish . timer function be great , if a bit confusing to remember the first few time , along with the 12-hour warming function -lrb- though I have never have to use the warming function for longer than a hour so far -rrb- . no warming function for rice porridge , but if you turn the unit off and then back on again , it will automatically stay on `` warm '' . the noise that this unit make when you food be do be also not the usual somewhat-annoying , very cheesy musical tune that a lot of other fancy rice cooker have . it be just a standard beeping noise , and not too annoying or long . overall , I could not be happier with this cooker . if I can find a better steam tray so that I can maybe steam some meal with my rice , I would be in heaven . this cooker definitely have the potential to do it all .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be well worth the price . it slow cook the rice , but it taste fantastic . I have own this cooker for two year with moderate use and have have no problem with it at all . it be the best kitchen accessory I have ever buy .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this little rice cooker\/stamer be great use it all the time . my husband love it very easy to use pefect rice all the time .
RiceCooker	POS	4	this be a 6 cup rice cooker ... right ? on page five under the head `` cooking rice '' the manual read ... `` this cooker can cook up to 1 1\/2 measure of rice and yield a maximum of about 3 cup of cook rice '' . this little statement will leave you rack you brain when you compare it to page 7 which indicate that to yield 5 1\/2 cup of cook rice you should use 3 rice meaure -lrb- each measure be 3\/4 cup -rrb- and fill the water up to the 3 cup mark . I have to call customer service to find out which be correct . the answer be that the guide on page 7 of the manual be correct . the statement on page 5 -lrb- five -rrb- be simply incorrect accord to the customer service rep. I ignore page 5 and put in 3 full measure of rice and i can verify that it yield just over 5 cup of white rice . one other note ... the rice measure have to be fill to the brim to be a full `` measure '' of rice . ignore the very pronounced ring of plastic just below the rim . it be just another confusing issue with this product . Edit : so we have be use this product for quite some time now . I have move past the mistake in the instruction . if you consider the price , this thing be darn near amazing . I can not give it 5 star since the actual yield be less than advertise . I will say that we have use this to cook flawless Quinoa -lrb- try it with seafood stock to go with you salmon -rrb- , brown Rice and white rice . we use this silly little appliance a lot . I be add a star .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have have the regular inexpensive rice cooker from wal-mart for year . they cook rice fine , or so I think . I want a rice cooker that look attractive sit out in the kitchen . I buy the aroma arc-150sb 20-cup Digital Rice Cooker and Steamer . I expect a prettier appliance that do the same job . I be so surprised when I taste my first bite of rice ! the rice be cook so well . it be fluffy , tender , not hard or mushy , but perfectly cook . it cook brown rice so well . the steamer be amazing . this appliance really steam quickly and well . it work just as well to cook rice and steam vegetable at the same time . this product really have impress I enough to take the time to write this review . it be well worth the 30-some dollar I pay for it on Amazon.com . I check e-bay and a bunch of other retailer and Amazon.com be by far the least expensive . and I get free shipping . it arrive with in two day of order . great product , great shopping service , great price !
RiceCooker	POS	4	the rice cooker work fine . it be smaller than I think . the web say it could contain 8-cup . however , customer should know that 8 cup contain of 4-cup rice and 4-cup water . so it be fit for 1-4 people .
RiceCooker	POS	5	get it for $ 100 . just use it for half a month , and still not quiet familiar with all of its function . but it do good job . I be simply satisfy .
RiceCooker	POS	4	even though the rice cooker stop work , I be still give it 4 star because it be good when it be work . after I have wash the pot , I would consistently put it back onto the cooker , so maybe the cooker have water damage from my carelessness . only thing I do not like about it be that it be not able to keep rice warm for a long while , it end up burn the food at the bottom .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I be Japanese\/American , and have eat steamed rice all my life . have own a rice cooker almost all of my adult year . this be my second Zojurishi cooker . own a Zojurishi be so way worth it . why ? it just plain cook the rice as well as it can be make . I few year ago , I relocate to a far away local and eventually purchase a run of the mill rice cooker , and never like it . finally purchase another Zojurishi and now think I be silly for the time I do not have it . full feature and cooking option be cool too . the only draw back on my current model be that it do not have a run off for excess condensation , like my other one have . this do not affect the quality of my rice , just a noticeable difference . I shop and Amazon offer a excellent price with free shipping . no brainer .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I expect it to be a little bigger than it be . but it work great . no problem so far . Hope it will last long .
RiceCooker	POS	5	product make wonderful rice , much lighter than use the stove . read problem with these rice cooker boil over . I have only make upto 2 cup of brown rice , not 3 so I be not sure if make 3 cup would cause the water overflow people seem to have . it also steam vegtable , but this model seem small to bother with .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	it be only be two week since I buy it but it be already not work ! the life span be so short !
RiceCooker	POS	5	it cook Rice and yep it work , wonderful little cooker for when you just need a cup of rice cook : -rrb-
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be my first rice cooker , so I can only compare it to cooking rice on a stove . this make perfect sticky rice . Use 1:1 japanese short grain rice\/water plus 2 tbsp of water , and 15-20 minute later you have rice you can roll into a sticky ball . I also try quinoa and it turn out perfect . I have try make that many time on the stove with average result . this rice cook be extremely small , but it be a perfect size for two people . I like it because it be small and fit in the cupboard easily , and it be very easy to clean . in the future I might upgrade to something larger and more advanced , but to be honest I do not see a need for it right now . this do a great job , and it be less than $ 15 . what be not to love about it ?
RiceCooker	NEG	2	the lid be attach to the cooker , so it be impossible to properly clean ... and the metal of the cooker be porous . I accidentally leave some vegetable in the cooker overnight . a common mistake -- usually easy to clean up after . but because of the porous metal on the inside of the lid , and the fact that it can not be unattached , it be impossible to clean the stench of rotten vegetable out of the lid . everything I make after that taste of it , until I finally have to throw the unit away . again . impossible to clean . you can not let it sit unwashed overnight , not even once . if you do -- forty dollar out the window .
RiceCooker	POS	5	although I have to admit I have only use this rice cooker in the ` Quick Cook ' mode , the rice have come out perfect each and every time . two japanese cup provide for about 4 serving of perfectly cook basmatus rice . what impress I the most be the high quality material and attention to detail in its design .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I purchase a aroma rice cooker and after I use it twice the lid would not seal . I contact the company and they never even bother to reply . lousy product , lousy customer service . waste money and time . I will never buy another aroma product .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be my second Sanyo rice cooker and its as great as the first . they be the best out there .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	the rice cooker initially work great , but after about 20 usage it start to go from cook to warm prematurely so the rice be not fully cook . it do not happen all the time once every 4-5 usage . the reason I bring this be to cook rice so I do not have to be around to watch it . be not a rice cooker suppose to cook rice automatically ? I do not know if I be the only one who be have this problem .
RiceCooker	POS	5	First off , I be chinese and be basically a life long rice eater . Rice be definitely my daily staple . I do not feel right when I do not have a bowl of rice or two in my stomach daily . therefore , I use rice cooker daily . my parent bring I up use Tiger brand rice cooker . I use to have a basic Zojirushi that I use to cook brown rice for 10 year until it finally stop work last month . great durable rice cooker , but near the end , the rice get burn on the bottom . I then buy a cheap aroma rice cooker from Walmart , but the brown rice come out hard , chewy and in one piece ! after do extensive research online and on Amazon , I decide to go with the Sanyo with fuzzy logic , since it get great review from many different website . since most Zojirushis in the US be no longer make in Japan , I figure why not get the best of both world : a reasonably price rice cooker with all the bell an whistle . I order this from Amazon Warehouse deal and the unit come literally brand spanking new . 2 nice , thick durable non-stick cooking bowl with accurate measurement on the inside for rice and water . I make a batch of brown rice and it come out great ! the timer be easy to use and work like a charm , beep when the rice be do . in the morning . I wash the rice and throw it in the cooker and set the timer to cook for dinner time . by the time I get home from work , I have a perfectly cook , tender , fluffy bowl of hot brown rice for dinner ! no burn bottom and so easy to clean , with no rice gloop to clean from the steam vent -lrb- like my old Zojirushi do -rrb- and two replaceable steam lid include . this machine be a wonder and a great deal ! you can spend mega buck on the Zoji or the Tiger , but why ?
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love my Zojirushi ! my only regret be that I do not buy the bigger one .
RiceCooker	POS	5	after research rice maker in general and automatic one in particular , I settle on the Zojirushi . I may have be prejudice a bit since I have already own one of they bread maker for several year , I use it at least once a week and I be more than satisfy with it . my experience have lead I to both trust they product and have high expectation for they . that say , I have find the rice cooker to be excellent . it do just what it say it do . I have already make several batch of white rice , brown rice and rice porridge , all do to perfection . it be simple to use and easy to clean and with the retractable power cord it store neatly and easily ; it be handle make it easy to retrieve from the lower shelf where I keep it . the direction for use could be better ; they seem to have be translate by a computer rather than a human . the direction for they bread maker be clear and easily readable , so they be capable of do better for this product .
RiceCooker	POS	5	make excellent succulent white rice . love it even better for porridge . able to use timer function , setup ingredient and porridge be perfectly make . texture be better than use slow cook pot or cooking old fashion way over the stove . I be american-chinese and I previously own a Zorushi rice cooker . do not worry about the absence of a condensation catcher on the Sanyo , as mention in some review , because it do not drip very much when you open the lid . I be delighted with this product . I buy this a month ago . my mom be visit and even she be impress with the quality of the cook rice . I will try brown rice and see if it be as impressive .
RiceCooker	POS	5	ok , I can not stand it any longer ! why be so many people freak out about the little cup ? it be 200 ml , or in between 3\/4 and 1 cup dry measure . most people eat more than they need to , it do not hurt to have a little smaller portion . and here be a secret that any of we from traditional japanese family know : put the rice in the cooker . put in enough water so that the water come up to the 2nd knuckle of you index finger -lrb- with the tip of you finger touch the top of the rice -rrb- . it always work , we use to do this in we old rice cooker that have japanese write only , it do not matter what the amount of rice be ; I do not know how\/why this work but it do , and when I meet someone that grow up eat rice everyday like I do , they all seem to know this trick . in regard to the timing-who care if the rice be do before the rest of the meal ? since there be that handy keep warm feature , just make the rice way ahead !! the reason it take longer in the rice cooker be the traditional soak time , help make softer fluffy rice . if you get stick-um on the bottom of you rice , it be prob . not a good quality , or you do not rinse it , or you need to fluff it when the timer say it be do with the cute song . they say max 4 hour for keep warm , but for about 30 year I have keep the rice warm for longer than that and have no problem with food poisoning or bacterium . if you can keep stuff warm in a crock pot all day , why not rice ? my mom be japanese and highly recommend this cooker . for those interested in ayurvedic food , it make great kitcharee -lrb- although not the soupy kind , put you spice and veggy and dahl right in with the rice , if you add too much water it cook until the water be steam out , take about 45 min . -rrb- I love my big Zojirushi cooker so much I be buy this smaller one for at work so I can have my hot soup or rice cooking and ready by mealtime !
RiceCooker	NEU	3	this small appliance change my life for one month until the slow cooker inner pot peel , crack and be render useless . prior to the pot give out , the product be great . I be steam and cook on alternate day make rice , quinoa and polenta in the rice cooker and a variety of slow cooker recipe . I can still use the rice cooker pot and be try to track down a replacement slow cooker inner pot ; part be not in stock with Sanyo US service center and Sanyo be unapologetic that they product crap out after a month of use . from amazing to annoying .
RiceCooker	POS	4	after read several review , I purchase one so that I would not have to watch over rice cooking . my mom come to visit , taste the brown rice & love it . I buy a second one as a gift for she .
RiceCooker	POS	4	first time work great ! need to adjust the water depend on the type of rice . Easy to do and great to have rice soooo easy .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	EMPTYSTRING
RiceCooker	POS	4	this rice cooker be right appropriate for I and my roommate , and it look so cute . I expect it would last long .
RiceCooker	POS	5	my wife and I have be very happy with this rice cooker . we frequently cook brown rice with it , and there be just no comparison to the messy inconsistent stove-top method . we cook 1 1\/2 cup each time -lrb- which seem to be the optimal amount -rrb- and get restaurant quality rice ! we have also use this rice cooker to cook quinoa -lrb- for which it work very nicely , just use the `` white rice '' setting -rrb- . it do not work as well , in my experience , for porrige or oatmeal - which we continue to cook on the stove . regardless , we have find this a invaluable addition to we kitchen appliance arsenal . I highly recommend it .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have a aroma rice maker , and it be ok , but this zojirushus be far , far better . no crust bottom , and the rice be truly perfect . very easy to use , very easy to clean and a perfect amount of rice for a two people household . Worth the money definitely . I have a zojirushus Breadmaker also and I be sell on this brand . Superior quality and performance in both appliance .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Worth the money -- perfect rice every time ! produce restaurant-quality rice , turn out nice and fluffy to perfection . I have cook from 1\/2 cup of rice to 3 cup of rice perfectly on this machine . the unit 's automatic keep-warm function keep rice at a ideal serve temperature until it be ready to be serve . the appliance come equip with a extra-large color lcd display with clock and timer function , a spherical inner nonstick cooking pan and heating system , a convenient detachable inner lid for easy cleaning , and a built-in retractable cord and clear-coated stainless-steel exterior . very easy cleanup . cook many different type of rice include white , sushi , porridge , brown , and quick cooking . accessory include a measure cup , nonstick rice spatula , and spatula holder .
RiceCooker	POS	5	apart from be the smallest rice cooker I have ever see it be still good for 2 people ...
RiceCooker	POS	4	we be pretty happy with the rice cooker - we want to eat more brown rice , but the time it take to cook means we never can do it on a work night -lrb- which for we be 6 day a week -rrb- . be able to throw it together on the way out the door and have it be ready when we come back in be fully worth the $ $ . have not try anything but brown rice so far , but we be thrill . my rating would go up if the instruction manual be a little better write - it be a bit vague and make it seem harder than it be . however , once you figure out how to do it , it be really simple , especially because it save you 2 favorite time for rice to be finish .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I love the convenience of this Panasonic rice cooker . though I have not steam vegetable during the rice cooking cycle use the steamer insert that come with it , I think it be a useful feature . the steam escape in several place and there be a side reservoir that you need to empty after each use . the steam come out of the top do make quite a mess , so be sure to have some paper towel handy . I love the retractable cord . all the rice I have make have turn out great . I highly recommend this rice cooker .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I never really think of myself as someone who make rice a lot , but I always hate make it on the stove . I look into a few rice cooker on amazon and see they be all pretty poorly review , except this one . this be the best appliance I have ever purchase , bar none . it make it so easy to get restaurant-quality rice in about 30-45 minute -lrb- depend on if you use the `` quick '' setting or not -rrb- , and rice become a variable that you do not need to worry about while prepare you dinner . it be just there and ready for you when you need it . I be not a great cook , but this thing be idiot proof . it be worth spend the money on it , I use it all the time and do not regret the purchase price one bit . buy one if you even remotely love have rice with meal , you will not regret it .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	this product be terrible . it last 1 month and it be not work anymore . definitely not buy this product . I be very very disappointed .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy this rice cooker on one of the lightning deal from Amazon , but after use it , would pay triple if I ever have to replace it . it be a tiny rice cooker , but it be perfect for multiple type of rice , quinoa and oatmeal . I use the cooker every morning to make a single serve of oatmeal . the device be really a set-and-go sort of thing , and automatically shut off when the rice or grain be 15 minute from be ready . as I say in the title for this review , I be guess this be go to be my best purchase of 2011 .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the best thing ever , WE MADE SUSHI and the RICE come out perfect and so do the sushi , it be everthe they say it be and more we steam vegtable with fish in it and it be great . thank you .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	we purchase this item but then find it to be not what we expect . this rice cooker make up to 16 cup . in other word you put in 7 cup of dry rice which end up make 16 cup . it say this in the description but title be just a little misleading . other than that , it be a rice cooker and work as such . I know I probably should not rate it on my human error of not read the full description but the title be a little misleading .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I do a lot of research before buy this and have have it for several month now . this rice cooker be great . Perfect rice every time ; white , brown , wild , rice of any kind . Easy to use , durable , easy to clean , compact , look good , a good user experience -lrb- the designer be think when they make this -rrb- . thing to be aware of : it take a while to cook the rice - over a hour for brown rice . also , porridge in Japan be a soup like substance so if you want the non-watery north american kind you will need to adjust the porridge to water ratio . if I remember correctly it be 1:2.5 ratio of porridge to water .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I never really eat much rice but this make really tasty rice like restaurant serve , its so easy , just measure , and put in water and hit start . do not forget to wash the rice ... actually so far I have make more bread than rice , the bread rock ... yeah it take a little time to mix flour , etc but its worth it , I have even start experiment with put chunk of cheese , tomato and rosemary in the bread , etc. . its so yummy . I want to try brown rice soon . the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bab set make a really moist stew type meal . I be glad I get it . it have turn I into a better cook which be not easy .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	this be a very nice steamer . but the cup measurement be NOT we cup measure so when it say steam 3 cup it actually do about 2 -lrb- maybe be asian cup size -rrb- so this be not a good size for a average family of 4 .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	last about 2 week . we use it twice , then the light would not turn off . we unplug and plug back in , will not turn on at all . I do not know how it happen . I have the red rival one that look just like it . last 6 year . this one , 2 week . junk . do not buy this one .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be a big fan of this rice cooker . it be compact , make perfect rice every time , and keep it warm as long as you need without dry it out . I have use it for white , brown , basmatus , and wild rice as well as smaller grain like quinoa . it be very easy to use and clean .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	from the very first time I use the aroma rice cooker , the switch for `` cook '' would move to the `` warm '' position within the first minute of cooking . I would catch it and push it back to `` cook '' . after about 5 use the switch completely break and I could not set it to anything . I have to say that if I do not have this problem I would have keep the cooker because the rice come out great and we enjoy it . I return it to Amazon and actually order the same one again . I guess my thinking be what would be the odds of get another one like that . well I guess I get the jackpot because the new one also have the same switch problem . I say , `` enough be enough '' and pick a Sanyo rice cooker . I do see in the review that someone else have the same problem with they aroma rice cooker , just think it be one-of-a-kind issue , guess not !
RiceCooker	POS	5	I havnt try white rice yet but brown rice come out perfect . I even put to much liquid I think , and it still come out great . brown rice do take a long time in it but I dont mind since it come out so awesome . I add chicken broth instead of water and small diced chicken . the entire pot be go within 20 minute . when I try white rice I will add more to my review .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I purchase this rice cooker over a year ago and use it about two time a week . Wether I cook white rice or brown , long grain or short grain , the rice come out perfect every time . the rice be the perfect moisture and consistency . it be great too that it automatically change to the keep warm function upon finish . this be really nice , allow you to have one less item that you have to worry about timing for . clean the rice cooker be easy too . the bowl that the rice cook in be easily clean with a soft sponge and some dish soap . the rest of the cooker can be clean with just a rag or paper towel , there will be some moisture and excess water that need to be wipe up . I be so happy with my rice cooker I just buy a second to gift to the mom for mother day .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I receive this rice cooker as a present , and I love it ! it cook the rice perfectly and steam the vegetable well . I have not try to cook meat it in , as I be a vegetarian , but it work great for what I need . I do add extra water when steam vegetable while cooking rice . I have cook asparagus , brussels sprout , and zucchini in this while also cooking rice . I have notice it sputter a little , but mine do not make a big mess as other reviewer have notice . I love that I can switch it on and walk away until ready to eat !
RiceCooker	POS	5	the rice cooker work as advertise . it require nothing except put in rice and water , plug in , and rice come out few minute later . it have quite a large capacity , probably capable of handle up to 10 people 's dinner rice . I only use for two people , and it be slightly bigger than what I need . otherwise , it be a reliable product for a pretty cheap price .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	so the positive about this cooker be that it make any steamed food very well . you can make rice , potato , throw in some veggy , and it all steam very well . very easy to make a one-pot meal . however , very few rice cooker will not do this . I like that there be not any fancy feature that make cooking difficult , the simplicity be good appeal . that say , if you do not wash you rice first you will wind up with starchy water spew all over you counter . I only fill this to the bare minimum to avoid this problem and I thoroughly wash my long-grained white rice -lrb- something you should do for better quality rice anyway -rrb- . I also have some serious problem with sticking after I finish cooking . I have try everything I can to get that crispy layer out and it ruin my sponge . I put in some oil , I spray the side , I have really try everything . it still stick ! I like the simplicity , hate the mess .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the most amazing appliance I have in my kitchen ! I do ton of research on steamer and then I find this , it have almost all positive review and the price be fair . I use this to steam fruit and vegetable for my daughter when she start eat solid and it work wonderfully ! I can also cook rice and chicken with vegetable at the same time , and dinner be do in 30 minute . also I make a fritatta the other morning in 15 minute and it taste so good ! I highly recommend this !
RiceCooker	POS	4	for the new year resolution to lose weight , I be cut down on starch food . the Zojirushi rice cooker be perfect for that reason . . set the program be simple and you be able to set it in the morning for whenever you wish it to be ready for you meal ...
RiceCooker	NEG	2	pro : small footprint , proper capacity for two people , quick cooking function for those time where you be in a hurry . con : it do not store rice for more than 8-12 hour without the rice get yellowed . we have a huge , ancient , dented , simple Zojirushi before get the Sanyo that could hold the rice for at least two day before it yellowed . with the Sanyo , you would better refrigerate any leftovers immediately . after a year , the Sanyo fail to work . the last pot be a horrific rice paste with dry grain on the surface . overall : it have a lot of software bell and whistle that do not help it make proper rice and apparently detract from that core ability . but hey , I like to use it to make rice on a daily basis , so if you want to use it to cook frozen bread dough or non-sticky rice with olive oil , go ahead and buy into the review here .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	do not bother with this one ... First off , I ' t do not even make 3 cup of rice , more like 1.5 cup . the first and only time I use it , the rice come out mushy . I assume it be user error , the second time I try to use it , it would not even turn on . I be rating it one star because that be as low as I can go
RiceCooker	POS	5	we buy this rice cooker from a store whose name rhyme with `` Halmart '' . think that we know how to cook rice , we load it up and fire away , only to get a tremendous mess of starchy goop that flood the top of the unit and flow down the side , collect underneath . -lrb- it stink and the stink get worse if you forget that it be there ... -rrb- after read review for other aroma rice cooker here on Amazon , I discover that soak the rice fix everything . and very fortunately , this unit come with a delay timer . just load the cooker with rice and water -lrb- measure , of course -rrb- , press `` Delay Timer '' for the number of hour you would like to delay -lrb- the number be the number hour when the rice will be finish -rrb- , and choose `` white rice '' or `` brown rice '' -lrb- brown rice be give we the most mess -rrb- . I have set the timer as little as 2 hour , and the mess be eliminate even then . I believe that more delay be better . I have set it as long as 12 hour . I do not know the maximum number of hour you can delay . con for this rice cooker : there be a plastic valve inside the lid that need to be clean often , and the underside of the lid need to be clean as well . it do not detach , so you 'll have to scrub with a wet paper towel . I have not try to steam anything yet -lrb- fish , veggy -rrb- . bottom line : I recommend this product .
RiceCooker	POS	4	ok . so I buy this because I really have to watch my food intake . so the rice cooker do a awesome job of steam the rice and veggy . I have steam beet in this and man they be awesome ! I give it 4 star because sometimes it be awesome if it have a on\/off switch . other than that it really be a great rice cooker . I be happy with this purchase . oh and ive have this rice cooker now for almost close to 1 year . so yes its pretty darn awesome .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I first buy a cheap-o cooker from target and it be junk . burn the first batch of rice . drop it in the recycle bin and start my research and even think the price be far more than what I have pay for the cheap-o from target , I absolutely do not regret it . Perfect brown rice ever time ... well worth the price .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I buy this Rice Cooker so I would be able to make rice with out worry about it . SO ... why would I want to go back after 15 minute and stir ? also the steam spout spew water all over . I can do that on the stove top with out any help ! I return this item and will try again with another one .
RiceCooker	POS	4	the aroma arc-150sb 20-cup Digital Rice Cooker\/Food Steamer work best for serve 2 to 4 people at a time . if you try to cook one cup of rice or oatmeal , it can do it but you must monitor it . if you do not eat rice , oatmeal , or steamed food , this will likely be a space consuming dust collector to you . I try cook rice and oatmeal , steam garden vegetable -lrb- carrot , broccoli , squash -rrb- , and baked a batch of brownie . the brownie be make directly in the `` rice basket '' and need to be monitor . I think it would have work better with a double-batch . no hard section of the brownie . as I usually need for only one or two people , I have mix feeling about get lesser result for small quantity . it be necessary to go with this size to have steamer basket capability -lrb- my primary need for the unit -rrb- . when you cook for 2 to 4 , it work very well . fuzzy logic make the unit versatile . it be not a re-warmer . -lrb- the unit take time to warm up and require moisture . you will waste time and electric and probably not like the result . -rrb- it be not a slow cooker . accept it . the unit have be easy to clean , and I have not have the horrible pasty mess that other rice cooker make . then again , I have alternate what I cook . maybe steam between cooking starchy food help . this cooker\/steamer do what it claim to do and do it well .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	the description be mislead . it have a capacity for 3 cup of cook rice , which be less than 1 cup of uncooked rice . this be a toy , not even make enough rice for 1 person . do not buy it .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I get this rice cooker for my 84 year old grandma . she need a small , basic cooker with a nonstick interior for easy clean-up -- nothing fancy , no multiple setting or button . it be perfect for she . the only drawback be the fact that the nonstick interior be dark , so it be difficult to see the line which tell you where to fill the water . -lrb- again -- it be for my grandma -- other might not have a problem here -rrb- . she say she like it , and it be a snap to clean up .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have use and own several rice cooker . this be a very reliable model with good capacity . it make really good rice . be sure not to lose the measure `` cup '' because it be smaller than a regular cup measure . I do not think you can cook brown rice and I never have -lrb- I think you need the fuzzy logic cooker to do that -rrb- . this rice cooker should last several year .
RiceCooker	POS	5	the first day i get this , I make white rice . it be as fluffy and amazing as the best resturant rice . the second day , I make brown rice . it be the first time I have ever enjoy brown rice . it be more flavorful and have a more enjoyable texture than white rice -lrb- but only when make properly -rrb- . the zj make rice flawlessly , and every batch come out the same . I just put in rice and water and set the timer , then I wake up to perfect brown rice for breakfast . the only annoyance be the lack of a count-down timer . but that be no reason to avoid this cooker . just buy it . do not fret about the price . it be worth it for the convenience , reliability , and health benefit .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I think I could trust the Black and Decker name ... not so . this useless piece of equipment stop work after two use . when I call the customer care number -lrb- the bold black number on the front of my Rice Cooker user manual that say customer service -rrb- I be tell it be a company that offer customer reward . think I have misdial , I call back ... same result . I explain I do not want any reward offer , just want to talk to customer support . they cave I a toll free number ... turn out it be a 1-800 number directory number . . not B&D; support . I give up since I do not think this item warrent any more waste time . I 'll be cooking rice the old-fashioned way , unfortunately .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have use many rice cooker before so i know a good one when i see it . it be a excellent choice for people who do not want to cook a huge quantity of rice at one set or for those who want to eat fresh cook rice every day . it have a warm setting to keep the cook rice warm as long as it be plug in , a excellent feature . at this price , this product can not be beat .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have not baked bread as of yet , but the rice cooker function work great , much better than the $ 25 machine it replace . I like the quality of this unit because you can tell it be well build unlike the other
RiceCooker	POS	5	it be so beautiful and fit girl ! i think it be enough for a college student ! I like it very much !
RiceCooker	POS	5	make lovely soup , stew and roast with ease . Digital programming allow you to set the timer , go to work , and come home to a tasty meal that have be keep warm for you . Rice cooker be also great : rice come out perfect every time -lrb- since you choose how you want it -rrb- , and stay warm . most importantly , the rice be still edible the next day in the cooker . the combination of these two function -lrb- slow cooker and rice cooker -rrb- save space in my already too cluttered kitchen . the one caveat be that it do require two different interchangeable pot and lid , so you still need to make room in you cupboard for the pot and lid not be use .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	just have the second one of these die after only 3 or 4 use , same as the first . a false economy to go this cheap . I 'll be look for another brand .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Rice be something that be make at least once a week in my household . previous to purchase the Sanyo ecj-hc55 rice cooker , I have a simple Oster rice cooker that do a adequate job . it only have a toggle switch that cook the rice . it make pretty good white and brown rice , but there be also some issue with it . the bowl be lightweight and the non-stick coating be flake off . also , when the unit signal that the rice be cook , the top would be fine , but the bottom would be crusty and almost burnt and stick to the bottom . I finally get feed up and start look on Amazon for a replacement . I be pretty set on pick a Zojirushi model from all of the positive review I read on not only Amazon but other website as well . as I be browse , this Sanyo model catch my eye . it look pretty sleek with its metal face and top while the rest of the body be white . after read the review for it and compare the feature in a similarly price Zojirushi model , I decide to take the plunge and pick up the Sanyo . what a amazing little machine . the construction be solid , the bowl for the rice be heavy and well make . the unit have all kind of setting for the various type of rice . in addition , the unit come with another lid insert and another bowl to do slow cooking in the unit . it also come with a plastic insert that state it be for make tofu . not sure if I will ever use that , but I do like that I have the option . the rice it make be perfect , be not too mushy or too firm . the rice do not stick to the bottom of the bowl at all . it be just simply the best rice I ever make . as soon as the rice finish cooking , it switch over to a warming mode that state it can keep the rice warm for 12 hour . in addition , the rice can be place in the bowl with water in the morning and a timer set so that you have cook rice when you return from work . while the unit do chime when the rice be cook so that I be alert , when start the cycle , it do not give a estimate of the amount of time that it take to cook . however , that one minor drawback would not stop I from recommend this unit to anyone else look for a affordable unit to make perfect rice .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I pick the Sanyo ecj-hc55 base on the positive review on Amazon and because it come with a second bowl and lid . if you be look to use you rice cooker for more than just make rice , I strongly recommend this model , which cost about $ 10 more than the model with a single bowl . the second bowl allow you to make flavored rice dish , without leave any flavor behind to flavor you plain rice . both pot be very heavy , allow for very even cooking and no burning . cleanup be also very easy , due to the very effective , non-stick coating and the easily removable lid . as with most rice cooker in this category and price point , it do a excellent job on rice . measure you rice with the include cup , give it a rinse , add water to the measure inside the `` rice '' bowl , select the appropriate program -lrb- white rice in regular , firm , and soft , brown rice , sushi rice , porridge , etc -rrb- and you be reward with perfect rice in about a hour . there be also a nice countdown timer for the last 10 minute . once the rice finish and move to the `` keep warm '' setting , you rice stay great for hour , nice and moist with perfect temperature . so far we have use this cooker for white and brown rice , as well as jambalaya , paellum , lemon rice and rice and sausage . you can saute vegetable right in the cooker , before add the rice , to make complete meal right in the cooker . just use the `` Quick Cook '' program to heat the cooker up immediately , saute you veggy , then add rice and liquid and reset to a normal program -lrb- white or brown rice -rrb- and the cooker do the rest .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I never review product , but with this , I just have to . I be a non-cook and purchase this for three simple thing . steel cut oatmeal , brown rice , and perfect hard cook egg . this rice cooker do not dissapoint . its easy to use . clean up be a snap . I will never have to throw out egg again , because of my fail cooking skill . it will only do a small serve of the steel cut oats . half a cup of oats and two cup of water on the porridge set overnight . a batch bigger than that and it will boil over . so if you need more oats than that the bigger model may be best . Quinoa come out perfect also , use the white rice setting and the measurement and direction on the quinoa bag\/box . just do not add more liquid than the highest white rice line in the bowl , again boilover issue . my only small wish , be that the end of cycle timer be a little louder , if you be not right there with it , you may not hear it . definately five star , I would rate it higher if I could .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Panasonic do they homework ! Perfect rice in 30 minute . no over-boil spillage . not worry about teflon . if that do not kill we , something else will . just wish i do not have to unplug it if i want to stop the " keep warm " feature . a old rice cooker have the ability to just push the " lever " up to power off . but i will not take a star away for that , ut i will probably want to in the future if i move the plug into a less desirable spot haha
RiceCooker	POS	4	all these great review ... I do not get it . I have try several way to try and make rice without success . whether its a half cup or a whole it take well over 1.5 hour to cook and I end up with moush . a few minute in the microwave come out so much better . I should have return it when I have the chance . 6\/23\/2010 Update . for those who have request I update my review ... yes I do use top quality rice and I do rinse it first , but what I have find be you need to play with the quantity of water inorder to make good rice . both the rice and Zojirushi say to use a 1:1 ratio of water and rice , but I have find it need to be closer to 1.25:1 water to rice . now that I have find the correct ratio it do cook rice well ... I just wish it be quicker than a hour and a half .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the best rice cooker i have ever own . its easy to use and make wonderful rice . I make steel cut oats every morning and brown rice every night . I just set it at night and its ready for breakfast and then put brown rice in and set it for when I get home from work . I would highly recommend this rice cooker if you a rice `` expert '' and appreciate the taste and texture of well cook rice . BEST KITCHEN APPLIANCE EVER .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	update 12\/10 : I have have this cooker for a year now and be ready to pass it on and get a better one . initially I think it be fine , but I be tired of pot of rice with a crust at the bottom or hard-ish grain . this cooker be basically a hot plate . like the Scarecrow : it have no brain . it do not sense you rice , and it do not make any adjustment . the fancier and more expensive pot do . I be glad I have it for a year , so I could realize that I like have a rice cooker , and I 'll be glad when this one be go and I have a better one . original review : I be not give this rice cooker 5 star because I just can not get \* that \* excite about it . hey , it be just a rice cooker . but it do exactly what it be suppose to do and do it reliably . it be a great size for my family of 2 adult and 2 child , although , like other I be pretty surprise when I see how small the bowl be . to answer some specific concern of reviewer : the rice do not stick in the least , and I have not have it get brown and crusty on the bottom ; I have not have any problem with a starchy mess come out the steam hole ; brown rice need a bit more water -lrb- as it say in the instruction -rrb- and come out just fine . the instruction say that the cooker will take between 20 minute for a small amount of white rice to 60 minute for the largest amount of brown rice . I make a full pot of short-grain brown rice just last night , and I be sure that it do not take 60 minute . in addition , once cooking be complete , the cooker automatically switch to a warm cycle , and the rice can be hold in this way for up to 5 hour .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love the black and Decker Rice Cooker . it be perfect size and easy useage be the reason why I make a second purchase of this item . it would make a great gift for a college student or a wedding gift for sure . the seller provide excellent service .
RiceCooker	POS	5	it do great rice , that be probably be cover in other review . it also do steel cut oats , with 3:1 water ratio on the porridge setting . the timer function allow you to set the time that it finish cooking , so oatmeal can be ready when you wake up . you can even put the cooker on high and toast the oats in butter before you add water . it also do lentil curry . same porridge setting , delicious result . quinoa with frozen vegetable can be do with the quick cook setting . add some broth or bullion cube for much-needed flavor . so there you have it . it be pretty versatile , once you learn how to use it , creativity will get you far .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I like to look at review so I provide they . this rice cooker be amazing . when the rice cook you just walk away and do . you rice be ready . Pretty easy to clean . Make you you pay attention to the rice measurement and steam veggy , it do a great job as well .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I do a lot of research prior to choose the Zojirushi rice cooker and luckily for I by the time I be ready to purchase the company have come out with this model ns-vgc05 which be very compact and perfect for one person or even two . it do a amazing job of cook the rice to perfection . the instruction be easy to follow especially for be a novice . I be anxious to try the different setting for different rice and cake . I call the company to find out about the build in clock . the instruction do not explain whether you have to have the unit plug in to recharge the clock . the answer be that you do not have to have it plug in . it be a lithium battery that have a 5-6 year life and then you would call the company directly to have it replace . the clean up be really easy again by follow the instruction . I highly recommend this product . it be definitely worth the money pay !!!
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I do not like thing that require lot of clean up after . I buy this so I could have rice cooking and not have to pay much attention to it if I be interrupt by kid etc. . first time use , I do 1 cup measure of brown rice use the enclosed cup , and fill to the 1 mark line for water on the pot per the instruction . click cook and go about cook the rest of my meal . 10 minute later and there be splattering of starchy water out of the little vent hole in the lid . everywhere - for a 1 foot radius around the entire cooker . I unplug it , clean it up , start again with only a half cup measure of rice , and water to the appropriate line . same thing . Splatter everywhere . this time I have a towel underneath it and let the rice finish cooking . it be perfectly cook at least . I then attempt steel cut oatmeal overnight use the warm function . that do not splatter and make for creamy wonderful oatmeal first thing in the morning . right now I be do a 1\/4 cup measure of barley with water to the 1\/2 mark line -lrb- since barley require a little more water than rice -rrb- . it be splatter on Cook . I think this will be delegate to only oatmeal or other hot cereal on warm . the Cook function cause the boil-over or splattering and therefore clean up . not sure if I 'll be try another rice cooker .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have have my Sanyo cooker for just over a week now and have use it just 3 time . must say that the first 2 cup of rice be cook to perfection . no overcooked bottom in this little beauty . . second batch just like the first . . try the delay time and it go just great . just the fact that it cook to perfection and then keep it warm all night for rice cereal in the morning make this a winner in my book . Hope it hold up for many year . . my old rice cooker be now retire after 10 year of service . . I be just tire of the crusty bottom layer of rice ...
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be very pleased with this product . I do all that I need . Great for one person and the rice be perferctly cook
RiceCooker	POS	5	very good cooker better than one I use to have that last a few month . so far this one have be very good , great buy , ty amazon
RiceCooker	POS	5	the cooker work rather well . I think because it be so cheap that it might not work well . it do the job and it be easy clean up because the lid and the rice pan come right off . some cooker have the lid attach and they be more difficult to clean .
