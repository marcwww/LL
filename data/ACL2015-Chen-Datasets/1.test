I pay they on the 1st of May 2006 and my first copy be suppose to be the July issue -lrb- which have not yet turn up -rrb- , on write to they I get a response say that I should expect it any day , well I buy they word for it , but it never reach I . it be the same story for every issue and everytime I would write to they , all that they have to say be that I should reconfirm my postal address -lrb- which be ridiculous cause I have be get they renewal notice before even a single issue reach I , and I have bring that to they notice -rrb- . I even ask they for the detail of shippment so that I could trace my subscription , to which I be inform that it have be ship by surface mail -lrb- which be ridiculous cause I have pay they for international shipping -rrb- , well then I finally ask they to courier the subscription to I for a additional cost atleast I would get my magazine , well they do just that and I have my September issue in 2 day -lrb- all this after countless mail try to prove that I be a genuine subscriber and that my intention be as clear as un-polluted rain-water -rrb- . well then I wait anxiously for the next issue , which have not yet turn up and when I loge into my account on they site it show that my November issue have also be ship -lrb- they resort to surface shipping -rrb- ; well as you can guess I have to re-request they to resort to air shipping but now it seem like they have stop acknowledge my mail ; and I keep mail they in the hope that I 'll get what be mine but to no response . so for $ 40 I have just recieve my Sepetember issue -lrb- after countless mail request for something that I have pay for -rrb- and yes renewal notice by post : d -lrb- which be ridiculous -rrb- so my suggestion to people who want to subscribe to this magazine anywhere outside America would be to rethink bout it or if they get kick out of request for something that be theirs , well then you should subscribe to Acoustic Guitar .

I could not resist . and I think that I may even order a subscription because Cowboys and Indians hold a great interest for I . I love everything to do with they . the feature article on the Duke be great , and I enjoy read it very much , but there be not too much else about this publication that would make I want to put out the money to receive it on a regular basis . the magazine be pretentious and gear toward those cowboy and gal who may be live in Beverly Hills . the page be nearly cover to cover advertisement for high style and high price goods range from land to furniture , artwork , jewelry and clothing . there be a few article , poem and story between all the schmaltz . in this issue I be interested in one about a french cowboy actor Jean `` Joe '' Hamman -lrb- 1885 - 1974 -rrb- dub the `` french John Wayne '' . I also find some great western recipe and gardening tip . when I see a article title ` Hi-Ho Silver '' , I get excite think it would at least be something have to do with `` the Lone Ranger '' , but of course it be page and page of high price jewlery . for the most part , this high quality magazine do not give I much on real cowboy . and there be almost nothing on the ` indian '' part of the title . aside from some beautiful look sculpture -lrb- and a small blurb -rrb- , one that probably be worth more then my car -lrb- I be not sure how much it cost because you have to call a number to find out -rrb- , there be not much on they at all . it be probably worth a view once or twice a year for those interested in upcome event and art fair , etc , as there be calendar with the various event . and even there , I do not see any pow-wow list . but I would not recommend a subscription if you be look for some substantial read of `` Cowboys and Indians '' happy trail ...

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	this magazine be order on June 30th , my Son have not recieve it yet ???????? so can not comment on a review at this time .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	I buy it for my wife and she seem to like it though I be not sure whether or not she read through all the text may be she just focus on the picture to get a idea of current fashion trend to give she some guidance in shopping .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	a old favorite with adul and kid - informative , amazing picture , fact and a eye opener to the world we live in ! these be good for project , reference , and many other research source ... . a real life mag . . that spark question and interest - a teaching tool , not a cute home decor manual !
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I order the Vogue on 7\/17 , and today be 8\/29 , I still have not receive it . I order two magazine at the same time , get another one one week ago .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	I end my subscription a couple of year ago with agm , String Publishing . they make I a very good offer on a renewal , which I accept . after 4 month I still do not receive a magazine ! I contact customer service , and some dope name Cassandra completely drop the ball , claim she could not view a copy of the cash check , and when I finally threaten with the BBB , she claim I pay for they online service . completely untrue . by the way , it take 2 month of email for she to reach this decision . I email the maagazine editor in a attempt to bypass the dope . I 'll give they another couple of day and then it be off to the Better Business Bureau or the local DA if I can not get anything do through the BBB . the real problem here be that this be the second time they do it to I . shame on I !
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	Cowboys & Indians magazine be a beautiful magazine from start to finish . interesting editorial , photography that will take you breath away , and new fashion , music & art - all of which truly express the culture of the West . regardless of whether or not you be a `` cowboy '' or a `` indian '' , this be one magazine subscription you must have - you will not be disappointed !
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I order this subscription in December -lrb- in time for snowmobile season -rrb- . I be tell I would not see a magazine until April . make no sense to I . why do i want to read about snowmobile after winter be over ?
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I purchase this subscription as a gift for my parent . both be enjoy the magazine so much ! it be the perfect gift !
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	Great Magazine , always full of varied and interestring topic mostly under a `` scientific '' or `` nature '' theme . awesome photo . Educational and interesting read . highly recomend it to everyone !
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I be subscribe to j-14 and it be one of my favorite . my favorite part of it be the hair section , page 50 , and the lyric page .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	while I do enjoy the article that be in this magazine -lrb- they be always well do , professional , and cover a variety of issue -rrb- , I feel that there be not enough material in the magazine to warrant the cost of approximately $ 4 per issue . the magazine be very thin and only come out 6 time a year . I feel that that they need to either bulk up the magazine or offer it more frequently if they want to continue to charge the same amount . it be unlikely that I will renew my subscription and this be almost exclusively due to the cost .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I like the magazine , but not the Kindle HD version . I already have a subscription so I decide to try the Kindle HD version , I kid you not it be be download for the last three hour ! I be glad I try it before order the O magazine which be also a larger content magazine . if you have a lot of time for a download and battery recharge go for it , if not it be a bust .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	if you want a vogue subscription I suggest go to the Vogue website and order from they . my magazine arrive with a tear cover , warped page , and basically look like garbage . Fine . thing happen during shipping and I understand that . I have send they a polite request for another unblemished copy and have yet to receive a response . upon receipt of a pristine copy of the October 2011 issue , I will happily delete this review . until then , I recommend not buy from this seller .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	interview be quite possibly the best magazine in term of nag-for-your-quality-for-your-buck-for-your-time for fashion photographer , or any in the fashion industry .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I remember have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC as a kid and be mostly impressed with the picture . now , order it myself year later , I know that my memory serve I correctly - oh those picture ! whether they be picture of the human heart or unearthly undersea worm in Hawaii -lrb- February issue -rrb- or elephant herd or cosmic star -lrb- March issue -rrb- NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 's picture be absolutely outstanding . and the map ! I love those map as a kid ! note , I have not receive a fold out map yet , so I be eagerly await my first one . -lrb- I be debate whether I should decorate my wall with they -rrb- . but even those within the magazine itself be fantastic : they be clear , and give a wealth of information . the January issue have a clear map on the Amazon , which include area of forest , area of deforestation , area of urbanization , forest fire , road , protect area and area with indigenous community . now as a adult , I actually read the article , and not just flip through the picture and gaze at the map . other reviewer be correct , the article have a ` chatty tone ' and be definitely for laypeople , but this be not a bad thing . in fact , I find it refreshing after spend all my time at work now and at formerly at school reading jargon . after all , who be a expert on the human heart , the Amazon , elephant herd , undersea worm , cosmic star , nigerian oil , and hummingbird all at once ? and these be simply some of the story cover in the January , February and March 2007 issue ! NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC introduce a whole host of subject in a intelligent , thoughtful fashion : its not mean to be a Ph. D dissertation on these subject . it enlighten we to the amazing thing -lrb- both wonderful and horrible -rrb- go on in we world . if we want to delve further , we can always pick up a scholarly journal or a Ph. D thesis ... -lrb- ... -rrb-
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEU	3	this Chicago magazine subscription be a christmas present . the magazine be o.k. , but usually end up in the garbage . there be too many ad and not enough information on the `` real '' chicago . I do like some of they article , but again , usually , it end up in the garbage .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	yes , I be a fashionista & this be supposedly the bible of the fashion industry ! however , I find this magazine to be really dull . it have too many page , too many advertisement & they show nothing but the most expensive designer clothes worn by the usual anorexic stick figure model who really need to eat ! the article be also very boring . they write about alot of really rich sociallite & high-society lifestyle . there be really nothing in this magazine I can use that relate to I . you would have to be Paris Hilton to be entertain by this publication . if I want a great fashion magazine , I get ELLE because at least the clothing they show be a liitle more affordable & they have some great article !
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEU	3	National Geographic be a great magazine , but after purchase it through Amazon because of a discount they give I , they inexplicably cancel the transaction claim something go wrong . they ask I to reorder , but I be not sure I want to go through the hassle .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	my nephew , who just turn 15 , have be get it for a year and want it renew ! so , he be now get it for a second year .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	the Weekly Standard be where the advocate of militarism and corporatism share the thought cobble together by various industry lawyer , think tank , and pr agent  pr ! - a Social history of spin  it be regularly promote through other avenue of right-wing cultism , like the Limbaugh show and all the little Limbaughs  Echo Chamber : Rush Limbaugh and the conservative Media establishment  like any propaganda , it should be monitor to see how the spin doctor of the right-wing establishment be deceive those who subscribe to the value of elitism , imperialism , and other ugly aspect of the american empire  kill Hope : U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions since World War II-Updated through 2003  for people who be interested in the real world , I would recommend :  the conservative Nanny State : how the Wealthy Use the government to Stay Rich and get richer
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	get this mag 4 my daughter , she love it . lot of article and pic of the `` hot '' people of 2day .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	by far the best photographic magazine on the planet ... a must have for any world traveler or photo junkie . a beautiful magazine .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	this magazine be fill with ad and the article be rarely very interesting -lrb- unless you make million -rrb- . not worth my precious time !
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	here be a magazine that focus on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that make a competitor like `` Wallpaper '' a expensive , hit-or-miss read . what I like most about `` Dwell '' be its consistency in present interesting design from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time . even the advertisement be quite compatible to the flow of the magazine , so much so that they often look like they be part of the editorial . there be a very useful `` Marketplace '' section at the end that tell you where to get a lot of the art , furniture and accessory complementary to the design present . I have often use these helpful listing to find some interesting thing for my own place . this magazine be definitely gear toward the urban loft dweller , but I like how they highlight home with family in mind as well . individual issue be often focus on either geographic or utility-related theme , thus keep a library mandatory for future reference . the photography be superb . if you be tire of design magazine that seem to be talk specifically to designer , this be a great , reasonably price alternative for people who simply appreciate great design . highly recommend .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	my husband love this magazine and read it cover to cover then be send to my son who do the same
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	with the size and appearance of a slimmed-down reader 's DIGEST , the less famous BIRD WATCHER 's DIGEST be a chirpy little optimist of a magazine not so very different from , say , a black-capped chickadee . short and moderate-sized article cover specific species , how-to\/techniques , choose the right birding equipment , and joy-of-birding anecdote . advertisement abound but do not overwhelm . some be quite helpful . bwd be a perky standard for birder both casual and serious .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	for those of you say $ 15 for a subscripiton on the National Geographic site . go buy it , you will be very dissapointed when you get only one magazine . . ITS NOT A SUBSCRIPTION , BUT A SINGLE MAGAZINE . . for one , do you really think they would sell they that cheap , everything else they sell be expensive . for two , it clearley state that you get one magazine , one time .

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	CHILE PEPPER be one of the more interesting cooking magazine out there . the recipe tend to emphasize Cajun , Creole , and Carribean style . not all of the recipe include chile pepper or have a great deal of heat , but most recipe would likely appeal to chilehead . have grow up in the Southwest , I love these type of recipe and have make several with excellent result . the story be also interesting , focus on restaurant and manufacturer involve in the chile pepper businesss , such as the folk at Tabasco . there be also many story on various hot sauce . recommend for people look for something a little different or who like Lousiana or hot food .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I have buy the subscription of this magazine on and off throughout the year and always seem to come back to it . the photographer be some of the most amazing photo-journalist on the planet and go to a ton of really neat location . they will brave almost anything to get the photograph for we enjoyment . the article be well scop out for the reader and make you want to jump on the next jet to get there to see for yourself . you can not go wrong with this magazine , folk .

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I do live in Chicago , so my viewpoint may be different than that of someone who do not live here and probably only come here once a month .  i subscribe to this magazine 2 year ago , before the Tribune Co. buy it . it have several great article each month and be really relevant not only to people live in Chicago , but to those who have just move here . I still have several of those because they be so good to have .  some of my favorite , and headlining , article include : Chicago 's best new restaurant -lrb- May 2001 -rrb- , Chicago 's Guide to Summer -lrb- May 2001 -rrb- , 25 Weekend Getaways -lrb- June 2001 -rrb- , Guide to survive O'Hare -lrb- Feb. 2001 -rrb-  when I resubscribe 6 month ago -lrb- post Tribune buy out -rrb- I start to notice it be cater to a different set of people . it now at least seem to have a lot less article and they be a lot more relevant to people who live in the suburb , or be Chicago old-money . definitely cater to the 50 + crowd now .  from the Jan. 2003 edition : Chicago 's top doctor , from the Dec. 2002 edition : the most expensive thing in town , and look at this month 's highlight ` Chicago 's richest people ' . . why do I care ? I do not !!  i will not be renew my subscription to this formerly good magazine .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	let 's be honest here ... 50 $ be way too much for a cute little sundress for I . I love fashion , Vogue , and all that stuff , but I be never go to buy clothes like that -lrb- or even wear they , give my southern small-town culture -rrb- . I still love Vogue , because of the photography , and ad . I like make collage , and tear out photo that be cool look . I have subscribe for half a year , and I have yet to read a article ... who need it when you have those tempting glossy page full of photo-shopped model that do not look a thing like that in reality ? get it anyway ... no other fashion magazine compare
