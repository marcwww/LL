Movies_TV	POS	5	in my view this be the single best season of Dr. who . I know that be say a lot - and I know a lot of people would disagree with I . it be pointless to say all the story in Series 2 be great - because virtually all Dr. who episode from all the season be great . I think , more than anything else , it be the character of Rose Tyler that put this season over the top . she be great in Series 1 ; but she be almost sublime in Series 2 . plus , this season contain the single most poignant story in the entire Dr. who repetoire . though I agree with Colin Baker , who reportedly say that `` the empty child '' -lrb- from Series 1 -rrb- be just about the best Dr. who episode ; to I `` the Girl in the fireplace '' from Series 2 be the most poignant . it be far from the best Dr. who ; the alien menace be almost comical in the way that some of the alien from the earliest Dr. who episode be ; and the story line do seem stretch a bit . but there be something so almost magical about the episode , and so unexpectedly sad about the end . you get the feeling that if Dr. who could have choose a true soul-mate from among all the woman he have ever encounter , it would have be this `` Girl in the fireplace . '' and the two-part episode `` the Satan pit '' show the depth of the bond between the doctor and Rose more succinctly than any other episode ; he be willing to place he life entirely in she hand - that be how much he be come to trust she instinct for do the right thing . then the season finale , another two-part episode , bring they relationship full circle . it , too , be one of the most poignant Doctor who episode - and one of the most innovative , pit two of the Doctor 's greatest enemy against themselves as well as against the world . all in all , this season be nearly perfect .
Movies_TV	POS	4	this be one of the best movie Disney have ever make . the reason I give it four star be because the woman be make as the enemy in this film . but as a child that do not matter . you child will love dream that neverland really exsist . I highly reccommend buy this movie for you child .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	my kid love this movie and I highly recommend it . where I find fault be with the dvd itself and the Disney Corporation . twice now , when insert into a computer it have completely screw thing up . first , on my laptop for which a system restore be able to fix and the cause be blame on the anti-piracy software that automatically run . the second time , when my daughter insert the disk into my neighbor desktop computer and the Geek Squad after many hour end up have to ` wipe the hard drive ' and re-install everything . again , the cause be blame on ` anti-piracy protection ' . so , the movie be great ... just be cautious before you watch it on a computer .

Movies_TV	NEU	3	I have not previously watch or even be interested in a straight-to-dvd Disney sequel , but for some reason I pick this up , and think it sound quite cool , kinda have a back to the future ring to it . I put it back , think it would just be as bad as the review for other ` classic ' would be , but my mum remembered , and buy it for my birthday . -lrb- early twenty and I still love Disney movie ! -rrb- I be pleasantly surprised , as with most straight to dvd sequel , they be normally a carbon copy of the first , and in no way original . it feature many of the same familiar character , include the two mouse , my favorite ! albeit with different voice . it be a original storyline too , with change everything that happen in the very first , and make Cinderella fight for she prince charming . -lrb- do he ever get a name by the way ? -rrb- I do find the song be not as great as the original , but we would have guess that . they be not really memorable , but I can definitely remember the one from the first . just one wee quibble - do anyone else notice when the prince propose to anastacium , she actually put the ring on the wrong hand ?! it be suppose to be the fourth finger -lrb- if you count the thumb -rrb- of the left hand , not the right ! unlike many sequel , this will probably stand the test of time , and will definitely be one I show my kid , along with the other special edition I be collect - although by that time , dvd will probably be obsolete . but if you have hear bad review about other sequel , this be the one you should pick up . and adult will enjoy the suspenseful storyline too , even if it be predictable .

Movies_TV	POS	5	First Will Smith rock all-round . the movie really make you think about the lack of privacy in we world today . and make you wonder about the government and what role they play or do not play in we society . it be well write and act out . full of drama and suspense . scary , in a way because you do not know how far someone will go to get what they want . a must see , and worth every penny you spend .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I love this movie , as I do all the earlier Disney animation . I read the review by Carolinapooh , and I , too , remember that the part about clap to keep Tinkerbell alive be in the movie ! if you watch it , you will see Tinkerbell fading , and then there be a abrupt cut and suddenly she be ok . why would they have take it out ? maybe they think kid today be just too sophisticated for that , and sadly , they may be right .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I know alot of people hate the `` sequel '' Disney movie simply because they feel they creation `` desecrate '' the memory of the original . ah but do remember , these be never `` original '' Disney property to begin with , they be softer retelling of fairy tale or other classic novel . Cinderella III be a entertaining movie . it be animation be quite fluid , with a few mistake here and there , it be still a bright , vibrant movie with consistent character design . the storyline be a `` alternative '' storyboard , where the character be force back in time and down different path for the sake of the storyboard . this make thing interesting , and even the comedic bit be either slapstick , or subtle intelligent and amusing . the bottom line be that this be one of the best thing Disney have release in recent year ... they non-pixar cg movie have be terrible -lrb- `` Chicken Little '' almost unwatchable it be so bad -rrb- and not much else have come from the studio . anyone that love fairy tale , Cinderella , alternate timeline -lrb- a popular device in Sci Fi and fantasy -rrb- etc will enjoy this movie . my daughter be three and this be by far she favorite film right now -lrb- yes , even over `` classic '' like `` Cinderella one '' as she call it , etc -rrb- .
Movies_TV	POS	5	the second Seasons be great , the music , the story , and well the Girl in the Fireplace be a masterpiece !!! I hope the 10th doctor never regenerate !!!
Movies_TV	POS	5	this sequal be wonderful . the animation be excellent , though other may comment that it be not correct to the original style . I hate to be the one to point this out , but we be no longer in the 50 's decade . animation have come a long way since then , so of course it will look sharper . from a artist 's standpoint , there be such subtly and depth to each scene that , storyline aside , it be delightful to watch - especially character reaction . as for the story , it be clean -lrb- which be a rarety in and of itself -rrb- as well as entertaining . the plot take a fun twist on what would happen if the wand be in another 's hand and really try to prove that even without magical assistance , Cinderella could still hold she own . and be not that what the 50 's version be attempt to point out as well ? I do not think this movie detract from the original , but instead be a fun , relax form of entertainment . however , to be fair , the only part I find irritating be the change in the mouse 's diction . that be the only change that I find annoying enough to mention . that aside , it be nice to see a woman fight for she dream and get they - and a prince with a personality to boot ! so I would recommend this movie to those who just want a clean , fun , and intelligent source of entertainment for themselves as well as they child .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I find enemy of the State a well-written , well-acted movie . my family constantly discuss the casting , the plot , and the `` could this happen in we ` real ' life '' situation . this video stimulate we discussion about the influence of technology and government and the impact of technology in the hand of governmental department . it be a timely viewing consider the privacy bill that be now be discuss in Congress . this be a recommend video to watch with older child -lrb- 16 or older -rrb- .

Movies_TV	POS	5	definately one of the best spy movie I have see in a long time . from the murder at the start to the resturant scene at the end this be a great modern day spy story . whether you take the gadget seriousely or not be up to you , remember , it be just a movie . my only complaint be that Will Smith be way out of he league in this one , he just can not hold it in a serious movie . Hackman who do not appear until almost half way thru the movie steal the show and show what a class act he be . will smith should stick to the goofy part he have play before like MIB or wild wild west , not the serious movie the scenery and tech stuff be all well do and one worth owning , so buy this one
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be a great buy for I ! ive be look everywhere for Peter Pan but its in the Disney Vault ... not easy to explain to a 4 yr old !! it be a little pricey but well worth the money at the end of the day ! the seller be great ! she ship promptly and it arrive in the condition she say it be in . totally unopened !

Movies_TV	POS	4	I love fairy tale in all form , and I really do like Cinderella II . I be a bit worried about Cinderella III because my first impression be that Disney be just out to make more money . as I learn the premise for the movie , `` what if the fairy godmother have become incapacitated and the stepmother have the wand ? '' and it make I stop and say , `` okay , I have to see that movie . '' Disney develop the plot quite nicely . Everytime Cinderella triumph , the stepmother would one up she and I would still be wait for my happy ending . I like the anticipation . also , as many other reader have say , Cinderella have gut in this movie . she stand up to the stepmother and tell she `` hey lady quit rain on my parade ! '' this movie be a great sequel . it seem to stem from a provacative idea rather than Disney be out to disappoint we with a sub-par sequel -lrb- i.e. . the jungle book 2 -rrb- . Watch Cinderella III , it be a great movie for a rainy afternoon with you kid .

Movies_TV	POS	4	my husband could barely contain himself when he find out that he much beloved Dr. who be come back to town on the sci-fus channel back in 2005 . I have to admit that I be a bit excited myself . here be a chance to get reaquaint with the a little british sci-fus export about this painfully british look guy -lrb- Tom Baker , of course -rrb- with this forever long scarf lope about among cheap `` hi-tech '' set with this much younger british chick . I have only see a couple of episode as a very young child and find that it merely creep I out -lrb- I believe it be Robots of Death -rrb- , but I remember enough to relate when people mention the show , or when I would hear the theme music . so , here I be at 33 years-old ready to wipe the Dr. who slate clean and begin thing all anew for my husband 's enjoyment , if anything . the new series have be alot of fun . hear the theme music again , even to a non-fan be nostalgic enough to bring tear to the eye . the effect and studio set look great , the story exciting and clever . both doctor have be fun loving and just chock-full of all thing a sci-fi fan could possibly want , and prove once again that one do not have to be a `` kill em all and let God sort em out '' kind of hero to save the day in Whoville . so , I give this series a nice , healthy rating . room for it to shoot for perfection , not that it have far to go . that be say ... after watch `` School Reunion '' with Elizabeth Sladen reprise she role as Sarah Jane Smith with faithful computer dog k-9 , it make I wonder about the whole Dr. who phenomenon in general . my husband fill I in on the fact that this show have be on for 26 consecutive year from 1963-1989 and that there have be more doctor before and after scarf dude . so , out of curiosity , I start dabble into classic Dr. who mostly from the 70 's be that this period more coinside with the little I remember about the show , and the fact that more dvd be available from this era . since then I have see the light . true , the effect and set be still pretty poor , and the creature costume rather embarrassing , the script a bit forced , but it do accomplish one very important aspect of Dr. who . it last out 26 year through the blood , sweat , and tear of those man and woman in front and behind the camera . there be no computer artist to type in a program to bring all those monster closer to life . many script be write up in a week 's time or less . the film be fast and furious , often require the actor to get it right the first time , because studio time be a precious and expensive commodity . all this to fill up a half hour every Saturday for British kid , and somehow , it still become a worldwide obsession . okay , enough of the soap-box talk and on to personal opinion of these new doctor . now , mind you , I like these guy , just as I mention before , and if these be the absolute first to play the role , it would be a no-brainer to say that they be dead-on . but they be not the absolute first and in some way there be a lot to be desire . they do a great job take on bit and piece of the doctor they generate from , but I find Eccleston 's heavy northern accent rather jolting . he remind I of drax from the Armaggedan factor episode from 1978 with that accent , and I would rather not be remind of Drax manifest in any doctor regeneration ! and as for little David Tennant , well , I refer to he as a little , oily rat in another review , but only because I have only see he in he role in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and he do such a great job as a little , oily rat man -lrb- other than wormtail , of course -rrb- ! he be also rather too young look to play this 900 year-old Timelord . at he age he have to be careful not to come off a some arrogant , know-it-all brat . and as for companion Rose and all she baggage -lrb- I mean ` family ' -rrb- , I do not recall Tom Baker 's doctor ever care whether he have a companion or not . he most certainly never beg they to come along , they be sort of always dump on he to haul around . these be personal opinion , of course , and if northern british accent and kid look timelord be you cup of tea , hey , this new series be perfection already . but if you can not help but long for the bohemian dress , scarf wearin ' , alien charm of Tom Baker lope about those cheap , build from scratch set , ad-libbing Oscar Wilde style in he smooth baratone voice , then slap 4 star on this series and remember to be eternally grateful that it bring you back to try and true , bare knuckle who .

Series 2 have preserve the spirit of classic dw while take a bold step into the future -lrb- no pun intend -rrb- , and story arc like ` rise of the Cybermen ' \/ ` age of Steel ' and the season finale will not disappoint . ` the idiot 's Lantern ' could have be from season 24-26 . ` School Reunion ' and ` Tooth and Claw ' be also excellent . simply put , there be not one single story I do not like . my highest recommendation , need to be 10 star !

Movies_TV	POS	5	after the astounding climax to the first season , I find it hard to believe that this strong debut would ever be top . the Christmas special blow those doubt apart , as well as set the tone -lrb- and some plotpoint -rrb- for the rest of the season . this episode be one of the most unusual in the show 's history , as the doctor be incommunicado for almost three-quarter of its run time . the payoff be huge , with the best debut of a doctor that I have ever see . there be so many great moment in those fifteen minute . see the doctor work out who he be . the swordfight . six word . Russell T. Davies really stamp he mark on the series with this episode . the succeed episode all , arguably , vary in quality depend on how high you standard be . the most annoying aspect be the inclusion of Torchwood - which on reflection be not as subtle as the ` bad Wolf ' meme from last season . for I , the standout be the perfect three episode run - tooth and claw -lrb- Russell T. Davies -rrb- , School Reunion -lrb- Toby Whithouse -rrb- and the absolutely superb and near-perfect Girl in the fireplace -lrb- from the brilliant Steven Moffat -rrb- . all , for I , perfect Doctor who episode and also great example of the different tone and theme that the series have explore throughout its long history . New series fan may be perturb that Rose get less to do this season . it be clear , in retrospect , that the focus be on create story for the new doctor . while Rose 's backstory run as a subplot in the background . in retrospect this be understandable , but be rather jarring on initial transmission . especially as Russell 's plan for this season be not entirely clear from the first few episode . the dvd extra be as great as ever . in addition to the Confidential Cut-Downs , there be also the dvd commentary . Dissapointingly , Steven Moffat do not get a turn this time round , although he do provide commentary in a podcast freely available on the BBC 's Dr who website . however Russell T. Davies do commentate on Tooth and Claw , and be wonderfully entertaining and informative . it be also incredibly please to see the new doctor - David Tennant - make a big contribution to the dvd as well . he contribute commentary to three episode -lrb- School Reunion , Idiots Lantern , Doomsday -rrb- . and also provide a whopping 85-minute video diary that cover the entire season . it be a suprisingly frank documentary , show David 's initial nervousness at both live up to the Legacy he so clearly idolise , and cope with the hectic schedule that seem to be the hallmark of this new series . big kudos to Tennant for provide such a generous look at what it take to be the very best in this fantastic series . in addition to be one of the best doctor 's ever , he be also a great Ambassador for the show . look back on it , the second series be much much better than the already strong first season . whether or not you enjoy it depend on whether or not you accept David Tennant as the doctor . and whether you can accept that this new series flatly refuse to conform to fan expectation of what a science fiction should be . this be Doctor who as big-budget Family Entertainment . in my case , the answer be a resounding yes . this second series have help in lay a strong foundation for what be undoubtedly the greatest run this much-loved series have ever have . if I could , I would give this 10 star out of 5 . more please !
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have love this movie ever since I see it on the Disneyland tv show in the early 1950 's . it absolutely enthral I . the masterful animation , the fascinating story and the uplifting music go a long way in make the delicious fantasy almost seem true . as in all good , juicy story , character give each other a rough time . Captain Hook stalk Peter Pan and even give he a deadly bomb ! Peter Pan also taunt the good captain . the crocodile also do he best to make Captain Hook 's life a misery . funny how the pc police never bring up these male-on-male confrontation . but once Tinkerbell get jealous of wendy , or the mermaid act uppity , then we be deal with female-on-female bullying , and that do not go over with the lady nowadays . never mind that it be a fact of life . as for the caricatured native american stereotype , that be all they be . unhappily , a lot of caricature be exaggerated image which have grow up around a kernel of truth . and they apply to all race . as a white male , my biggest nightmare be that I may someday actually look like Homer Simpson , Elmer Fudd or Popeye . but I 'll just have to take my chance . kid be very sensitive to the energy around they , and if you sit there watch Disney 's Peter Pan with they in a guard , pc resistance-stance , they 'll tune right into it and then get turn off . why not lighten up , and take this film on its own wonderful fantasy term ? that positive energy will enhance the experience for you little one . if ever a film be make for child , this be one of the best .

Movies_TV	NEU	3	I have be make a point of re-watching all the Disney classic from my youth and comment on they with adult eye . it be be a very interesting experience , and PETER PAN be no exception .  what stand out be all the element Disney would not dare put in a animated film today ... like the carefree knife play and the pirate who Captian Hook pick off with he hand gun . but by and large , the whole fire engine red face `` injun '' scene be pretty amazing . prune-faced and hook-nosed , the red man hit every stereotype in the book ... and it just go on and on .  while we be all familiar with the story of PETER PAN , I have no recollection the whole thing be essentially motivate by jealous female . Tinkerbell be jealous of wendy . the mermaid be jealous of wendy . wendy be jealous of Tigerlily . jealous Tinkerbell sell Peter out -lrb- at least Tigerlily be smart enough to keep she mouth shut -rrb- . all be vie for Peter 's attention , and he be near oblivious to the lot of it .  and Peter , in my opinion , be kind of a unlikable jerk -lrb- along with the retard lose boy -rrb- . a wise-guy , who pout and listen to no one , he turn on he best friend , Tinkerbell , and banish she forever , make the effort to reconcile only when he think she be about to die . at one point , I be kind of hope Captian Hook would at least get one good shot in .  it be a all right piece of animation , better than SNOW WHITE and far better than ALICE in WONDERLAND ... but not nearly as good as JUNGLE BOOK , which be by far my Disney favorite . PETER PAN land somewhere between SNOW WHITE and ROBIN HOOD on my scale . with the most enjoyable part involve the hungry crocodile or wendy 's littlest brother -lrb- who be really cute -rrb- .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I have my heart set on loathing David Tenant as the new doctor after Christopher Eccleston 's departure in the final episode of the previous series . there be just no way that he could replace Eccleston ! no way ! I be prove wrong a thousand time over . Tennant become more and more of a pleasure throughout Series 2 and then 3 and 4 . the team , Billie Piper as Rose and Tennant as the Doctor , in this second series be a incredible , unstoppable combination . do the special effect get better or do I finally learn to look past they and see the rich depth the show offer in spite of they ?
Movies_TV	NEG	2	a simple question . all write should really be critique by modern script editor and writer , even producer , by five basic question - who ? where ? what ? how ? why ? sadly these very basic question be not bring into play when show like this be make . much of modern television writing be very sad , but the effort tend to survive via hungry , lethargic audience in need of escapism that find delight in sexual content , glossy effect , and kitschy but vapid symbolism\/content . all story base entertainment have to have strong story to be excellent , and this be really , really , really awful scripting . that be say , I do want to say that Tennant be probably the best doctor since Tom Baker , and if he can refine the character a little and cut out some of the hectoring speech and slobber he might be the television character of the decade . the production value of the new series -lrb- aside from write -rrb- be brilliant ! but many of the actor can not shine because the scripting be so limited and flabby to center on glitz rather then character - a shame since so many british actor be brilliant at make greater then life , enigmatic and memorable performance when give good script and direction . Davies seem to have a penchant for the hilarity that be put the ` doctor ' in HOSPITALS . har har , such a great joke , especially to kick off a new doctor . 90 % of the season deteriorate into logicless monster and motive . awful denouement tend to involve the Davies signature machina-ex-due with a super magic wand sonic screwdriver . cop out galore ! and if that isn ; t enough , you get a surprise oral sex gag for the kiddie , and a slew of black tie party , east ender , and sappy sexual situation that take the place of the base instinct of survival and greed that make the series able to continue through the decade . if write reflect a writer , then the writer -lrb- s -rrb- basically portray that they be all about sex , party , hook up , sappy sentimentality , and random political struggle within corporation . nice . the shine star of this season , stand head , shoulder , chest , abdomen , groin and thigh above the surround effort in ` Girl in the fireplace ' write by Steven Moffat -lrb- creator\/writer of the brilliant coupling sitcom -rrb- . while this be a story of twisted survival it be also about emotional love and devotion ; a unusual Doctor who aspect unexplored until now , especially swamp in lust the rest of the season . the doctor become a enigmatic and valiant ` prince ' that unexpectedly -lrb- but extremely well write -rrb- create devotion in a unusual ` princess ' . but then the logic of the story go to hell in the denouement as it become another silly ` doctor rant at lethal enemy that stand there and take it on the chin while stand still as a statue ' moment common in this season . that be vindicate by the final twist reveal the motive of the story . the `` New Adventures of Doctor who : EastEnders lose in space '' be a grab bag . if you be a kid who need a new shiny with some lust and casual love throw in - it be perfect . if you be a intelligent viewer who want great story , perhaps something to reaffirm life 's glory and myriad wonder ... walk on by , or sob like a little girl over the money waste on ephemeral garbage . personally i find this season , and almost all new who story , rather intellectually insulting and simplistic . if only the crew ask - why ? - from the start . they would have find they do it for the money and fame , and just write show about money and fame . and we would have at least have story that honestly express they soul , rather then a combo of fan pandering image and situation string together with screech , simplistic dialogue .

Movies_TV	POS	5	this movie I believe be something most of we only wish could have be make . who do not want to see Cinderella maybe lose she happily ever after ? in the first movie she always seem to do she work with a sarcastic tone . she could not even get up out of bed , some maid !! I think this movie might be a little scary for some kid because the stepmother be really wicked this time . she break Cinderella 's slipper and then tell she to go `` clean it up '' . the best part be when the step mother use magic to trap Cinderella inside a pumpkin , and not that fancy coach this be inside with he seed and thorn grow all around it and Cinderella 's dress be all rip . Haha and Cinderella be so silly when she go `` but I dance with the prince '' and the stepmother just laugh at she ! also what really be amazing be that there be almost a unspoken theme in the movie the the King and Anastasia fall in love , if you have see this movie you know what I be talk about !! could this be a clue to a possible Cinderella 4 ?? Anastasia as Queen lol you decide !!
Movies_TV	POS	4	like many other thousand of people I be a huge fan of Disney animated classic so I be very happy that this edition of Peter Pan be available .

Movies_TV	NEG	1	\*\*\* spoilder \*\*\* below warning . it start off with cinderellum 's foot which do not look the same as in the original movie , kind of disgust in my opinion . when she talk about herself , blah blah , it be just not cinderellish , she be full of herself !!!!!!!!!! Prince do not look the same , he neck be too fat and it seem he skin tone change it almost every scene . they speech be too `` modern '' and annoying , do not give it a authentic feel at all . the step sister be WAY TOO GOOFY , unrealistic , I mean they can hardly walk two step without flop over , too silly . Anastasia be way too stupid and she be apologize for every little thing she do , it just do not make any sense , in the first movie they be all equally rude , even as child they be selfish little brat and now she just look like a big goof ! the step mother be always mean but here the part when she get the wand be go overboard , it be like she be a villian or witch ... too much drama in that part `` call on all the force of the universe ??! '' duh . Anastasia 's foot be HUGE , and then she kiss it and jump around the room , this be go overboard , a girl in that era would not act this way at ALLLLLLL !! Cinderella 's comment after she step mother leave be just weird , and then that uncatchy song and run out into the field . very uncreative and dramatic , these tune be all so similar in all the disney movie today and so annoying !! at the palace : how on earth do she get to the palace before the rest arrive ??? the prince work out with he father in the `` pink '' gym and you would think he be a circus boy after perfome those high rise stunt , never would have expect that from he . the part when prince charming have to apologize to they sound so cheap , he enter the room and it be like he do not notice the girl ISN `` t cinderellum . . and how anastasium introduce herself as a jerkess then it turn into a bit of a circus after he propose . the whole `` spell thing '' be just like in the little mermaide . if you look closely she put the ring on the left hand then admire it and it be on she right hand . Cinderella finally find the prince : it be like she be make a fool of herself , she little giggle and she sound EXACTLY like the princess May from Mulan , terrible . the head maid drag cinderellum away look so degrading , the whole `` meeting '' be cheesy . now when the step mother and sister be show into the room with the large cake this scene be a absoloutely rediculous !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what a mess when the king meet the bride-to-be who be in a aweful disgusting state . unbelievable ! now Anastasia and the prince practice dancing , why on earth do she have to wear she `` one '' glass slipper ??? the step mother seem to have so much influence in the palance once she `` move in '' when the king give the queen shell to anastasia he sound like a old indian chief or something , the voice just do not seem to fit the part . `` I dooooooooo '' practice by anastasium be TOO MUCH , and I wonder why she have such a nice singing voice , do not seem to go together , plus suddenly she can dance so gracefully . . remember the first movie when the two sister practice singing '' sing sweet nightangale '' they sound AWEFUL so what bring such a change ? so unrealistic . Cinderella struggle to say the magic word once she have the wand in she hand , stupid !!! Prince 's reaction after hear the true story from the mouse be a little calm , you would think he would have a bit of a more worried reaction and not take it so lightly . . he be a cross between Eric from little mermaid and zoro rid off on the horse . now cinderellum be tell to get on the shop , she shoe and foot while step up onto the ship look really fat and ugly . . totally aweful animation . on the ship she look like Jane Wendy 's daughter from peterpan . she bang be all fray and she look like 13 year old . now the prince ride off behind the ship and once he jump onto the ship he be look a lot like a Zoro , even he skin tone be darker if you compare it to when they show the dream of he and cinderellum dancing at the ball . also what with the hand palm thingy , look like something from TARZAN !! Notice cinderellum 's fray bang and hair , once she hug and swing around with the prince she hair start to turn back into perfect form . now thing calm down a bit and you think its go to end ... hold on to you seat , it be not over yet ! Cinderella be rest near the king once prince bring she back to the palance , notice in the first scene she have she hair nice and out , then when the servent come to tell the king that they be not able to find the step mother and sister cinderella now have she hair tie back with a blue ribbon , then in the following scene she hair be back to be out without a ribbon , STUPID , pay attention to detail disney , HELLO . what be with bride prepare themselves ? this scene remind I of mulan get ready for she wedding with mushu on top of the closet , really strange . the pumpkin just have to be include in the movie somehow , honestly I find this scene where cinderellum get stuck inside quite scary and gross . ok she make she escape and if you pause the scene right when she be on the horse look at the castle in the distance notice she foot , it be huge ! even she hand look huge . Disney , DETAILS ! Cinderella savagly rid all the way to the palace while the wedding be ongoing , the priest look like something from star war , freaky . - ok , cinderellum appear , break up the ceremony , step mother be shout at anastasium and once she start use the magic it be like prince just step in there use he sword to divert the magic away from cinderellum , it look so lame and he facial expression be not heroic or anything . note cinderellum 's hairdo , it be tie up high in a bun , however when she be prepare for the wedding it be low behind she neck , kind of strange . I do not like the fairy 's voice in the end , it sound so squeaky . now after the credit and the little `` photo '' which show some really goofy one once you reach the last one with the heart frame rose and cinderellum and the prince in the middle notice they hand , I think they go just a bit too far with this !!!

'' they be even more exellent when view together .  Next , head back to the movie , but turn on the audio commentary this time . host by Roy E.

I ` dve much prefer it over `` follow the Leader , '' but really would have like both . oh well .  lastly , there be a new trailer for `` return to never land '' -lrb- not either of the theatrical one ; this one have some really great new footage -rrb- that be worth a look before you go see the movie . and if you buy this before March 31 , you child will get in free -- as a extra bonus , there be one free child 's admission movie ticket for `` return '' inside every special Edition dvd and video .  in addition to all this , new trailer show that among other `` Beauty and the beast '' and `` the many adventure of Winnie the Pooh '' will make it to dvd this year -lrb- finally -rrb- in October for the former and May for the latter . great news , I think . plus there be a really cute Disney tv spot call `` Magic happen '' on the second menu of trailer .  all in all , this be a wonderful dvd -- much better then the limited issue edition -- and I be glad to own it . something you should not miss ! \*\*\*\*\* -lrb- 5\/5 -rrb-

I be somehow remind of `` Conspiracy Theory '' in that it be a disappointment consider the possibility it offer . mostly , the problem be in the basic premise of the story . any one of thousand of conflict could have be play out , but instead , we see a personal crime in Voigt 's character take out on a unsuspecting citizen . this may sound minor , but we could have see a glimpse of some big-brother massacre , and the minor hero who overcome it . some of what be offer here make you wonder -lrb- in worried fascination -rrb- what be possible , but generally I can say this be not a must-see movie . if you see Conspiracy Theory , do not bother with this one .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I guess I be extremely spoil by season 1 -lrb- see my review there -rrb- , wait all those year to find that once the show have return , it be back with a spine tingling , take you breath away with excitement , jump out of you seat in disbelief of such glorious script and performance , absolute freak vengeance . now , onto series 2 , I be in no doubt look and expect nearly the same , albeit with a different actor at the helm . this be nothing different for who fan , and with some slim exception , it all work out well . I know some of you say we can not compare this and series one , or this and that , but hey , it be what who fan have be do throughout time . I firmly believe that as a entire season , last season series 1 of the new show rank up there as possibly the best full run of episode in who be full run . have to follow that would be a true test indeed , and while I think season 2 be very enjoyable , it be not quite as strong as 1 . there be evidence even in the promising first episode , the Christmas Invasion , that there be some little je ne sais quoi that I could not quite put a finger on , that make be ever so slightly down a notch from the high impact of season 1 's show . there be further evidence when it come to season 2 's first real episode , New Earth , as it muddle along without a whole lot of excitement to take in . thankfully , after the very good reunion of the doctor , Sarah Jane , & K9 , the show seem to keep creep up and up in excitement quality , until the brilliant season finale two parter . in fact , this two part mind blow season finish , be probably the first time I have feel as ecstatic as I do watch the entire first series episode . I be displeased that the second season never feel as unique as series 1 , but nonetheless still have fun watch yet another strong run of episode in who be continue history . after think about it more and more , I come to the realization that it be less David Tennant vs. Eccleston that make the two series different , and more about the strong writing of series 1 compare to the medoicre script of season 2 . season 1 just have more snappy dialogue for the doctor , more impactful event tightly weave into the 50 minute episode , and overall better story . that be not to say this season do not have it be share of goody , include one of my favorite , idiot 's Lantern , deal with supernatural event in the 1950 's , and lead into the very spooky two parter , the impossible planet , and the Satan pit . it be just I could not help but think when I watch season 1 , that this be hand down the best show on tv , the best sci-fus episode on tv , and the best who in a long time . with season 2 , I can not safely say that I enjoy it better than say a season of the dead Zone , Stargate , or Stargate Atlantis , but I can say it be a very enjoyable piece of sci fi and another superb addition to the who Universe . I just wish the script be tighter and flow better . on to David Tennant . it take I a few episode , for I to take a liking to he , but quickly find that he be just as quirky a doc as any predecessor and deserve he worthy place among the rest . he can bring he serious side out just as quickly and believable as he distinct , flamboyant one . I think have he a second season will be a welcome event , after have Eccleston for one short one . hopefully , they will get the write a little more up to snuff , and the excitement level , so I can once again , safely say there be nothing better on tv than who . for right now , I can not , but it be still a excellent season of who , a smooth transition into a new doctor , and leave at a point where this new , yet old , franchise can continue to grow . here 's look toward season 3 ...

Movies_TV	NEG	1	Pretty decent movie , fast pace , keep you interest . however , this be not a widescreen anamorphic dvd . instead , it be a inferior , old-tech letterboxed edition . in other word , you can still see it correctly in you widescreen tv , but with a magnify setting ; therefore , you lose vertical resolution . do not buy this inferior-quality product .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Peter Pan be one of the Ultimate Disney classic . the restoration make it even more enjoyable this time around . this be the perfect keepsake ... my child will love grow up watch this !
Movies_TV	NEG	2	I miss the day of Disney classic with good storytelling and good theme . unfortunately , Disney have not tell a good animated story since Tarzan . Pixar do it well , but Disney insist on recycle they old classic in the way of straight to dvd movie . Cinderella III be just another sophomoric recycling of a Disney classic . the plot be unbelievable and silly -lrb- how could the Fairy Godmother be so careless ? -rrb- , the character sound like every other animated character , the song be generic Broadway and all sound the same , and why do the stepsister have such beautiful singing voice ? in the original Cinderella , they could not carry a tune to save they life . do they tone-deafness all of a sudden disappear ? if you have child , this may amuse they , although this no where near capture the spirit of the original . the quality of this be no greater than a Saturday morning cartoon .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	my 4 year old daughter love anything princess and therefore love this movie with its `` happily ever after '' end . as a adult , I be disappoint . since I have never see the second movie I do not know if the sister Anastasia change , but she be different in this movie . how do someone so spoil and mean become the character she be in iii ? also , the king be no longer interested in grandchild , but true love , which be not part of he character in the original . I guess what I be say be that the character do not seem to line up with the original character . I will say there be some redeeming thing about this movie ; namely that Cinderella be more independent and resourceful here .
Movies_TV	POS	4	do not expect much from a Will Smith movie for some reason , always think of he as a bit of a lightweight , so maybe that be why I be amaze at how good , tight , exciting , and disturb this movie turn out to be , and Will 's performance be superb .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I find it to be charming , and the `` twist '' in the story , while not original , quite please to the overall story and make Cinderella III more connect to the first Disney 's Cinderella than be the second film .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have love the story of Cinderella since I be a child . I do not see Cinderella 2 , but when `` Cinderella 3 - a twist in Time '' come out I buy it . I watch it with my four year old granddaughter and we both enjoy the story . Cinderella 's stepmother get the Fairy god mother 's magic wand after Anastasia steal it , and go back in time . the animation be very good and the story be delightful . my granddaughter love it and we have watch it many time . most sequel do not live up to the original , this one come very close and do not disappoint . Great Disney movie for the entire family .
Movies_TV	POS	4	still on the line of Dotor who . a great sci-fus .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my whole family love this movie . everyone be glue to the tv especially I since I have not see it for year .
Movies_TV	POS	5	in response to two other reviewer here , the `` if you believe in fairy clap you hand '' scene be in many other version of `` Peter Pan , '' include the various widely-seen tv production , but it be never in the Disney cartoon . those who think it be be mix up they memory .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	a very long and boring movie to say the least . it be way too confusing and have enough story for 3 movie . it get too frantic sometimes and the end be all mess and keep I way too confused . not enough explain . good act though -lrb- which be what save it -rrb- but there be way to much empty space in between .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this workout do offer some cardio benefit . it also do introduce you to some basic Bhangra step . it be not a serious workout or dance video . I would not buy it just `` to mix up my workout '' .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I watch Cinderlla 3 last night . there be a lot of hype surround the film , but I think it be pretty good . the first Cinderella - the timeless classic - attract audience of all age . as we already know , the story be perfect and have the ultimate culmination : '' ... but I have the other slipper ... '' the second Cinderella be just three mini-story weave together to make a hour and a half movie . the story be best suit for child under age 9 . -lrb- these be the kind of featurette that would appear on a Saturday morning cartoon series , for example - the plot be simple , the dialogue be pretty cheesy , and nothing be really accomplish at the end . -rrb- Cinderella 3 obviously do not compare to the classic first , but in all truth , it be a legitimate film that will extract all the emotion you have pull from the first film . on that topic , however , the level of `` emotion pull '' have change , probably in a attempt to keep the movie viable in today 's market . for one , the wicked step-mother be now about ten time more wicked . the first movie play she as a cold antagonist with a more slithery approach to she wickedness . in Cinderella 3 , that same step-mom now conduct open act of evil -lrb- and only a few slithery action -rrb- . why be that important ? because a overwhelmingly evil step-mother dwarf the emotion of feeling sorry for Cinderella . in the classic film , one could not help but feel so terrible for poor Cinderella as she work so hard and be not reward . now , Cinderella be punish for be nice . this change the whole concept of the `` Cinderella Story . '' now you just want that old haggard step-mom to get drug from the back of a horse-drawn pumpkin carriage - you could care less if Cinderella win the prince back or live happily ever after . that be , the irony that be bind to happen -lrb- good defeat evil in a Disney film -rrb- be not as spectacularly fantastic as the classic film when Cinderella produce the second , miss slipper . the irony of Cinderella 3 be that the step-mom merely get she comeuppance . but this movie also play on the personality and feeling of Anastasia , which I generally find kind of weird . it separate she from drizzellum which to I be awkward . I appreciate the dueling sister who only act in concert to harm Cinderella 's interest . now the movie pull out the possible good in one of the three main antagonist . Cinderella 2 explore this the most , however , but I think it be brutally do . basically , Anastasia be a `` good trapped inside '' dumb-dumb , as one would be leave to think . Anastasia basically want thing but do not know how to get they , but somehow manage in the end , usually from revelation or help from Cinderella . sure , that make Cinderella seem even more like the saint that she be for help she sister -lrb- who apparently still hate Cinderella , even when she help -rrb- . but it draw so much focus away from we one true star : the lady who go from rag to riches and define a brand new storyline for other to coin or imitate . to give Cinderella 3 a side credit , albeit minor , be that it `` follow the rule . '' namely , the rule regard `` bippity boppity boo , '' magic , and the animal and they interaction . the talk mouse , the effect of the magic on the animal , and the history of each character -lrb- include whatever may have be grotesquely alter in Cinderella 2 with lucifer fall in love , Anastasia desire and find love , or Cinderella be conflict with she new title in royalty -rrb- make amends for Cinderella 2 's near-fatal depiction . that be a hard challenge , but these Disney movie-maker get it right in Cinderella 3 . to close , Cinderella 3 be best suit for child age 12 or under per my review . it will not reach out to the heart of ad ult like the original classic do , and it will not draw the emotion you would expect from the classic Cinderella Story that Disney found back in the day . due to its simple storyline and re-focus of character ' significance and portrayal in the film , I can only recommend this film if you child actually like -lrb- or be entertain by -rrb- Cinderella 2 , or if he\/she really still love the character since his\/her last viewing of the original Cinderella . do not expect much from Cinderella 3 -lrb- especially its replay value -rrb- so that when you do watch it , you will not be disappoint when you compare it to the monumental classic .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have see this movie on dvd 4 time in a month . it be a example of what yu wanna see ... exciting , believable plot , fantastic production & act from Will , Gene & ` that guy ' from the NSA . if you wanna show off yur dvd to friend , show this ...
Movies_TV	POS	4	I borrow this dvd from my local library , but purchase it because it be such a fun workout . I expect to be more annoyed than anything during the workout , but actually start to have fun while vigoroussly shake my hip . it can be difficult to keep up with the action , however . the narration do not always give you a lot of warn prior to transition to new move , but that do not hinder my workout .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this movie should be toss out , just as `` song of the South '' be . I be not sure what to say when my daughter ask why the native American be call himself the `` red man . '' in addition , Tinkerbell be portray as a sexualized , vindictive , jealous female stereotype from another era . we may have to throw this one away .
Movies_TV	POS	5	when you hear the name `` Will Smith '' you think comedy . well in this film he prove he be much much more . probably the highest pay black actor and with very good reason . with extreme talent he play he role in the film very nicely . Jean Hackman be also brilliant . get the film !
