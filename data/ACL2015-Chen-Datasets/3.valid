Flashlight	POS	5	I have have this for about five month now and so far its hold up good . I test it with the 2d maglite and the 4d maglite and there be never any problem the snap button have never get loose . but when i do receive my package the packaging for it be really greasy .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have 6 of they and one in my car . I give one to my mom . I tell she you use to hit someone over the head if you need to lol I tell she also if there be ever a fire use it to brake out the window with it . one of mine be at least 13 year old . sure you be spend a little more for maglite but they last for ever . I have drop mine from about 30 foot the dam thing still work great . this week i pick up 10 pack of d battery with spring come up and bad weather .
Flashlight	POS	4	as a goverment Motor Vehicle Inspector and use many flash light over 16 year this be the best ever . the DOT would not be the same without it .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have be work night shift highway patrol work for go on 19 year . I be still use the same rechargeable mag Lite that I be issue in 1990 -lrb- the same model as list here -rrb- . I have wear out half a dozen squad car , and receive a new mounting\/charger bracket with each new car , but always keep the same flashlight . I have have to replace the little rubber button over the switch a couple of time as my thumb wear through it finally . but the light be the same one I be originally issue . it be very , very bright and completely reliable . it have be drop -lrb- if you drop it switch on , it will probably knock the bulb dead -rrb- , submerge , chill to 17 below and 150 above , and switch on\/off literally ten of thousand of time . it be have a few high speed ride outside lay on the air intake below my windshield wiper . I have knock out car window with it , have use it as a impact weapon , and have even use the butt end for a hammer . I have work numerous squad car crash , and have never see a instance of a maglite that have jump out of its mount bracket due to a crash . there be room in the endcap to keep a spare bulb tuck in a piece of foam or napkin . the bulb last a long time and be easily replace . the battery stick last a long time -lrb- about 2 hour on a charge -rrb- and it be as easy to replace as change any flashlight battery . if you use the light for public safety work -lrb- police , fire , EMS , security -rrb- , and keep it in you in-car mount\/charger bracket , you will likely never see it go dim ... until it reach end of life , which be every couple of year with heavy use . it be big enough to use for self-defense , and can easily be carry on a duty belt by slip it though the handcuffs carry there , or you can use a ring make for that purpose , or just slip it inside you beltline behind you back . and -lrb- this be important -rrb- it be big enough to be carry by tuck it under you armpit , thus leave both hand free . you can not do that with small flashlight . it be also big enough not to be easily lose in the grass in the dark , like some of the hi-tech minus flashlight . I like this light so much that about 10 year ago I purchase another one out of pocket and mount the charger on the workbench in my garage . that have turn out as equally successful as my shop flashlight . when you buy this kit , you 'll get one charger\/mounting sleeve that you can mount in either home or car , and they include the proper electrical hardware to power it up by plug into either home or car power source . that be my experience . this thing be a workhorse and I consider it a `` partner '' at work . I highly recommend it .
Flashlight	POS	4	for my use this work great . so far I have not have any issue get the light it in or out , it do hit the on button sometimes and make the light flash when you pull it out . I have not break it in yet , and the button to close it be very tight , it take a really firm tug to open it , I assume it will eventually get easier , if not too easy to open . if you pack a flashlight every day you might want one deign for that , but if you like I and just pack it on you person occasionally -lrb- camp trip , hunting , fishing ... -rrb- this work fine .
Flashlight	POS	5	I already have 2 of these for 4 yr . buy these for additional location and great price . good design , rugged , flexible beam , easy to see , interchangeable rechargeable battery .
Flashlight	NEG	2	the quality be great and it be easy to operate . I buy a couple of these as keychain light . however , the light output even with a fresh battery really be not sufficient for my use .
Flashlight	POS	5	I purchase this product to be use by a entire division of over 25 personel onboard a NAVY vessel . in the workspace , temperature be always over 100 degree , and the flashlight have be drop numerous time on steel deck . the Maglight have even be submerge in oily water , and I have not have one problem with it .
Flashlight	POS	5	great product . i look in all my local store and could only find a 14.4 volt bulb so i look here and sure enuf they have just what i be lookin for !
Flashlight	POS	5	for a small flashlight that use aa 's , this thing be bright . I also like that additional and useful accessory that you can purchase separately .
Flashlight	NEU	3	this be the great flashlight for the cost . it be very bright , and the focus beam be very useful . they claim it be waterproof . I drop mine in water and it still work , kind-of . it be very dim and practically useless . grant , it sit in the water for about 5 minute , and it have a ph of 11 , so I think it go beyond the intended exposure . it 'll last forever in you garage , but if you be buy it for industrial use , do not expect it to last forever .
Flashlight	NEG	2	I have a 3-d cell and a 2-aa lead maglight as well as a 2-aa regular maglight . my complaint with the 2-aa maglight , whether lead or regular bulb be that they do not hold they charge . I have keep both 2-aa maglight in my car , and barely use it , yet the battery get drain . the 2-aa maglight be not good with battery life when you have it store for several month . I have also store my 2-aa non lead flashlight in my house , and same problem , the battery get drain and I barely use the darn thing . but I guess that be why the maglight be so much cheaper than say streamlight or the other high end flashlight . the 3-d cell lead maglight however be great , battery life hold when store in the house for month , and when use it it do not die on you and keep its brightness .
Flashlight	POS	5	great size and light power . . I use flashlight for work and this 3 c battery model have be my favorite for year .
Flashlight	NEU	3	this flashlight be construct to the same high standard as the other maglite that I have use . however , the beam quality be not as good as my d and aa maglite . it provide a good spot focus but the wide-angle beam be very non-uniform , which can make see where you be walk at night difficult . I have find the beam quality of the 2AA Maglite to be much superior for walk outside after dark .
Flashlight	POS	5	I need one of these to have my flashlight with I when work ... really cumbersome carry it in my backpocket ... especially when one have to do any climbing or co into crouch position . the clasp be very sturdy leather and the actual holder seem to be a hard plastic type material which can fold up against the clasp , conveniently , when not in use .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have a five d-cell maglite since 1986 and it be still work great ; I have only have to replace two lamp within that time . I be a scoutmaster for year and the boy call my flashlight , `` the Sun '' . when they would try to sneak off I could always find they ... the flashlight light up the whole mountain or I could narrow the beam and spot a boy nearly a mile away . I buy this six-celled maglite because I be tire of always have a lone battery with my five-celled light because battery be not package in odd number . that in fact be my recommendation to you to buy a six-cell maglite rather than a five-cell so you do not have a odd battery go to waste . I now have two great flashlight one be under my bed and the other be on my refrigerator where they be always available for emergency and light up the whole dang town if I have too : - -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have Maglite 's for many year . this be a gift for my kid and I be amaze at how bright these light shine . it be compact and the candle light feature be a nice touch which be actually extremely practical for outside dining on camping trip .
Flashlight	NEG	2	the Mag-Lite Solitaire be well design and well make but simply be not bright enough . however , if all you use a flashlight for be look for you key under the seat of you car or assist with read menu , it may be ok . it have a sleek design , and it be appeareance will not draw attention on a keychain . it function like any other -lrb- large -rrb- minus mag light , by twist the end where the light come out to turn it on and off . Change the battery by unscrew the other end . a spare bulb be conceal within the end cap . pro : - it be small . - it be well make , with all component fitting together smoothly , and a clean simple appearence . con : - it be just not that bright . some of the newer led flashlight be of a similar size but much brighter . overall , I would have to give this one a pass , unless I develop a fetish for small , well design gadget -lrb- like watch , watch be SOOO cool ! and miniature sextent , those thing be sooo neat ! -rrb- . ok , so I have this fetish , and this would explain why I have a Solitaire in my toolbox .
Flashlight	NEU	3	due to its rigid aluminum construction any form of shock absorb by the light , generally from a fall at hip level or even a roll out of the truck door , will kill the bulb . I have be tell the lead version of this light be a better option as the LED 's be more durable . personally after own a few of these I find they to be over rate . they be to heavy , the beam be very weak when its widen and very small and bright when focus . I find there be no good in between . in my opinion you can get just as good performance with a smaller 2d mag light of even the aa version .
Flashlight	POS	4	so far this be a great tool to expand the use of we 18v tool battery . I wish that DeWalt would update the tool with either a lead lamp or a Xenon lamp opion becuase the lamp it use be neither super bright nor super efficient .
Flashlight	POS	5	the item be ship and arrive within a few day . the replacement battery work great for my mag light .
Flashlight	POS	5	as a firefighter for over 40 year , I can say the mag-charger be one of the most dependalbe light I have ever use . my original , which I use for 15 year , be lose at a incident scene . I immediately order a new one . I have replace the battery stick only one time . it be mount in my vehicle and be always charge and ready to go . the service time from one charge be more that adequate for most incident . I highly recommend this product .
Flashlight	POS	4	few flashlight will grab more attention than a 6d cell maglite . it be 20 '' long and weigh well over 3 lb with battery . as allude in other review , this really gun for the guy instinct . it be exaggerated and give the same feeling as see the volume go to 11 -lrb- a la spinal tap -rrb- . ever since I first see one on display 20 year ago , I have want it -lrb- but have to settle for a Mini-Mag -rrb- . of course , as a Maglite , it live up to they reputation of be virtually indestructable and a good substitute for a baseball bat . however , in light of recent innovation in led technology , it do not have as much practical value . as one would expect with a 6d -lrb- 9 volt -rrb- light , it be one that can signal satellite . when I first see it , it be brighter than anything else , at least operating from standard battery . 20 year later , it still use the same technology , albeit with the availability of the Xenon `` mag-num '' bulb , which add 23 % brightness -lrb- per Maglite 's web site -rrb- . other technology have emerge that make this beast show its age , especially the so-called `` tactical '' light , some of which be smaller than a mini-mag , but brighter than the 6d . do not get I wrong . it be tough as nail and extraordinarily bright . but , the 3d cell maglite with the led upgrade put out a comparable amount of light , while consume only half the battery and be 40 % smaller . as of this writing -lrb- 7\/2007 -rrb- , there be no led upgrade bulb available from Maglite , save the 4d cell version , use with 2 dummy d-cell -lrb- why ? -rrb- third-party vendor have some good one , but they be either dimmer or do not focus . one even cost $ 75 + -lrb- for a $ 25 chassis -rrb- . one company boast its upgrade bulb will yield 140 lumen ; for comparison , the mag claim the 6d cell with the Xenon bulb yield 218 lumen . if Maglite be to put a lead upgrade for this light out on par with the 3d cell led upgrade , it would make this light incredibly bright and I would also give this the full five Stars . Bottom Line : if you must have a gi-normous flashlight that be well-engineered and virtually indestrctable , this be the one for you . I have one and love it , but truthfully , it be more of a novelty that satisfy some primal yearning inside of I . for emergency and everyday use , I have strategically located maglite 3d and min-mag , all lead , around the house . UPDATE : I get this 7\/17\/2007 from mag 's customer service about the 5-6 cell led upgrade : `` we do not plan on make a lead for the 5 or 6 cell light because the volume be too small to justify the tooling cost . led be voltage sensitive and if use in the wrong size light will either reduce the overall life of the lamp or blow it out . you can also purchase a battery spacer \/ dummy battery and use we 4 cell led module , model # sh34dcw6j . ''
Flashlight	POS	5	this be the greatest flashlight I have ever use . this have to be the brightest flashlight ever make .
Flashlight	POS	5	I order the maglight with holster for aa friend and like it so much I just order one for myself . Robert Amos
Flashlight	POS	5	one day i fill up the sink and put my mag instrument 3d cell battery flashlight next to the sink go to use the washroom and when i get back it fall in the sink i take it out and to my surprise it still work
Flashlight	POS	5	this be the recommend bulb for the 36V Dewalt flashlight as well , I have have mine in there for about 6month with no issue .
Flashlight	POS	4	the name `` Maglite '' have always be , to I synonymous with quality -- I have be wear this one on my belt for several year now . it be small , light-weight and have a powerful light for something this small . the beam be quite bright for a flashlight this size , and the `` candle '' mode be a nifty feature -lrb- especially when the end of the flashlight fit into the upended top -rrb- . it help I more than once , especially when in a crowded elevator during a minor power outage . my parting comment to all who be in this elevator with I - `` why do not you have a flashlight with you ? '' my only gripe -- the nylon belt-sheath , which be durable -- not only allow the flashlight to fall out in some situation , but it do not keep the rotate head of the flashlight protect . more than once someone have come up to I to say `` Umm ... you belt be all light up !! '' I solve that problem by sew a -lrb- rip-stopped -rrb- strip of nylon onto the top of the sheath -lrb- back to front -rrb- , and attach velcro to the end of the strip and to the front of the sheath , so now my maglite stay securely in the sheath . would I buy aother Maglite ? sure ! I would like to eventually buy the whole family of Maglites -- from tiny to huge . they do the job and do it well .
Flashlight	POS	5	I buy this flashlight about 18 year ago . I be a police officer and have work many night . the flaslight have be bang around and drop numerous time . it be send back to maglight once after about 5 year of use for a defective switch . maglight fix it for free . I have to buy a new battery stick twice due to the battery lose its ability to charge . the new stick cost about $ 16 . a full charge usually last I a week of do midnight . now that I work day the charge last for month . the only down side be tha it be large and heavy , but I would not replace it for anything else . if you be look for a extremely bright and durable flashlight , this be it . I just want to add that after about 18 year of use the charger cradle stop work . I send it to Maglight and they fix it for free again . now that be the way to stand behind you product . I see alot of people rave about surefire flashlight and put maglight down . well I have be a police Officer in the Bronx for nearly 20 year now and use the same rechargeable maglight . it have be bang around and look it , but it still work like new . I pay about $ 100 18 year ago and now it sell for $ 85 . let see you $ 200 surefire after 18 year -lrb- I do not think so -rrb- .
Flashlight	POS	5	i love the feel of this . i keep this in my car and i feel safer in more way than one . ; - -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	if you be sick of constantly buy battery , and never have a flashlight handy , buy this gem . it be awesome , especially if you already have sink a few hundred into other dewalt product and wish you could use those battery for something else ! it be bright and take a beating !
Flashlight	NEG	2	essentially this add up to have a $ 60-ish workhorse powerhouse of a battery on the base , with a rather cheap flashlight attachment that be worth maybe $ 5 . I have have this light hang around for a couple of year from a combo set . it actually work well enough , though I do not often need a worklight . we recently have a 4 day power outage and this be great while it last both as a very bright flashlight , and to point at the ceiling to give some nice general non-glare room illumination . it only last about two hour on a charge be the problem . if anything scream out for a lead bulb , this be it , but at this point DeWalt do not even offer that as a separate bulb . they do sell a 12v lead worklight which sound just awesome , but I do not have the 12v system , I have the 18v . with a lead this would never burn out the bulb . this one will last maybe 10-15 hour which be not what you want in a emergency light with no spare . also if you drop this light the bulb filament will probably break , LED 's be much more robust . moreover , with the same brightness it would go probably 8-12 hour on a charge or more . that would be pretty much my essential emergency light . I would buy two or three . though the gooseneck probably look like the better design . what really kill this be that the head ought to swivel so it could point downward while stand upright on the battery base . you could work at a table or workbench with the light pointed at you work . but this only swivel from straight up to horizontal , which be really not all that useful . in short , wait for they to offer the gooseneck with a led , and get two , it will be super .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have one at work and I have one at home . I can always count on it work and use it all the time .
Flashlight	POS	5	I buy several of these as gift for the guy at work . they be a great small size flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	very bright little flashlight . nice little pouch with it fit almost anywhere but be as bright as a larger flash light . still use initial battery have have for 2 + month .
Flashlight	NEG	1	both my wife and my electrician manage to break a pair of these . unless you be really careful when set the light in place , they give away . it be the cheapest of plastic and do not take a beating .
Flashlight	POS	5	I order the light and it come in 3 day with regular shipping . the light be very bright , it be very lite for it be size and stay charge for day .
Flashlight	POS	4	I be take part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine , and everyone have two tool : a Mini Maglite and a  Leatherman  they all wear they on they belt , and they come in handy on numerous occasion . of course I pick one up and I love the little holster that come with it . if it do not look dorky I would probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time . it be not just good for night use . change a fuse , adjust equipment , find something under the desk . for those kind of everyday , all-the-time use , the Mini mag be much more handy and useful than the larger  maglite  highly recommend for its simplicity , utility , and durability .
Flashlight	POS	4	I purchase a couple of these set . I have a hard time find my flashlight when the electricity go out . so , I purchase these and now I have designate place for my maglite flashlight . Safety wise , it be a good thing too . I do not like that you have to put so much pressure on the flashlight in order for it to lock in place . be careful with you finger . I get the feeling these bracket may break if you put to much pressure on they .
Flashlight	POS	5	it have the expect Maglite quality . I give this product five star . my wife be very happy with it and with the service provide by the vendor , whatever its name be .
Flashlight	POS	5	I think that this be the fourth AA Maglite that I have purchase . the oldest one be still work and date back to 1990 . these be very dependable flashlight !
Flashlight	NEG	2	Thats how this work . you rotate the top portion around and the brightness and focal length increase . but then it come off at the end . I read this about this product before , but its kind of annoy when you want to use this in a hurry and it become loose . would have prefer a switch . its quite compact and slip easily into you pocket . would buy again from Maglite , but not the same design . Advice : look for something else , but make sure it doesnt operate the same way as this device .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a excellent light . it be quite bright , well-constructed , and rest easily on the shoulder when hold in the hand . it be a unparalleled $ 25 when I buy it , and absolutely worth that pittance . I wrap around it a good length of duct tape and electrical tape , and thus make it a dispenser of each . I carry it in my car at all time .
Flashlight	POS	5	I need a small flashlight for work and have go through many , many aa size flashlight . I just notice these 2aa lead maglite in the store and decide to try one out . I be not sure how bright it would be because besides the 3 watt label , mag do not really state the brightness of the light . when I get home I be pleasantly surprise . this light be at least 5 time brighter than a regular 2aa maglite and it be also brighter than any other -lrb- include lead -rrb- flashlight I have use . and what matter more , compare to the regular bulb maglite , the beam on the LED light focus perfectly to a even circle . no more dark area . the one thing I miss be the little hole in the endcap which can be use for lanyard or keyring . also the lead version be a tad bit longer than the bulb version , but for the huge performance gain , I 'll gladly have a slightly larger flashlight . I can not comment on the battery usage yet , as I have not have to change battery yet , a good sign ... and I be so glad that I do not have to worry about the little bulb burn out every so often anymore . I can highly recommend this light , it be well worth the money if you need a good flashlight . I do wish that the other color be available as show on mag 's website . Amazon or any other local store just seem to have the black version .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a nice , sturdy , flashlight in a metal casing . it have a nice bright beam and fit easily into a drawer . it be a definite improvement over the cheap plastic flashlight that I have . Amazon have it at a good price . I recommend .
Flashlight	POS	4	all man like flashlight , perhaps its a carryover from we day as caveman when we always make sure we have fire available . the mag be the equivalent of a muscle car . sure there be smaller , faster and even cheaper flashlight but the mag just work . its totally no-nonsense and have the product recognition value equivalent to Apple Computer . the drawback be many . its big , heavy , the krypton light be not the best and the adjustable beam be rather ragged look but it put out a good amount of light and be tough enough to be drop , use as a self defense weapon , improvise hammer , dog repellent , or crowbar . you can get a xenon bulb for greater light output at the expense of battery life , or a lead upgrade which drop right in . many police force stop use the mag not because it be a bad flashlight but because they be beat suspect to death with they so they be force to use cr123 base minus tactical light . that one tough flashlight . they be not overly expensive , as there be other out there cost 4-5 time as much and frankly I be unsure why they charge such a premium . they be make in the USA so they can be consider a reasonably patriotic purchase .
Flashlight	NEG	1	light wont stay on . after filing and sand all contact area it improve a little . I still have to bang it to stay on . very disapointed . flashlight from a dollar store be better .
Flashlight	NEU	3	I have have several of these for many year . good for find a keyhole . have now discover the 3 aa lead mag . major improvement , a REAL light up the night instrument ! for twice the cost , it be 5 time the light . pass on the 2 aa , move up to the 3 aa lead !
Flashlight	POS	5	the Sheriffs deputy in we police department carry the `` magcharger '' system flashlight for decade , and the reason be very clear : this be one of the most powerful semi-compact flashlight on the market . there be a lot of great flashlight out there , and the latest led light be awesome for light output , longevity , and burn time , but you really can not mess with perfection . I have have the chance to use the rx1019 for a long time because a family member be a cop and carry one . my first impression be holy cow ! I have see some really bright light , the 9 volt search and rescue spot light , 5 + watt lead light from Surefire , Pelican , etc. , but the mag be as bright , if not brighter , and cost $ 100 less than the Surefire . this be not a led-type lamp light system . it use a high-pressure halogen bulb fill with xenon and krypton gas . it be similar to the one in you car . Streamlight 's Stinger -lrb- also a awesome light , which I own -rrb- series use they as well to great effect . the difference between the halogen and lead lamp be that the led do not use a filament to generate light , so they last longer , run considerably cooler , and use less energy -lrb- more efficient -rrb- . they also produce light that be closer on the Kelvin scale to daylight , so it be much purer , whiter light , which provide better visibility at night . they can be very powerful , but they just do not produce the same effect as a halogen bulb , and lead technology be still be perfect . in the box , you get the flashlight , charge cradle , battery , car adapter , ac adaptor , and two mount plate for mount the charge cradle to a wall or other surface . the Nicad battery be not a `` sub-c '' type , but have cell similar in size to c-cell battery for increase run time . in fact , mag claim 2-hour run time , and I can substantiate that . it do take a while to charge it though . I really like the Magcharger . it be not `` small '' at over 12 inch long and 1-1\/2 inch thick , or lightweight either -lrb- that big battery stick be heavy , but without it , the light be really lightweight -rrb- . it weigh 2 or so pound , which be not really a detriment . every mating surface -lrb- tail cap , lens bezel , focus head -rrb- , include the switch , be rubber seal for water resistance . it be get a temper glass lens that be really tough and unlikely to break . you get a spare bulb in the tail cap , and change the bulb be simple : unscrew the lens bezel , take out the lens , and pull out the bulb . plus , it be beautiful . it be construct of aircraft aluminum that be be machine from a billet , and it be make entirely of aluminum , then anodize with gloss black inside and out for maximum corrosion resistance in marine and other harsh environment -lrb- think Iraq , the desert -rrb- . the body be knurl for a good grip , and the charge contact be actually a polished aluminum ring that encircle the front of the light behind the switch . the weight and heft of the light be actually beneficial because you can use it as a weapon if you have to . cop know this , and this be why they carry the mag . it be a effective weapon as well . Cold hard aluminum can do serious damage . this toughness also mean it be well-protected from abuse . I have hear story of these be run over , drop off building , fall out of the back of a pickup on the highway , and submerge for day and they still work -lrb- bulb might need change -rrb- . now for the flashlight part of the mag . to say it be bright be a understatement . this thing be really bright . Maglite say you can get 40,000 candle power , which be a lot . it throw a bright shaft of light over 250 foot in spot mode . focus it to flood and you can illuminate a very large area . the focus action be very solid , with no noticable play or eccentrcity . up close , the beam be positively blind . this be much brighter than my Streamlight Stinger , which be already very bright . the beam be very powerful . if you be to shine someone in the eye with this , it would be debilitating and disorienting , which be good if you be a cop enter a house with possible suspect inside , or in a home defense situation . it be almost like this be make for law enforcement ! the only gripe I can think of revolve around the nature of the beast . the lens area get really hot during extend operation and can burn you if you come into contact with it . also , the Nicad battery stick only last about a year of constant charge\/discharge cycle , and replace it be expensive . plus , maybe a minor gripe , you can not use it in a HazMat environment . so ... pro : Super bright can be use as a defensive weapon adjustible beam high quality construction solidly build water resistant good run time rechargable will outlast you Cons : Lens get very hot battery pack do not last very long can not use it in HazMat environment I really like the Magcharger . it do everything you want it to very well , and even do a little more . it be beautiful , reliable , durable , and a high quality instrument that will last you for year and year . if you be look for a new light , but do not want a led , or want something bigger than the Stinger , check out the rx1019 .
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be awesome . it be just about 2 foot long . it could easily be use defensively since it look like a baseball bat flashlight . it put out 160 luke which be great for this more natural look light . great buy and very happy .
Flashlight	POS	4	Mine be order with lead bulb , which extend battery life a lot . that be useful in case there be need to search for someone lose . c-battery do not make it excessively heavy , though so far have not have to carry mine for hour . I get the idea from a magazine article by Massad Ayoob .
Flashlight	POS	4	I be seek a AA Maglite flashlight and notice the `` lead upgrade '' offerer by a number of vendor . I find this flashlight and decide to buy it because it be the genuine maglite brand and feature the lead bulb . the lamp be much brighter and the light be much whiter without the dark spot typical of the standard maglite bulb . what be disappointing be that its larger than the standard size aa maglite , and the larger size feel strange in the hand . I wind up buy the standard aa maglite and the nite-ize led upgrade .
Flashlight	POS	5	what more can I say - it ' a a MagLite & it work in Sub-Zero Deg f - -rrb- `` no surprise '' . a few suggestion for the unknow on the use of the mode : full power : for distance work - full saturation 25 % power : use during reading ; close work not blind by surface reflection ; extend usage Strobe : Beacon for warn or attention when use color lens -lrb- optional -rrb- ; search & rescue locator SOS : Beacon for search & rescue locator finally , later model tail cap permit a lanyard to be attach . why MagLite put out the earlier led model with the `` FLAT Tail Cap '' be beyond I .
Flashlight	POS	5	unless you want to spend hundred on a flashlight -lrb- see streamlight-primarily use by fireman -rrb- you can not find a better unit than a maglite . I have AAA , AA , C and D cell maglte flashlight . both my wife and I feel that the c cell size be easier to hold than the d cell model . I really prefer the 3 c cell model-i find the length just right , though the 2 cell model fit in car better . make in the USA . and can be easily upgrade to a lead ` bulb ' . a little bonus : if you live in hurricane territory , when the store run out of d cell battery , there be always c cell battery on the shelf , mean you can get battery when other can not .
Flashlight	POS	5	we have own a few cheap-o led minus flashlight , but think it would be smart to have a higher quality item with we camping tool , so I purchase this one . this mini maglite led be perfect ! it out-shine we other 3 lead light , have a focus option for the beam -lrb- very helpful ! -rrb- , a all-metal housing , and the quality feel you get with all maglite product . I be so please with this light , I be order a couple more to replace the one we keep in we glovebox .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I can not believe they still make this . I have have my aa maglight since 8th grade . I have replace the bulb about 10 time back in the day . as soon as led light come out - I upgrade , and NEVER look back . Modern lead light be way bright , much more durable , and many of they much smaller . Cheapo Fenix single AAA be build better than this , be much smaller , and MUCH BRIGHTER . I just can imagine a single instance when I would recommend this .
Flashlight	NEU	3	always know where you flashlight be with these handy clip . Works on most `` d '' cell flashlight in either the horizontal or vertical position . one clip be sufficient for a 2-cell flashlight . I keep one one the wall by the garage door so I always know where the flashlight be . it would work equally well in a car , truck , boat , or camper . I be think about mount one on my bike handlebars : -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	when three tornado hit my board school , I come to realize the importance of a flashlight -lrb- which I didnt have at the time , unfortunately -rrb- . realize my error in not own such a essential item , I immediately go to the store and buy one . my family have own -lrb- and lose -rrb- numerous flashlight , and we mag lite be by far the best flashlight we have ever own . some flashlight go on and off as the battery jiggle around , die as soon as you drop they , or just be not make to live long . mag lite be definitely not these flashlight ! my minus Maglite have be drop , kick , stomp , squish , throw , everything ... and it still work great ! it be three year old now and still work like it do on day one . it do not suck battery dry , which be definitely a plus , and the light be constant . it do not flicker on and off if teh battery somehow shake . I love how you can change the beam to cover a large area or focus in on a small area . it be great for late night read in the dorm room . now I even own a small MagLite Solitaire for my keychain . it be very small but just as powerful . altogether , a great little flashlight and a excellent price .
Flashlight	POS	5	a well know , try and true product with enormous light output and long battery life . we own many .
Flashlight	NEU	3	this flashlight be ok in most situation , but only put out 2 lumen of light . I suggest get a flashlight that have more lumen .
Flashlight	POS	4	the Mag Charger , as all maglite , be a american icon -- we all love they and love use mag 's ! although there be many product on the market which be superior -lrb- as with the Harley-Davidson -rrb- I still like my MagLite more than other . I have upgrade this mag charger with the excellent terralux -lrb- of USA -rrb- tle-300mr which be a 600 luman lead upgrade . WOW ! the basic product be still great and have the shape , fit and finish we be all use to -lrb- and be make in USA like TerraLUX -rrb- while the performance be unsurpassed ! way to go .
Flashlight	NEG	2	these be decent light for navigate the wood in the dark , but if you do ... get two of they . they like to cut out often , require a sharp rap to get work again ... then they work just fine for a bit ... and repeat the entire scenario all over again . it be as though the contact be inferior and unable to provide a constant load to the led bulb . why do they send more of those stupid nylon sheath ? I have to have at least twenty of they now over the year , and have yet to actually find any use for any of they . on a positive note , they be plenty bright , and the battery last quite a while , if they would just always work as they should , they would be great ... but they just plain do not ... not at all dependable .
Flashlight	POS	5	to start , I be a tradesman who have to carry he lifeline on he belt . not only on the job , but I be also the unnofficial handyman of this apartment complex . every time I even move to take my workbelt off , it seem to be a signal for a neighbor to bang on the wall say something be on fire or will not open all the way . and the Mini mag be the universal flashlight . it be sell everywhere , include this fine site and even family store , and despite its legendary quality and design , be at the most ten dollar with include holster . I prefer the classic aa design , where CA not you find aa ? I have use one of these on my belt for about four year . it be a excellent tool , and I have never have one wear out on I . the bulb , however , be the Achilles heel . the rest of the flashlight be military , police and trade quality , for civilian price . but these dang bulb go orange after a couple week and last a couple month of casual use . I be consider shell out forty buck for a small led , just to save the money on bulb . then , walk through a sport outlet , I pass the flashlight section . and next to the usual Mini mag with holster , which I own close to six of , be a Nite ize accessory design for this same flashlight . a lead bulb . now , I have see these online for about twenty to thirty buck , and this be a ten dollar flashlight ! but this one just sit around on a shelf be eight buck , about a buck less than the flashlight 's shelf price . what the heck , I get one . to quote another review , my trusty old mag be now a state-of-the-art torch , with nearly triple battery life of the old bulb . and led , as all mag-hater know , do not burn out or even go out when bump . so , for a total of twenty buck , you get a american-quality led beam that compete and plain out whip fifty-dollar import with plastic casing . I would not recomend this flashlight if there be not there be a way to fix its biggest flaw . just get you hand on this led adapter , and put it in like you would the standard bulb . replace the mirror reflector , and stomp the old bulb into powder . you will not be need they , ever again . there be also a combo pack availiable , for the same price , that include a push-button adapter if you have ever wish you could tap a red button on the end instead of twist it on and off . I have not try it , but it come with the LED , and for eight buck ? and hey , the flashlight itself come in six different color . these thing be easily replace if one get bang up or you room-mate\/girlfriend draw all over it with sharpie while she be on the phone . I have have these work perfectly even they have be through Hades and back , but some prefer a more formal-looking flashlight . just take the lead out and put it in the new one , those bulb last forever . and now , so will this flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be simply the best flash light I have ever use . really like the light focus feature and solid feel .
Flashlight	POS	5	not much need to be say , a fantastic light that have serve I for year . it just get to be time to replace a very old one . I stand by the traditional bulb for the same reason I recommend the 3 cell over the 2 cell , they be better if you need to crack somebody in the skull .
Flashlight	POS	5	maglite s2c016 black c cell flashlight , 2-c  awesome !!
Flashlight	POS	5	this very portable flashlight be heavy and sturdy . it have be drop several time , with no damage to the glass . the illumination be also quite strong for the size of the flashlight , and will last for several week of use without a battery change . this be easily the most durable flashlight of its kind ; you be likely to lose it before you damage it .
Flashlight	NEG	2	wow . never buy another torch again ! portable light , without heat . this thing be _ AMAZING _ . beware , it do eat battery . also , do not look directly into the fire , as it may temporarily blind you ! mag be back with another winner here !
Flashlight	POS	5	for Makita owner , I can confirm that this bulb do work in the Makita 18V flashlight , and it seem just as bright as the original Makita bulb .
Flashlight	POS	5	Maglite flashlight be renown for they top-notch quality , they waterproof \/ water resistant design , and they extremely durable and corrosion-resistant aircraft grade aluminum casing . the Maglite AA Mini Flashlight -lrb- model : m2a01h -rrb- be no exception . pro -- - come with a Holster the holster have a loop for thread a belt through . it be well-stitched and make of durable nylon . - waterproof \/ water resistant the maglite be immersible in a few foot of water . - durable the aircraft grade aluminum make the casing of the Maglite extremely durable and completely corrosion resistant . - small and portable the maglite be handy for emergency , hike , camping and other use - and its small size make it very portable for take it along anywhere you go so you would not be catch without a flashlight when you need one ! - well-crafted and beautiful con -- - Painted Exterior The black paint of the exterior be extremely durable but it can get inadvertantly scratch off . if that be a concern , I would recommend the silver maglite , which have a bare , unpainted aluminum surface . - incandescent flashlight bulb the incandescent flashlight bulb that come with the Maglite can blow out , especially when subject to extreme temperature . LED Flashlight Bulb Replacement ------------------------------- the  terralux lead flashlight bulb  lead light bulb be brighter , use less energy , and have a 30,000 hour lifespan . conclusion ---------- the Maglite Mini Flashlight be waterproof \/ water resistant , portable , and have a extremely durable exterior . if use with a lead flashlight bulb , the Maglite Mini Flashlight be a extremely bright and reliable light source that consume very little battery power . it just do not get any better than this !
Flashlight	POS	5	this be the best , most usable flashlight I have ever use . get a bright color or silver so you can find it in the DARK . significant advantage over cheap throw-away light : - aluminum construction make it durable and beautiful . - great size for the hand - relatively light weight -lrb- but heavier than cheap plastic light ! -rrb- - Extra bulb hold within the flashlight ! - take two common aa battery - candle function . neat ! - focusable beam change from wide to narrow and bright . - come with a durable cloth holster . this be my flashlight of choice for around the house , toolbox , camping , and emergency kit . it be tough , reliable , and look pretty nice too . I do not recommend the camo design - it can be easy to lose if you drop it outside !
Flashlight	POS	4	I have a maglite on my keychain . I forget how old it be , but almost all the black paint be rub off leave bare metal . it still work on the original led . sometimes the twist-switch get gunk up , and need cleaning , but it mostly still work like new . I can not think of any design improvement .
Flashlight	POS	4	I buy this for my 18V B&D; flashlight . it fit a little looser than the orginal and I be a little worried that it would not work , but it work just fine . I have not use it long enough to comment on bulb life .
Flashlight	POS	5	I get one of these issue at work today because I could not find my normal use flashlight . I throw out the box immediately so I have to look up the multus mode feature online to clarify why the light be do what it be do . I really like these feature though . the 25 % brightness feature will help if you want to use the light in candle mode as the bare led be super bright and not suitable for light a table if the power go out . less bright equal more comfort in those situation . I can see myself use the flash feature as well . you could leave the light outside flash as a signal if someone be go to you house and could not find it , for instance . the SOS feature be a neat thing , I suppose , but I hope I never have to use it ! I have a mini mag aa at home with a lead conversion , but this one be much brighter . same mag quality you expect from they other stuff . if I have to buy this light , I certainly would . I be glad work give I one for free -lrb- go toolroom guy ! -rrb- but I want to recommend this product in case anyone be on the fence about it .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have this flashlight for literally over 25 year and it be go strong . I get it as a boy scout for campout when I be about 15 . it be not buy on Amazon since they do not exist back then ! it have survive many a camping trip and now that I be a dad myself come in handy around the house . always a great accessory to bring with you to check out those `` bump in the night '' - this bad boy double as a formidable club . I remember check out the different size from 3 to 6 cell and the 4 cell have -lrb- for I -rrb- just the right balance between weight and light output . I like it so much I just order a lead upgrade which be no longer manufacture by mag and cost about the same as a new light since it be in demand . financially not the smartest thing I have do but I want to keep this one go . sentimentality and loyalty to a flashlight ? only to a maglite !
Flashlight	POS	4	I sure do like this light . light be bright , and last a pretty good long time . the only thing that I do not like about it be that if you set it down on the battery , and raise the lamp up and point it down , it become unbalanced . but ... that do not hinder my use it ... love the light .
Flashlight	POS	5	Maglite be a little late get into the lead market , but this little light be a good value and the same maglite quality .
Flashlight	NEG	2	I be very excite to get this light ... initially , I like it . out of the packaging , I hook it up to the 18v battery and it work , emit a fairly bright beam . the sale ad say that it come with a `` extra '' bulb , which be not include . I email Amazon regard the issue and they send a 2nd light to my address , instead of send a bulb or two -lrb- ? -rrb- . it be worth mention the the re-ship do not have the extra bulb either . I have pretty much decide to just purchase the other light as well , think I could use one and leave one in the work truck as a spare . then , I be use one of the light , hit it pretty hard with a board I be use in a attic , and it fizzle . I go and get the other light , use it the rest of the morning , then go to use it in the afternoon and it be burn out too - with little to no abuse -lrb- that I can remember -rrb- . I send both of the light back - they be not as durable as they should be . instead , I order two of the flexible-head light -lrb- Dewalt 18V -rrb- . a few of my friend have these and have have no issue . I will leave a review for those as well when I have have time to put they to the test . all in all , this be a bright light , but if you put you equipment to the test day-in and day-out , it might not be the quality you be look for .
Flashlight	POS	5	Got this at Wally World for a little more than Amazon -lrb- last minute buy -rrb- for a camping trip . boy be I glad I buy this ! half we group be separate from we during the trip to the camp site and it be late . luckily I be the only person in we party that have any light for the first night and I use this to collect wood for a fire and get a fire go . ton of use for two battery and extremely bright and powerful for it be size .
Flashlight	POS	5	my company buy one of these Mag Lights and I didnt expect much from a rechargeable light . wow be I wrong , this light be better than any dry cell flashlight ever make . this be more like a spotlight on a police car with 50,000 candle power . we use this light all the time in a industrial enviroment where it get greasy a lot , and this have lead it to be drop a time or two , none the less it have never fail to operate like new . . the rechargeable feature on this light be so handy . we just hang up the light at the end of the day in its cradle and it be ready for hard action the next day ...
Flashlight	POS	5	this little flashlight have be a great help in many situation . I keep one in my purse and one in the kitchen drawer with the dog 's leash and drop it into my pocket before take my dog for walk at night . it not only light my way , but help I find the dropping as well as the key hole when I get back to my condo . the candle mode have come in handy during several blackout .
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be amazing ! you can use it for anything , and it will not break . my Dad have a old empty de-icer can in he truck , and it be make really obnoccious noise , and annoy I . so , I cave it in with my maglite . I have drop it countless time , and it be still fine . it can light up the house in the backlot behind we house , about 250 yard away . there be a squirrel that come into we house through the chimney , and wasrunn around we house in the day , when we be not there , and hide on the fridge when we be home . so , my mom see the cat sniff around the fruidge , and ask I to take a look . so , with my maglite , I look around , and there he be , the peice of vermin , sit on we fridge . my brother get a stick , and I be the light man . my brother finally get he out , and after 5 or 10 minute of chase the stupid thing , shine the light in he eye , he run out the back door . the flashlight play a big part in get the stupid peice of vermon out . after that , and after my sister handle it with filthy hand , it smell , so I wash it under run water in the bathroom sink , twice so it would stop smell bad , and it be still fine . it be definately handy if you be move , and you have a big messy garage , or to light up anything dark . if there be a power outage , the lamp mode be a big help . during previous power outage , my Dad 's tryed settind up flashlight all over the place , and it do not work . if you need a good flashlight , buy a 4 cell maglite . it be big enough to be very bright , but , unlike a 6 cell , it be small enough so that you do not a crane to move it anywhere .
Flashlight	POS	4	before decide to post this review , I decide to look over the review that be already post . I notice that many reviewer complain about low-intensity light and the relatively short battery life . well , I can see where they be come from . if you want a flashlight to use day in and day out , on every night you go camping , or to frequently navigate through a dark house , then this be definitely \* not \* the flashlight for you . why do I like it so much ? let I tell you about where and how I use it , and you 'll understand . I have be camp since I be a kid . back when I start , those giant flashlight that run on those blocky 12-volt battery be common . I have a few of those . I also have plenty of those plastic flashlight that run on d-battery -lrb- now those be true battery hog -rrb- . in time , I learn about MagLites , and begin use various model . for a number of year , I think I have settle on the 2 aa Mini model . it certainly be a great flashlight , but I find I need a flashlight less and less . as that happen , I start look for a small light I could carry `` just in case '' -- and the MagLite Solitaire fit the bill . I have be carry one for year now . you see , when I first start camping , or even if the light go out at home , I feel I need a bright , powerful flashlight . over the year I have learn , however , that such bright light serve mainly to reset you night vision . only on the most overcast and moonless night do I ever find myself really need a flashlight -- or when someone drop they car key in the back yard at the end of a long night around the fire . even when in my tent , I find that have a smaller light work out really well . it I need it on , it be bright enough to let I see , but not so bright as to disturb my tentmate . in addition , its light weight and small size make it a ideal backcountry companion . it take up alomst no room in my pocket , and hang comfortably from a piece of paracord around my neck . like its larger cousin , the Solitaire let you adjust the beam , from a tight focus to a broader diffusion . as some have note , however , the low light output -lrb- 2 lumen -rrb- be such that many may not preceive much benefit . I do find the adjustment useful , however , use the broadest diffusion when use the light for general illumination in a small space or dark area , and focus the beam when I be really try to look at something in particular . also like its larger cousin , the Solitaire will operate with the lens end remove in what be call `` candle mode '' . use that way , you could place the solitaire on a flat surface and use it like you would a candle . here 's where it really do fail compare to its larger cousin , however . on those model , the lens end be larger than the diameter of the shaft\/handle , allow the lens end to be slipped onto the bottom like a base , give the candle-mode flashlight a wider base when stand it up . since the Solitairs be the same diameter along its entire length , that be not a option . when I use it in candle mode , it be typically to quickly illuminate most of the tent , and I just keep the lens end in my off hand . the solitair be small enough that I can tuck it in between my hat and my temple , too , free both of my hand when necessary -lrb- like when try to fix my glass -rrb- . - I keep one in my tackle box , as a convenient light when need to search for some bit of tackle at dusk or after nightfall . - when camping , with the help of a little clip or piece of string , you can hang the light from a gear loft or a clip in you tent , give you a quick and easy way to light a central area -lrb- to play card , for example -rrb- . - I keep one on my key ring when I travel , just in case I need a little light to check something under the hood . - when hike , I always carry one with I `` just in case '' , even if I start out during the day time . while some decry how dim the light be , you would be amaze by how easy it be to spot even the smallest light during the dark of night . besides , but this little light up against a clear -lrb- or light color -rrb- plastic water bottle will illuminate all the water in the bottle , allow you to create a more visible object if you need to get someone 's attention . - I never use the light for more than a few minute at a time , so I have never have a complaint about the battery life . in fact , I be very happy with the battery life , and the fact that I can keep the same battery in the light for month on end without it drain down to nothing . while it be always best to take the battery out when not use it for a long time , I have have they sit in the Solitaire for a full year and still kick out light when I need it . - they make great gift . my wife and three of my kid each have one , and they all find they useful . a MagLite Solitarie be a great tool to put on a new driver 's key ring . -lrb- even better be to pair it with a Victorinox Classic Swiss Army Knife ! -rrb- - keep one in the glove box -- the small size make it really easy to handle if you need to poke around under the dashboard to replace a fuse . - put one in a mini survival kit . it be small enough to fit into many mint tin alongside other survival gear -lrb- e.g. , hook , line , match , razor -rrb- . as note before , a small light in the dark can often be see from far away . besides , in a survival situation , that light can be use to attract fish by dangle it in the water ...
Flashlight	POS	5	you can never find a bulb for the sear craftsman flash light . it blow they out if you bump the flashlight . waste time !!! spend a little $ get the DEWALT I have 3 -lrb- SEARS be way to much $ -rrb- Amazon have best price for bulb too ! 18 volt .
Flashlight	POS	5	I install these in the ` saddlebag ' of my Chevy Avalanche and they work very well . I actually use some special fastener from Lowes to use as I be install these in plastic . they have a very firm grip on the flashlight and it look like these will last a long time .

Flashlight	POS	5	no matter what size flashlight you prefer to carry or keep in you home\/car , buy a maglite . they come in all size , and for a few dollar more , you be get a flashlight that will survive anything and work when you need it . Trust I , you will make you money back in the long run . I only feel cheated because all of my maglite will outlast my lifetime . I be go to have to leave they to someone in my will .
Flashlight	POS	5	let 's get real : you will not find any better 100 % american flashlight for this price . consider the excellent quality of this product do it make sense to buy any other flashlight ? absolutely no ! some critic say batteri will not last . ok , that be true but you can buy 4 nimh battery and good charger for less than 25 buck and get hour and hour of light with this tiny marvel . lead flashlight have be around for some time but they cost 3-4 time a mag and -lrb- read it -rrb- the be not as bright with a pair of aa cell . besides most led be cheaply make in China . mag Lite still rock . any replacement for this american beauty will only come from MAG Lite Company .
Flashlight	NEU	3	the dw904 can be a excellent accessory to have , but I much prefer the Dewalt flexible model to the pivot type flashlight because they really handle daily on the job abuse better and also have the add advantage of a long rubber cover flexible neck to wrap around object for better positioning . my preference be base on heavy use of both type of the 12v , 14.4 v and 18v model . most of the flexible model I currently own be several year old and have have many time more use than the pivot model ever will , for a good reason . although they have be pretty well beat up , all be still work fine and I could never say enough good thing about they . the on-off switch on all model be fairly well protected but can occasionally get stick in one position because of heavy dirt or mud buildup . the switch can be free up easily with the aid of a stiff part clean brush once the mud have dry . if you do a lot of work in crawl space or other area where dirt , mud , sand and grit can get ground into the pivot joint of the dw904 flashlight , it can eventually cause excessive wear at the joint and damage to the spring loaded electrical contact located there , cause the light to malfunction without warn at a most inopportune time . one day , I have just such a experience use the 12v dw904 while replace the motor on a circulator pump located about sixty foot back inside a crawl space under a hotel . the crawl space have absolutely no area lighting of its own and none of the natural light that you sometimes get through vent , so the dw904 be literally the only source of light to be have . about halfway into the job , I be in the process of adjust the flashlight head to better light the work area , when everything suddenly go pitch black . at first , I think , ... okay ... , maybe the bulb have just burn out . I would have to change the bulb in the dark once before so I new it could be do . feel my way around the flashlight , I carefully unscrew the lens and replace the bulb with a spare bulb store inside the flashlight head . the bulb be not the problem . I remember think , ... `` Heeere Lassie ! '' ... because there be no way I be go to be able to navigate my way around obstacle and get out of the crawl space without see where I be go . fortunately , I have a two-way radio with I and be able to get hold of someone up above to grab another flashlight and come down to where I be work . I do not think this situation be bring about by any flaw or defect in the dw904 so much as that it be just not design for any type of use that expose it be pivot joint to continuous abrasion from sand and dirt . the older Makita 9.6 v pivot type flashlight I use year ago where also susceptible to the same problem , although none of they ever go completely and totally dead on I like the Dewalt do . you could usually bang the Makita against a floor joist a few time and it would come back to life , at least temporarily . overall , if you plan to use you flashlight only in clean , dry location , the dw904 should be a good choice . on the other hand , if you plan to consistently use you flashlight in damp , dirty environment and other high abuse area , as most tradesman normally will , then one of Dewalt 's flexible flashlight model be definitely a better and much more appropriate choice .
Flashlight	POS	4	there be not much i can say about a maglite that hasnt already be say its solid , durable , with excellent finish -lrb- the silver in my book be worth the lil extra that be my personal -rrb- . I purchase a lead replacement ` bulb ' that alone say I plan to have this for life .
Flashlight	POS	4	this little light be bright but right in the center seem to be a dark area ? it lose a star for the dark center , you would think the center would be the brightest but it be not .
Flashlight	POS	5	maglite have the best quality there be ! get it quickly and it be package well . price be unbeatable -lrb- i check -rrb- very happy with this product !
Flashlight	POS	5	machine from solid rigid aluminum , this be a small well design and well make metal flashlight that deliver a strong white light for only $ 11.75 . it take two aa battery by unscrew the end cap which have a rubber o ring to keep out water . it fit easily in you hand and turn on by twist the end with the light so it can no accidentally go on like some other light with switch or button . it be not a fancy ultra lead light like some more expensive one on the market and those have they place in you house , but with this one you get rugged , reliable bright light for just a few buck so you can afford to buy several and keep they in different place in you house or car for handy use .
Flashlight	POS	5	I be a maglite repeat customer , so I guess I have already know I would like this aaa version . I buy one to try , but i will be buy more to keep at various place around the house so that whenever I need to look behind or under something I have a light handy . they be tough , durable , bright and , because of they size , incredible convenient . mag have another win flashlight model here . I especially like the candle function .
Flashlight	POS	4	when you be buy a replacement bulb for you Ryobi lignt , buy high quality ... dewalt or eq . I have the factory bulb in my heavily used light for 5 year , then it break . the first replacement I buy -lrb- the cheap one -rrb- last a month before it break . I suspect these will go longer .
Flashlight	POS	5	experience coping with blackout lead I to experiment with lot of battery light -- fluorescent , lead , and conventional incandescent bulb . this 6 d-cell light provide the largest area and brightest illumination . here 's how I use it : I set it vertically so its beam bounce off white ceiling . I also use some handy household object as a base holder to keep it from tip . in the kitchen it provide enough light -lrb- while aim at the white ceiling -rrb- to prepare a simple meal use the gas stove -- and for wash dish afterward . later , in a 20 ' x 30 ' live room , it provide enough light bounce off the ceiling so that everyone could sit , talk , eat dinner , and see everyone else in the room . that be comforting & reassuring ! finally , in the bathroom & bedroom , this very bright light , aim at the white ceiling , provide enough illumination for showering and brushing tooth as well as allow two person to move around a bedroom without bump , stumble , or stub toe .
Flashlight	POS	4	the amount of illumination this small light provide compare favorably with that from a double-d-cell flashlight use a krypton bulb , which be probably what most folk expect from a general-purpose light . that say , compare one to another be tricky because of difference in the beam . a standard flashlight project a strong center spot surround by a broad halo of rather dim and often uneven light . however , with its much smaller reflector and led , the Mini-Maglite produce a strong center spot with a halo that be both much narrower and considerably brighter than its counterpart . therefore , one of the way I compare the two light source be to aim each at the white ceiling of a darkened room while observe the amount of reflect illumination of the furnishings . unlike the yellowish light emit by incandescent bulb , the LED in the Mini-Maglite provide a brilliant , white light that seem to be quite close to daylight in color temperature . it do not suffer from the distinct bluish tint common to many high-brightness led . the light output from this led light be much greater than that of the incandescent version of the Mini-Mag , which I also have . I measure initial current drain from a set of fresh aa battery at around 500ma , compare to somewhat over 300mA in the regular Mini-Mag . the company claim the light use a 3-watt led -lrb- as rate by supplier -rrb- , but it would appear that even with a new set of alkaline battery the actual energy use will not exceed half that rating . Furthur , my measurement indicate the power will likely decline by half again once the battery have start to become weak . of course , one can not expect miracle from two small battery and the reduction be likely a balance between high output and power usage . I would expect several hour of strong light , with slowly diminish output until the battery be exhaust . like the regular version , this mini-maglite be operate by unscrew the head slightly to activate a internal switch . furthur rotation will focus the beam somewhat as the reflector move outward . there be not a great deal of difference in the lead version , and very much twist simply reduce the overall light output . the head may actually be remove and use as a base to support the light in candle mode . this be make possible by the elimination of a lanyard like be attach to the tail cap of the standard Mini-Mag . as owner of several multi-led flashlight , I have learn that one big advantage to have a single led be the narrow , project beam it provide . that feature come in handy when you be walk at night and want to see some distance ahead . the light in the sp2201h package come with a holster for carry the flashlight lens-up on a belt or perhaps hang it from a nail . two Duracell battery be also include . I have read that other folk have encounter problem with the switch be intermittant , and I must admit that the flashlight do not work well with another brand of battery I install during testing . mostly make in the USA , the flashlight carry a limited lifetime warranty that exclude burnout of the led module . improper installation of the battery may destroy this item , so be very careful . if have a slender light that weigh less than a third of the typical flashlight , yet illuminate just as well appeal to you , then I think you 'll be please with the Mini-Maglite LED .
Flashlight	POS	5	my old black Mini mag lite finally die , so I be look to replace it . this -lrb- cheapest -rrb- version of the Mini mag be shiney silver , which I be now get use to after have the black one . it come with 2 Dura cell battery , a spare bulb , and a black weave nylon holster . there be a hole drill through the end cap to allow you to put a cord on it and\/or hang it on a nail , I guess . while it do not focus into a perfectly round smooth beam , it be round and smooth enough for general use . you can spread out the beam if desire , or even remove the head and use it as a holder for the `` candle mode '' - just the handle point up with the bare bulb on top - to , say , illuminate you whole tent for a minute . no doubt you can put a $ 15 conversion bulb in this $ 10 flashlight and make it a $ 25 flashlight , but why bother ? the only minor complaint I can find be the holster can not just slip onto you belt - you must thread you belt throught the flat loop . this could be a good thing as well , though . I buy two .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have mag light over the year and far as I can tell I will continue to buy they . I work as a handyman . I never know what I will be do from week to week . a good flashlight be worth its weight in gold to I . I have have my 2aa lead light now for just over 3 month now . it have be in crawl space , some of they dry . countless non light basement . I really like the fact you can reduce the power , use it as a strobe , SOS , or a regular flashlight . Great think on mag 's part . all in all , they be worth the money . if anyone be look for a great gift idea for just about any guy , this be it . ok I know there be a lot of gal out there that would think they be cool too . talk about a great stock stuffer .
Flashlight	POS	5	it be a AMAZING FLASHLIGHT for the size . it have the lite intensity of a ordinary twin d-cell fashlight and will LAST EVEN LONGER . the ABILITY to adjust the beam be fantastic and it be SMALL SIZE mean I can carry it with me constantly . high quality and value for the buck be it be BEST POINTS .
