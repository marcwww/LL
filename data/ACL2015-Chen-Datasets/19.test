Headphone	NEG	2	the lack of detail be annoy with these headphone . . a example would be while listen to a acoustic jazz album it be almost impossible to differentiate the cymbal from the rest of the instrument . .
Headphone	POS	5	in reality i give these a 4.5 since sweat destroy they . but thankfully I do not buy they for exercise . they have stay in my ear without any discomfort or agitation for several hour . sound be balanced , bass be full , and it come with a array of ear piece to ensure you get a good fit . if you can do physical activity without sweating these make be suitable bud for you , but otherwise you be look at a very short lifespan with wetness on these . though the cord and ear piece be design well the material feel a tiny bit cheap , so you definitely want to take great care of you set . you can easily do so by store it in the small case it come with . overall great sound , excellent design . if they make it in a sturdier material without change touching sound quality , I would happily buy that pair as well .
Headphone	POS	4	these be really good headphone . they be not the absolute best that money can buy but they be very good still . the Noise isolation be work well . the bass be pretty deep as long as you have the right ear cushion in . the smaller piece you have in , the better it be , and easier it stay in you ear . overall it be be a good purchase . pro : Audio quality , bass , noise iso . con : price , control talk control do not work on android , earbud be heavy and can fall out when walk .
Headphone	POS	5	I want to let everyone know that this be a great item . Perfect for work out or run because now you do not have to deal with the wire . I have never see a wireless set of headphone ! highly RECOMEND !!!!
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone have a excellent sound quality for the price . it have a deep bass that , in my opinion , be well balance with the high and low . I play bass guitar , so I tent to enjoy a bass that be a little more pronounced rather then be subdue . the headphone themselves , while large in size , be comfortable and durable . my wife stretch they to they limit to place this on she belly so we soon-to-be-born son can listen , and there be no damage or stretch on the part of the headphone . after have use earbud for so long , I be amaze at the nuance in my music and movie that I can hear with these headphone . great job Sony !
Headphone	POS	4	I fall in love with the design of these headphone . I really like the retro look , and I absolutely adore over the ear headphone ! I be not a big fan of stick ear bud into my ear . I think the red part be go to be metal , but its actually plastic , but that be not a big deal . the mesh ear cup actually provide pretty decent noise isolation which mean do not have to crank up the volume to drown out background noise ! I use these on my computer and the sound be very clear and very nice . I listen to music on my computer , since I dont have a mp3 : -lrb- , and so the sound be pretty balanced , but I be no music expert , so that my 2 cent worth about the sound . when I do plug these into a mp3 player , the sound be pretty quiet low . I be surprise . I have to crank up the volume to listen at a good listening volume ! this be mostly surprising because I absolutely do not listen to music at a loud volume because my hearing be important to I ! so I be pretty disappoint by that fact since I be plan on get a mp3 and would have like to use these . another thing be that if there be wind outside or a breeze , you actually hear the `` whoosh '' sound ! this obviously interfere with the music , especially because if you outside with these headphone it mean you be use a mp3 player , and if you use a mp3 player the sound isnt that loud anyway ! and for I , even if the noise isnt that loud I dare not crank it up too much because I do not want to damage my hearing , so that be disappointing . I love the look , the sound quality and volume be amazing when use on a computer , which be where I spend most of my time listen to music and what not . one other thing I notice about these headphone , after about a couple hour of use they , with break in between , my head start hurt a bit . I dont know if its just because of the pressure that the cup place on my ear -lrb- which really isnt much it doesnt squeeze you head ! -rrb- , but I have a small headache , and I dont ever get headache . overall I think these be pretty decent headphone for wear in door while work , play , or listen to stuff on the computer , but for outdoor usage I would not recommend it . Hope y' all find this review helpful !
Headphone	POS	5	they ship promptly , they do what you expect , and they be not cheap junk . ca not say it better than that .
Headphone	POS	5	i wash they twice by accident they still work . you wont be disappoint . love they so much the only downfall to they be that they sound just too loud sometimes but they be the best headphone i ever own
Headphone	POS	5	I have own the iGrado 's for about 6 month now , and after extensive heavy usage they be still work perfectly . the sound be phenomenal for a product that be intend to deal mostly mp3 file . with these you can easily tell the difference in music file that be 128kbps vs 320kbps ; thus , you be obviously go to want file with larger rate . as far as the comfort level go , the headband be not adjustable , but it form to my head rather quickly and have be comfortable for I since . my biggest problem with these headphone be actually the spot where the wire connect to the headphone , as they be constantly be bent when they be set down , put on , etc. . however , they have yet to show any sign of give out , so it might not be a big deal . Definatley a good buy .
Headphone	NEU	3	I think this be a update model of Sony mdr-ex76 . as Sony mdr-ex76 , this mdr-ex86 's sound be pretty good . it be quite natural and clear . however , one problem with mdr-ex86 be that it discomfort my ear because of its bulky phone part . after 3-4 hour of its use , it really bother the inside of my both ear . probably , my ear have a problem . because its sound be not greatly different from mdr-ex76 's sound , I still like mdr-ex76 .  Sony mdr-ex76 \/ blk ex Style Headphones with carry case -lrb- black -rrb-
Headphone	POS	5	this be by far the best pair of earphone I have ever have . my first pair break and I didnt hesitate to spend the ask price for a new pair . they be great for work out . they wont fall out and they dont hurt you ear like the other earphone do -lrb- after extensive wear -rrb- . also this be the best quality sound I have hear for the price and the size . its just perfect for I and it even match my pink nano ipod .
Headphone	POS	5	I be a drummer , and be look for some good , professional look and sound in ear monitor . I be think about spend $ 99 plus for a pair of Shure in ear 's . but then I find these , for only $ 17 !! they look so professional , like pro drummer wear these . for the price , they can not be beat !
Headphone	NEG	2	I buy Labtec 835 go by the revieww , but now i have stop believee review and specificationg ... , these headfone be bad , no real volume with clarity , sick bass , i mean only u can listen to something like a lecture ... ! good thing , these headfone be real comfortable ! but then pay 16 $ for that ??? pay a little more and get something better ! I didnt like these headfone at all ! if u r a music lover , u wont like they , dont buy they ! else u regret ...
Headphone	NEU	3	these be my first Sennheiser Headphones . I purchase they base upon the glowing review for they sound . I just also buy a pair of Sony 7506 headphone at about the same price range . the Sony 's blow these out of the water . the 7506 's have deeper bass , better imaging , extend treble , and be more sensitive . they also seem to mate better with my Yamaha receiver for impedance purpose . the Sennheiser hd-280 's will give you better sound than less expensive headphone , but both the Sony 7506 and v700dj model be overall better in sound , sensitivity , power handling , and distortion .
Headphone	POS	4	so I buy a pair and receive they today . I be happy with the packaging and all but all I be really concern about be that the `` l '' and `` r '' symbol be both write towards the inside of the little square metal piece -lrb- towards where the bud face you ear for each earpiece instead of towards the back of they -rrb- . I do not know if this be a indication that its fake or something , but the Beats symbol be also a little scratch . the zipper on my case have already have paint chip , also , be the warranty really 3 year ? do anyone else have the same problem ? do these problem indicate that these headphone be fake ?
Headphone	POS	5	it be so nice to listen to the song I like when I be on the computer and the T.V. be on next to I and I can not hear it .
Headphone	NEG	1	I get these as a sad gift - the overall sound quality be quite bad -lrb- when nc - noise cancellaton-is turn off -rrb- . not much low frequency and minimal high frequency content . so purely as headphone - they fall at the bottom of the heap . with nc turn on , there be some amplification of the sound - so it sound louder . the nc effect itself - well - its kind of work , but not much . probably about 20 percent of the noise be take care of . do not even try compare the performance of the bose to these -lrb- I do so - use a co-passenger bose qc3 - and it be a revelation - one work beautifully and this one barely do so -rrb- . I plan to get a pair of Panasonic RPHC300 now -lrb- since I do not have $ 300 to burn -rrb- . I be curious how the nc effect be implement for the left and right earpiece . there be no wire that connect the right side -lrb- with the battery and nc electronics -rrb- with the left earpiece . go figure this one out : -rrb- . I have some idea - but that would mean this be not a stereo headset . too lazy to experiment further with this piece of junk . the good thing be they fold quite well .
Headphone	POS	4	these headphone sound amazing for the price , way better than I expect they to . for 13 buck they be a steal . my only complaint be that they do not fit my ear well . I have average size ear , maybe even a little on the small side but for some reason they just do not fit right . my left ear feel pinch ... however it do not bother I enough for I to stop wear they . I use they w \/ my creative mp3 player and they sound a lot better than the earbud it come with . I like the volume control on the wire . overall these be great headphone , especially for the price .
Headphone	POS	4	these be a good replacement for the ipod ear bud , which I hate ! they do not cost much , they do not fall out of you ear and it do not bother I when I end up give they away to my nephew and neice , when they lose they headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	I be worry about the price , but these headphone honestly have a better overall feel and sound than my skullcandy . they have unique bud that fit very well in my ear and do a excellent job of cut out sound . I have now have these for a few month and they still work fine .
Headphone	NEU	3	we buy two pair of these and they work reasonably well of the price . sound quality be so-so , noise-cancelling be good , but the piece of plastic that hold the headphone open -lrb- when unfold -rrb- be go to break . we also have both pair lose sound in one sound over time . we do not treat thing roughly or use they all that much . anyway , while they work they be a decent deal and if you figure you can have five pair of these for the same price as one of the bose it might be acceptable .
Headphone	POS	4	the good : this thing do what it say it will do and sound pretty awesome . you will not use the full volume without do ear damage , unless you already have ear damage . it successfully take the underpowered Razor Maxx output and deliver excellent sound , while improve the range -lrb- bass . -rrb- the Bad : I do not know how they define `` normal use '' , but 10 hour be a pipe dream . I be lucky to get a hour out of it at perhaps half its volume potential . if they make a bigger one that hold a bigger battery , that would actually last 10 hour ; I would pay 5 time the price in a heartbeat ... and probably 10 . that be say ; this thing be still worth every penny they be ask for it , as the price be very fair for what you actually get .
Headphone	NEG	2	well like a lot of the other folk who have post , this be a really great service . I be surprised there be not more product on the market like this . the manufacturing and design of the headphone however be severely lack . after only have this product for 5 month , the back of the headphone have crack . I just get off the phone with the customer service folk and as long as you have the receipt they be refund money and not replace they at all . I think there be too many fundamental flaw with the design .
Headphone	NEU	3	we purchase 25 of these headphone for a computer lab at we school . for the most part , the sound be decent , and they be relatively comfortable for the price . we select this model because of the affordability and the reduce likelihood of anyone want to walk off with a pair due to the rather clunky and unattractive design . -lrb- and to that credit , none have walk off yet . -rrb- however , we have now have to dig the end of the headphone jack out of five computer , as five of we pair have break off inside the computer audio port , simply from regular plug and unplug of the headphone . so , they may save you money in the beginning , but I would highly recommend throw they out after a year and buying replacement so you do not risk damaging you audio device when the 1\/8 '' jack break off inside of they .
Headphone	NEG	2	the headphone be fine . the microphone be awful . it twist away easily and really do not have enough heft to work unless you hold the piece up to you face while talk . it be a real disappointment . note the audio control do not work on my android phone or MacBook , which I think be suppose to have the same control as a iPhone . you may want to double-check its compatibility with you phone .
Headphone	NEU	3	I have own this pair of headphone for a year now and I would say that these be worth the purchase . I be write a review now because after a year of use , the right headphone finally snap off . even consider that , these headphone remain worth the price . pro - great sound quality ; Clear and handle bass really well that can otherwise be inaudible . - tight ; if you be in a loud environment , these will definitely make sure that no outside noise leak in while listen . - cord ; very long , conveniently wrap around , and very unobtrusive when wear the headphone . con - headband strap be incredibly flimsy ; the plastic inside of it appear to crinkle and crack to adjust to you head 's shape in a unflattering manner . the strap 's connector to the headband be make of fiber and very prone to twist . this cause I to fumble around with they every time before wear to twist they back into place . - screw be not tight ; somehow , one of the screw on the left headphone fall out a while ago . the headphone manage to remain attached , however . - uncomfortable after heavy use ; I use my headphone daily for many hour at a time and I experience soreness after remove they . - ear pad ; very prone to collect strand of hair and debris and be not easy to clean . they do remain removable , however , as I have remove and place they back on a few time before . - durability ; if you plan on use you headphone frequently for extended period of time , I do not recommend these headphone because of they cheap build and discomfort .
Headphone	POS	5	very fast shipment . excellent sound quality , great bass . slick cord . fit great . look durable , let 's hope it be . really great sound for the price .
Headphone	POS	5	the Sennheiser RS140 Wireless Headphones be phenomenal . we have 2 headset on one charger . I set the television volume low -lrb- or even mute the tv -rrb- and my husband and I adjust we headphone to we individual comfort level . they work in every room of we home so I can prepare dinner and not miss my favorite show . in addition , the sound be crisp , clear and enhance . it be a wonderful product and I highly recommend it . this be not just for hear impaired .
Headphone	NEG	1	these bud do not flex at all & be way too big for my average size ear . the sound be okay for the price , but they hurt to use !!
Headphone	POS	4	I agonize a few day over my new selection - so many option . sound quality be so subjective . I mostly ignore that aspect in review , but I will say that `` I '' like the quality and find it superior to any of the dozen or so sub $ 40 bud I have use -lrb- and lose -rrb- . I be surprised and pleased with the quality of the low-end part of the spectrum . the other element I be after be `` tangle-resistance '' . these be so resistant , they may be make of a yet-undisclosed state of matter , solid , but ... ; -rrb- they also be very comfortable with a good isolation seal of the ear canal . the dark red color of the the cable and the nice little case may help I hang on to these for more than a year ! the only niggle I can cite be the `` rasp '' of sound conduction via the cable as it move on you clothing . however , I consider this to be minor and be expect with tangle-resistance . all in all , a good value .
Headphone	NEU	3	pro : - sound quality much better than the amazon price - loudness - fit comfortably on ear , adjustable a bit con : - build quality be poor - pad feel thin\/cheap so that be about it for I .
Headphone	NEG	2	the shape of the ear bud take a lot of get use to . there be more comfortable over-the-ear model available than this .
Headphone	POS	5	just get these pair of headphone for my office , base on my husband 's recommendation . these be light , comfortable and very good quality , suitable for long duration use . one of the problem I have face with some other headphone : 1 . too big to fit on my head and keep dangle . 2 . Start hurt my head or ear after some time . 3 . audio quality suck . these have a snug fit for head of any size and do not hurt or irritate at all . love they .
Headphone	POS	5	I have have these headphone for 2 year now . so you people who Broke Yours in a Month or less do not take good CARE of THIS PRODUCT . I be a DJ and Use these and the over the ear Solo beat Headphones both Great Sound and Quality .
Headphone	POS	5	I love music and have buy really expensive head phone that be not as good as the px 100 . they be the best head phone for the price . so much so I buy a second pair to work out in . yes I be a audiophile geek and I be very critical about my sound . no 128 bit rate for I I need 320. : - -rrb-
Headphone	POS	4	the most important thing by far for wireless headphone be comfort , and these really excel in the comfort department . I can wear they for hour and not feel like I want to take they off . the comfort seem to be from three factor : 1 . they be relatively light weight , 2 . they have a wide foam pad that rest on you head around the ear , not on the ear , and 3 . they do not clamp down on you head too tight , just tight enough to stay on . the only comfort issue be that they be big and bulky enough that you can not lay the side of you head on a pillow with they on like you can with in-ear headphone . seriously , do not buy uncomfortable wireless headphone no matter how great they seem otherwise . I have very high standard for sound quality as a person who build my own high end speaker , and I can definitely say there be headphone that sound better , include my wire mdr-v6 headphone . the main problem be that the bass be weak . from midrange up to treble the sound be very good , and most people would be very satisfied with it , include myself . but the reception be great ... as long as any part of the headphone have line of sight to the receiver there be no cutout or static anywhere in the living room . of course as soon as you leave the room the ir signal cut out . the surround processing be not very good . just like most DSP mode on receiver , it make for tinny distorted sound . maybe it do steer the sound somewhat but the overall degradation be not worth it . I leave the headphone in music -lrb- non-surround -rrb- mode even for surround source because it give a cleaner sound . I live in a condo , and even though I have higher quality speaker , I find myself usually use these headphone for movie and tv because it be just so cool to be able to listen loud enough that you can hear all the dialog all the time with no concern about annoy the neighbor . listen through the speaker I be always turn the volume down during explosion or crash and turn the volume up during quiet dialog . with these headphone you do not have to do that so you be more immerse . most people seem to think the surround processing on these be pretty much state of the art and yet I think it be useless . so my suggestion would be to not buy headphone for surround processing . just find a pair of comfortable headphone that have decent sound quality and you 'll be set . since these headphone cost so much due to the surround processing , they be probably not a great value . the other minor complaint I have be that there be no way to turn the base station on or off remotely ... it be the only device I have to actually get up and walk over to turn on . after a few year of use , mine be develop a problem where the sound cut off if I leave my dvr on pause for a long time . this use to happen just a few percent of the time but now it be start to happen almost half the time that I do a long pause . the problem seem to be in the base unit ; unplug the toslink and switch the base on and off restore the sound . I be in the market for a new set of wireless headphone . I be consider get another set of these use to replace the base unit , and that way I 'll have two set of headphone so my girlfriend and I can listen together late at night without wake other up .
Headphone	NEG	1	anyone say these earphone have a good sound must have very low standard ! they have absolutely `` no BOTTOM END '' at all . I DJ for a living and play all type of music and can appreciate good sound quality . these have neither good sound quality , nor any bass at all . I do not expect they to have the same sound quality as a $ 200 pair , but these do not even compare with `` stock '' earphone , let alone aftermarket . I actually think someone have be mess with my mp3 player and turn the bass off . to my surprise , the bass be turn all the way up . I 'll admitt , I do love a good rich bass sound , nothing muddy or `` boomy '' , just bass and drum the way they suppose to sound . these earphone do not even have the slighest hint of bass as far as I could tell . they do not impress I in the upper end either . mostly all I hear be mid 's . Kinda like the sound that come from a cheep alarm clock . well I guess I 'll keep try until I hit the `` SWEET '' spot that I be look for . maybe a good pair of shure or ultimate ear eb or pro . but you can rest assure , it will not be another pair of sony 's .
Headphone	NEG	2	you would imagine this one should be better than the original one , but in fact , the noise cancellation be so poor my wife instantly decide to return it . bose qc 15 be more expensive , but it do a much better job cancel the noise .
Headphone	POS	4	unlike what some people be complain about , I get the item that be picture . it also work as advertise for my LG Cosmos . there be only one problem I have with this adapter : the connection be finicky . sometimes if I twist the plug on my phone jack , I can hear the sound go rather quiet . so , either the jack on my phone be bad or the wiring in the adapter be not the greatest . regardless , it be only a little over a dollar and still work pretty well so I be not really complain .
Headphone	POS	4	I use these for run with my ipod - the cord be a little short but the sound be quite good and I find they more comfortable than bud when I be sweating .
Headphone	NEG	1	I can not believe these get the kind of review they get . they sound horrible on every level . the earphone that come with my ipod so outdo these it be pitiful !! do not waste you money !
Headphone	POS	5	these be order for a gift and I end up keep they for myself . the sound quality be wonderful . do the stylish case , they be easy to pack and take with I when I travel .
Headphone	POS	5	First of all these be very very high quality build headphone , thick plush leather , strong dense aluminum . they be over the ear head phone , and be very snug and comfortable . I have hear of people say they hurt , that be a total lie unless you have huge ear but my ear fit perfectly inside the cup . I would buy these again and again . they be the best dre headphone out there . they be $ -lrb- ... -rrb- with shipping , but I guess I have they now , lol . they be very expensive to what I really think they should be sell for but they be worth it if the Studios be $ -lrb- ... -rrb- . these be total show stopper and have a very clean sound . I have use but not purchase one over $ 1000 but they be for more of a recording purpose type of headphone . these be truly a great product but think they will require alot of juice to run off of a ipod . again these fit well on normal size ear .
Headphone	NEG	2	the headphone work really well out of the box , with better sound quality than the earbud that come with the iphone . however , I experience malfunction of the volume control after a indoor run on the treadmill -lrb- 10k -rrb- ; perhaps some moisture get into the wiring ? after dry , it again become functional . a rather unexpected problem , since one of the tout quality be water resistance . outdoor running do not seem to cause the same problem . it happen again after a shorter run -lrb- 5k -rrb- , again on the treadmill indoors . I guess the sweat get into the control stick and temporarily render it nonfunctional . overall , I get less than what I expect from a rather pricy headset .
Headphone	POS	5	the j3 Micro earbud be fantastic . to anyone look for some great earbud look no further the quality of theses earbud for the money be unsurpassed . I will be buy another pair of these just to have a spare . great job jlab . oh and to anyone talk about the tiny sound . learn how to put they in you ear , it make all the difference this be the case with all the micro earbud I have try , they must be seat in you ear properly .
Headphone	POS	4	I love anything by bose , but the price for these headphone be not mark down from the list price -lrb- the bose site have they list at the same price that Amazon consider `` discount '' -rrb-
Headphone	NEG	1	just after 3 month the on\/off button break down , shortly after the button lock feature stop work .  before this , when I put the unit in my coat pocket , at the slightest movment it would turn itself on , if the button lock be not on . so , if you be not consiencious enought to put the button lock on each time , expect to burn through a slew of battery .
Headphone	POS	5	I be not a headphone snob , I be just look for a great headphone at a good price . the cord be very nice and flexible and they come with a bunch of different ear adapter ... take the time to get the fit right . the fact that there be a case be great ... the fact that there be no winder or some way to constrain the cord in the case be a minus . but I do not expect to get a case ... so I can not downvote on a extra . the best bass I have ever experience in a in-ear headphone . tl ; dr buy they , they be good .
Headphone	POS	5	I be a keyboard player who have play in many record studio over the year and these headphone be the one I usually see . they be reasonably price and re-produce accurate sound rendering that represent the sound you actually hear with no add fluff . I would highly recommend these headphone to anyone who appreciate a good , solid piece of equipment that will last a long time .
Headphone	POS	5	I just order these from Amazon and receive they yesterday , they work great . battery take about the estimate time to charge , 16 hour . I hook they up to my tv and be able to listen from in front and off to each side a bit , even with the transmitter slightly obstruct by a speaker stand
Headphone	NEG	1	not a good product . difficult to keep tune to the television , and the battery would not stay in place . I would not purchase this product again .
Headphone	POS	5	I get two of these , the first with a great discount . but my brother like it so much , that I order a second set right after receive and test the headphone for some day . they be comfortable , quite light , and sound really great -lrb- I can not listen to videos\/music in youtube with these because it just do not make the headphone justice -rrb- . this be my first time buy `` brand '' headphone , and you can really hear the difference !
Headphone	POS	5	when I first open the box on this headset I think how cheap it feel . but after use it I be glad it be light . do not be fool , the Sennheiser quality be there . I be totally hooked on this headeset now ! I just wish the battery be cheaper and time will tell how long they really last . also still not sure why Amazon be sell additional headset for this setup at a higher price .
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be a very good value . they block noise very well , and the three earbud size should fit pretty much anyone . the sound be noticeably better than my fifteen-dollar set I have be use and I have find that I be able to pick out lyric or melody in some song that I have not notice before . the behind the head cord might annoy some but I be use to it and I find that it help the headphone from be tear from you ear or catch on thing . the headphone themselves be very small and sleek look . the packaging and shipping be my only complaint , as there be virtually no way to open the dang thing without a heavy duty scissors and a lot of effort . the shipping take a little longer than I would have like but that be not the fault of the headphone ! Sennheiser say that they come with a 2 year guarantee warranty , although I have no idea how this would work since I order they from a third-party . hopefully I will not need to figure this out . overall , a great value and I use they everyday . they be stylish , comfortable and sound great .
Headphone	POS	4	sound quality very good , noise isolation slighty better than original . they stay in place much better .
Headphone	POS	5	these be work fine for I . I can not believe how great the sound be . as to the bass , I just put these to the `` bass '' test . one of the most demand track , in my experience , be the song `` one '' by Metallica . you know that part just before Lars ' double bass kick in ? well , there be very few speaker that can handle that , especially with the volume and the low end bass turn up . I may have hear one pair of speaker in my life that could handle that part of the song without distortion , and those be 100 watt 3-way speaker with 15 '' woofer . well , I just listen to that part on these headphone with the volume up about as loud as I could stand , and with the low end of the equalizer turn up almost all the way , and guess what ? no distortion !? I still can not believe it , but I just hear it with my own ear . these thing really do go `` inside '' you ear ! in fact , I would say to be careful that you do not shove they in there too far , or too fast . and be careful pull they back out . you have only get 2 eardrum , so do not be reckless with they . to the person who complain about `` too much bass '' distort the audio , do not you mp3 player have some sort of equalizer ? I would think that almost any mp3 player would have at least a 5-band equalizer ? -lrb- as far as I be concerned , any mp3 player should have a 10-band equalizer , but I guess we can not have everything . -rrb- one complaint : there be no volume control build into the wire . I have buy much lesser headphone that do have that feature , and it be a shame that they do not include that feature on these , but , oh well . I see they be on sale now for $ 3 . oo !? wow , now that be amazing ! I think I be get a amazing bargain because I only pay $ 7 . oo for they !
Headphone	POS	5	these head phone be very nice and comfortable . the sound quality be great . when you first take they out of the package though they look like guitar head phone at the end , like they would plug into a amp . or something but you just take that off and it plug into anything else like a ipod .
Headphone	POS	5	I buy these for my son a he just love they , I put they on myself a they fit very well seem very sturdy a the sound be great . a as usual with Amazon you can expect fast ship a excellent packaging .
Headphone	NEG	1	delivery date be Dec 20 . no sign of it and no option to contact the seller on my account . help ?
Headphone	POS	4	the noise cancellation be not as good as bose . but it cost so much less and get you most of the way there . the audio quality be passable , as people have note it be much quieter with nc turn off but nothing that the volume control on you media device will not solve . I also do not have problem with noise leakage , in a office setting with workstation whir on desk , you can not make out sound at 1 foot from the headphone . you mileage may vary with ambient sound and volume of music .
Headphone	POS	4	i have to return these after one day because they be huge on the ear . there be no way to adjust the headband , so it keep fall off my head . i get irritated so i just return it . sound quality be pretty good , but i didnt have they long enough to say anything else about this .
Headphone	POS	5	this be my third pair . I love these . the price be great , the sound be also really good . when it come to ear bud , often time the bass be really lack . the bass in these be outstanding .
Headphone	NEG	2	when these in-ear headphone be properly install -lrb- and get they in right be like a installation -rrb- the sound be amazing . I have hear part of song that I would never hear before . but the headphone suffer from two massive flaw . the first be that if the headphone move the tiniest bit out of you ear canal , the sound quality plummet . this be a huge problem because the cord be so long that it be guarantee to catch on something and jiggle the earbud . even when wrap up and out of the way , the cord will respond to the slightest movement and pop the earbud out of you ear . this be extraordinarily frustrating , all the more so because the sound be so good . I do not recommend these headphone to active people or to people that plan on move much at all . if , however , you do not plan on move much with these headphone , you be golden . also note : that little case that come with they should be use all the time ; the earbud piece will come off in you bag or pocket and the case help prevent that . it also help prevent just whipping out you ipod and listening , since you have to undo the case and store it , but that be the least of you problem with these headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	these pone be a excellent value and have a great sound for listen to audiobook .
Headphone	POS	5	it be great especially for the price . I enjoy this earbud .

Headphone	POS	4	I be first introduce to what we now call the 71EX series by a good friend from Beijing who let I borrow hers : I fall in love and have to get a pair when I make my first trip to Japan . those be Fontopia N.U.D.E. ex70 series - soon to be replace by the 71ex with less clingy cord and more trim head -lrb- same driver\/innards -rrb- . in short - these bud be pretty awesome . since that first pair , I have own two other set -lrb- 3 total -rrb- , due to rain , a washer , and a washer\/dryer run respectively . here be a breakdown : - comfort : the top . Easy to sleep\/nap in - its entirely possible to forget you be wear they . still , inner-ear bud be not for everyone . if you be new to this style , give these a fair chance to get use to em ' before declare they uncomfy ; -rrb- . - isolation : Great . effective enough to avoid use these while driving\/cycling\/attending a lecture . very nice feature when try to take a nap or otherwise tuning out noisy surroundings . - Inexpensive ... certainly a plus as you will not break the bank if you break em ' or decide inner-ear bud be not right for you - sound quality : Fair mid , crisp high , and strong but somewhat muddly low -lrb- i.e. rapid bass drum hit will sound more like `` thummm-thummm '' than `` thmp ! thmp ! '' -rrb- . if I have to rate these on sound quality alone , I would probably give these 3\/5 star , but the above benefit bump it up higher , and be the reason I keep buy the same bud even after accidentally ruin they multiple time . in summary : a highly recommend introduction to the world of inner-ear bud . great way to try the style out without diving head-first with you wallet . for a step up in quality\/price , search amazon\/google for cx300 -lrb- ~ $ 30 -rrb- , ex85\/ex90 -lrb- ~ $ 60 -rrb- , V-Moda Vibe -lrb- ~ $ 75 -rrb- . also recommend study up at the ilounge headphone forum - invaluable resource for nonfanboy observation regard these and many other model .
Headphone	POS	5	it only be a month but so far so good . sound great and look very durable -lrb- a must as my headphone usually do not last long -rrb- . fantastic price especially as i have they ship to the UK . well worth it !
Headphone	NEU	3	this headphone have very good audio quality but after 5-10 minute it be very uncomfortable to wear . I be start to have headache on the side of my head above the ear after that time . I have have it for the past 12 month and now I dread wear it . I be 5 ' 9 '' with average size head . try this before you get this . it do not stretch with time .
Headphone	NEG	1	the sound be awesome for the short time they last . wire come away from ear bud .
Headphone	POS	4	just Super Sound come form this small device . I use it when I travel on the airplane and discover I do not need the bulky expensive noise cancel headphone . with the ear plug nicely place , all you hear be great sound , and its easy to carry around . definitely recommend it .
Headphone	NEG	2	no matter how the sound quality be , I think this headphone be very uncomfortable . I originally want to get the Boss oe2 , but go for this because it be much cheaper . but I do not like how it feel when I wear it .
Headphone	NEU	3	I have purchase this brand in the past and have be very happy with the sound and durability . I use these to listen to my mp3 player while work out and the fit be perfect . sadly , the connection from this pair to my player seem to create more static and the sound go in and out during listen . because they be so cheap , I do buy two pair and will switch to the other pair soon . hopefully , it be just a glitch in my current headphone and the other pair will function as other have in the past .
Headphone	NEG	1	the connect point where the hook go into the headphone be loose , so they do not stay in place very well . the sound quality be ok , but because it wont clamp onto the ear well enough I lose a lot of sound definition which make it sound pretty crappy overall . my primary problem with headphone be the cord that connect to the mp3 player stop work because it rip at the base of the plug . I buy these about 3 month ago and the where the cord connect to the metal plug have completely come undo . I think it may be because I wrap my headphone around my mp3 player before I put it in my pocket . but nonetheless , this cord do not last near as long as some of the cheaper headphone I have purchase .
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be perfect . they fit in my ear , block out other sound in the room and they stay in place when I turn my head . -lrb- my other ear bud keep fall out . -rrb- and the sound be excellent . I can hear every instrument and every word ; so clearly that I now realize some lyric I be sing incorrectly all these year . would definitely recommend these to friend .
Headphone	POS	4	the review from some people on this site have I concern that upon use my new headphone , the cable would turn to jelly and the product would become worthless . that have not happen yet , and I be loving these headphone . they block noise out with the snug fit , and they sound great . I enjoy listen to all type of music , especially track with intricate , bass heavy beat , like those of Kanye West , for example . I be hold onto my warranty , which I believe be 2 month . so far , so good .
Headphone	POS	4	really good investment . they work extremely well , do not hurt my ear , and I do not have to pay too much . if the price seem to good to be true , trust I , it be a good deal . I get it within a week , and I have have it 3 week now . no problem .
Headphone	NEG	2	I have to turn these thing forward at a 45 degree angle from how they be picture to make they hold on to my ear . otherwise the bud do not even rest in place . the audio quality seem fine . before I use they regularly , I just have to decide whether I feel ridiculous go out in public with these thing \* look \* like they be fall out , as it be the only way to actually keep they from do so .
Headphone	POS	4	I get this headphone about 1month ago . just 99 $ , it be a good deal , but it doesnt work good with mp3 player or ipod , you need a headamp for this headphone . when i use with home theater system , it easy to drive this headphone . this headphone make treble so good , mid be ok , and bass be very strong . THIS be a good deal for 99 $ , but you need a headamp to drive it
Headphone	POS	4	the ar Wireless Headphones have good reception thoughout my house . it do start to get some static in my back yard and in my garage but other than that it work good . the headphone do fit comfortably on my head , they also block out most of the background noise .
Headphone	NEU	3	I buy my Triport headphone nearly a year ago , and mine have hold up well , but I have have to be \* very \* careful when I handle they . the sound quality really be teriffic -- excellent frequency response across the entire spectrum , with a `` warmth '' in the bass that be miss in every other set of headphon I have -lrb- admittedly , none of my other headphone cost as much as the Triport -rrb- . in general , these headphone be comfortable to wear , and the foam rim around the phone mold to you head , do a great job of block outside sound . at time , the thin headband become uncomfortable ; I find I can wear these thing for about a hour before the top of my head become sore from the pressure of the hard , narrow headband . as other here have point out , the construction of these thing be extremely shoddy . they look and feel like a $ 10 pair you might pick up at Family Dollar . the cord be dangerously thin , as be the headband . these be definitely not heavy-duty headphone . the connection where the headphone cup connect to the headband be begin to crack on mine -- it be only a matter of time before they 'll need tape reinforcement . because they be so flimsy , I never take mine out of the house . when I want to listen to something walking , jogging , or otherwise `` on the move , '' I take my sturdier Sony headphone , even though the sound be poorer . I use the Triports mainly for listen to music or movie at home when I do not want to disturb other in the house -- for that they do a decent job . it be a shame that for what these cost , they could not be better make . if you be prepare to spend this much for a good set of headphone , think twice before buy this set . for the same price , there must be better-built , decent sound headphone out there .
Headphone	POS	5	I write computer hardware review for devhardware.com and I have the pleasure of write up a full review on these headphone which can be find at http:\/\/www.devhardware.com\/c\/a\/speakers\/sennheiser-px100\/ needless to say they be definitely worth the money . for less than $ 40 you will not find a better sound set of phone .
Headphone	POS	4	this be a good product for the price offer . although many people do not use these type of headphone anymore , I believe this be a good choice for use at home . I tend to have problem with the earbud be too big or constantly fall out , but these headphone be good to go when you hood they on you head !
Headphone	POS	5	sound quality be quite good consider the item 's low price , bass come through great and the headphone only fault be show when music be at a very high frequency for a long period of time . the cord actually do prevent tangle , be a decent length , do not hinder music when rub against clothing , and look good . the purchase also include a great compact carry case which hold several size of ear bud -lrb- 5 pair in total -rrb- . once the proper seal around you ear have be make these headphone will sound great and provide a amazing value for all sort of buyer highly recommend .
Headphone	POS	5	I have a hard time with headphone . these be great - there be a plethora of option for the ear bud portion and the over the ear part be mold-able ensure that they stay on you ear regardless of the shape and activity . if only they be waterproof .
Headphone	POS	4	my wife love these headphone . I have work in loud environment my whole life , so my hearing be not as good as hers . she use to constantly complain that I have the tv , or music too loud . while sometimes I would use a cord headphone , it be too constrict . the sound quality of this set of cordless headphone be on par with the high end cord headphone I own -lrb- bose -rrb- . while I do not get the range that other seem to get , I enjoy be able to get up and move around without be tethered to a cord . I be not a audiophile , but I do enjoy my music and will not tolerate hiss etc. . my wife have use these several time and want to know when I be get she a set . well I finally order she a set . I hope that be able to use the one docking station will be easy to pair the second set with . will update when second set arrive on ease of use to set with one docking station .
Headphone	POS	4	the sound of the equipment be excellent . Controls be not easy , too small . if I bow the headphone will not hold in place . refer to the Sennheiser Wireless headphone r 120 pURCHASED THRU AMAZON
Headphone	POS	5	this be a damned good set of earbud for the price . good sound with decent amount of bass ... moldable to you ear . you really can not beat this thing . under $ 20 ?? come on . . buy it already !
Headphone	POS	5	just get these today , but I shop around for some time , I have the Studio beat for a couple of week , and decide they be not worth the price . . these go well , for the average audiophile . . if you be look for some durable , good look , and good perform headphone , that be comfortable . . there be no better choice ... I really hope v-moda continue make product of this caliber , as I be very impressed with the pair I have ... and they be not overprice . . if you have a need for headphone and have a extra 100-200 buck to spend . . get THESE , you wont be DISAPPOINTED .
Headphone	POS	5	I purchase these headphone to use while work out because I be tire of the ear bud that come with my ipod and other cheap ear bud fall out of my ear . these be amazingly comfortable and be very secure in the ear . as soon as I put they in I be very impressed . it be easy to figure out how they go in the ear and easy to change the provide tip to find the right size . there be also a small clip on the cable so I can clip the cable to my clothes so it do not bounce around during the workout . the sound quality be a amazing upgrade compare to the headphone I have be use but I be compare they to very cheap headphone . this be my first pair of nice headphone ever so I be not able to provide a comparison to other brand . I be concern about they durability , base on some other review , so I will update my review in a few month .
Headphone	POS	5	I never realize how much a pair of better earbud could do for the quality of music . Bass be full and clear and I can hear thing I never hear before use the earbud that come with the ipod nano . great buy for the price .
Headphone	POS	4	when I get these first , they be excellent ! Philips have not let I down before . the sound be rich with great bass , but I will say that they hurt my ear for about a week . after that I get use to the feel of they . as for durability , they last about a year , now there be only one phone working . of course , if I fiddle with the wire I can get both work , but I can not bring they anywhere anymore . I really do like these though , so its a pity .
Headphone	NEU	3	these earbud look awesome , but they will not stay in you ear very well . I buy the earbud for my wife and she say they be too heavy and when she move a little bit they just fall out . she have try the different size of ear piece it come with and none will hold they in . if the earbud would stay in I would give this product a 5 - star rating due to the fact that when she do not move , they stay in , and sound great .
Headphone	NEG	2	someone give I a cheap pair of noise cancel headphone from Radio Shack , and I figure I could do better , so I buy these JVC headphone . the retractable cord be a big selling point , and I do like that feature a lot , although it be very hard to find the switch when you be ready to retract the cord . I also want smaller earphone , and several people mention these be good for smaller ear -lrb- which mine be -rrb- . I find these to be very uncomfortable . they be bigger and clunkier than the Radio Shack headset I have , and they be really tight . they really pin my outer ear down -- I could not find a way to adjust they that make they feel any better . the noise reduction feature do work pretty well . no complaint about that . I play a dvd on the plane and could hear even the softest dialogue just fine -lrb- with the volume turn all the way up -rrb- . however , they be not significantly better than my cheaper headphone in that regard . because of the discomfort and overall `` clunkiness , '' I be return these headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	as a Headphone nut , I find these great for a reasonable price . a little bit of static occasionally as with all cordless headphone . these be comfortable and not too hot for longer use .
Headphone	POS	5	Wheeeeee . have be enjoy the v80 since two week . love they , love they !!! so happy they finally arrive and be able to try they out . the senn hd 598 be my first decent over ear headphone and I think they be the best until I get the v - moda . I do not know what exactly cause the great sound -lrb- the dual driver maybe ? -rrb- because otherwise it kind of go against logic -lrb- cause the senn have bigger driver -rrb- but the v-moda 's sound clearer to I : s. I also have the akg k 701 for at home and yeah , those be more analytic\/detailed and be also very dreamworthy still , but the bass on the v-moda kick they ass any day . and when I compare all three , the senn somehow lose badly , it sound the loudest\/muddiest and bassiest -lrb- but in the bad way -rrb- of all . before I have the means to compare , it be not that obvious !! I think the 598 be the cat 's ass . anyway , the v moda be the ultimate portable solution , even though they be on ear they do get comfy after a while after adjust to you ears\/head a bit , I be surprised -lrb- have a not fully heal industrial pierce on the right I be fear the clamp -rrb- , but I be very happy with that , I do feel it , but it be not really a pain in the ass . in conclusion : the headphone sound great , even better than I expect after read all the review . no tinny cavern sound as I read somewhere but a big ! clear moderately bassy sound , and the treble be not very pronounced but I like that , since modest treble be less fatiguing\/head-ache induce . as for the look : I must say the fact that they do not look huge and be very very pretty + true blood edition -lrb- oh yes yes -rrb- also be reason to buy . when they arrive somehow the look dissappoint I though , but only a bit , because the picture build up impossible expectation haha and I think it have something to do with the chord be a bit flimsy -lrb- in comparison to big headphone - not to other portable -rrb- and the gray black not fitting the red of the v 80 completely . still , I have get over it . they somehow look very steampunk\/similar to advanced technological artefact from the past . they be very beautiful in they own punk way though and fit small head . anyway : aesthetics : subjective and de gustibus ... I do like they a lot , the earcup be ideal , the headband maybe could still improve as far as look be consider , comfort be ok . as for the customize : I would love to , but very impractical since buying\/sending from USA to EU mostly give grief . Customs tend to keep stuff + extra shipping cost . any belgian ppl here order custom shield ? I would love to hear if it go well or not ? oh , also why do not the eternal life warranty include the EU ? : -lrb- . so sad . anyway . if the m-100 will sound even greater , consider another body turn . I also hope that the v-moda will hit the european market in retail shop too ... will they be available in Europe ?? so we can look and try it out maybe instead of have to rely on internet buying ? I would do it either way , but my preference go to be able to try it out ! Afterthought : no burning in effect imo . second afterthought : venus vidi vici be total win . Latin -lrb- 3 .
Headphone	NEG	1	I run . I sweat . I be not be pay by Philips corporate headquarters to write this review . I too have spend somewhere in the hundred try to find that perfect , do not slide out of my ear after a mile , with good sound quality headphone . well sadly enough , these be not it . the sound be embarrassing -lrb- which be not why I buy they -rrb- , the headphone start to slide as soon as you be ready to run some distance , and you might be think : how do a pair of headphone slide when they be ear clip on ? low and behold , this set have manage to do so . and once they have start to slip , it be over ... it be all over . in my experience , there be no way to get they comfortably back on , even if you have dry they . the sound be even worse than before if I even bother to dry they mid-run , they wont fit snug again in my ear if they have to be take off mid-run , and they have this ridiculously long cord , long enough to hang myself out of frustration . I always know Philips make crap electronics , but I be willing to try anything , I have about ten or fifteen pair and they be all lame . the best pair I have have , have be a Sony pair , that be not even sport edition , or waterproof , or anything -lrb- they be however expensive -rrb- . if you be consider buy this product , I would keep look , there be better choice out there , although more expensive ... consider what you will spend on this pair and then another pair , and spend about that amount to begin with . or just by a pair of cheapo Skull candy headphone , they be about as sport friendly as these . good luck . sorry philip , I have to tell the truth .
Headphone	POS	5	First off I would like to say that these headphone have amazing sound and construction quality , also the comfort be suprisingly good . lastly I have a question about the break in period . do I have to play the headphone at a low volume to break they in ?
Headphone	POS	4	the sound these put out be nearly unimpeachable . I be use they with a Ray Samuels Audio Predator usb dac\/headphone amp , source by a modify HP Tablet PC -lrb- usb -rrb- and a ASUS Transformer Prime -lrb- analog out -rrb- and get good result . the sound be relax , detail natural , although I think the high be a bit roll off . I would not use these straight out of a low power source . I do have a couple of con - first , as some other reviewer have point out the attachment of the can to the headband seem flimsy - it do result in unsurpassed comfort for a headphone this large . the finish on the mahogany earcup be less than superb . the cord be long and heavy and make the phone unsuitable for portable use and less than optimum even in home with a ipod or tablet - they be design for use with a headphone amp , a control amp\/processor or receiver . as the headline for the review note , these be make in China , which be a disappointment when buy a luxury grade product from a japanese manufacturer . give my experience with the limited lifespan of most chinese make electronics , I wonder what they longevity will be . if I have pay full price for these they would be go back . I do have to say kudos to Amazon for a great price and fast prime delivery .
Headphone	POS	5	I buy these headphone after read the review and the good rating . all I can say be these headphone be probably the best headphone I have ever own . the sound be phenomenal . I sometime use they for watch movie on my laptop the sound be so good it sound as if I be at the theater . music the high , mid , low come through very well . for the price you cant beat it . these headphone can go for much more than what they cost .
