Flashlight	POS	5	please see my review on DeWalt DW 9043 bulb , as most of that apply here . bulb work great , but run very hot . Lens very hot , after 2-3 seconds touch , reflector about the same . metal hinge\/holder too hot to touch . some plastic smell in first 10 minute inspection . check again at 1 hour 5 minute -lrb- total test time -rrb- and still the same . no scorch or melt plastic . a winner ... UPDATE april27\/12 : still work great with normal drop and bang , lens heat not a issue ...
Flashlight	POS	4	early this summer I add 2-aa and 2-c maglite lead flashlight to my hurricane kit . they perform exceptionally well for I over a very stressful four day without power during and after Hurricane Ike . the 2-aa model amaze I with be everything I need to get thing do 90 % of the time . I sleep with it on my belt for four night and it be on my belt during daylight hour too . the tendency for it to fall out of its holster can be solve with a heavy rubber band loop a couple of time around the sheath to add tension . for a week after my power be restore I continue to carry that little light on my belt , because my friend or neighbor power might not have be restore and it be easy to carry and handy to have . I have bond with the little flashlight and will always recommend it . although I have since add a 3-aa maglite lead to my stable and would probably recommend that light for folk that be only go to have one good flashlight around . 12-8-2009 Update : mag-lite have new and improve they 2 aa lead light , and I just happen to have one . subjectively , it appear to be 20 % brighter than the old style 2 aa lead light . it also have a 25 % power mode which will allow it to burn continuously for over a day . the blink and SOS mode be nice , but I doubt the average person will ever have a call for those function . although the old style 3 aa led be brighter than the new style 2 aa lead , the 2 aa be handier to carry and the low power function have I convinced this be the most useful flashlight to have around . this be the most versatile flashlight I own . I have up my rating on it to five star if I know how .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have own and use mag light for year they be very reliable and put out great light . I love the way the beam on the flashlight be adjustable , you can zoom in or zoom out with ease . it let you see whatever you want with bright light . Heavy enough to be a very good weapon in a pinch . this one we keep here at the house for emergency power outage , or to look around outside at night . they be great to have around for this purpose . I also purchase the hanger to attach it to the wall in the garage . very easy to install and let you place it in a handy spot so you can get to it when you need it . we have several around the house . they always work replace the battery once a year , more often if you use it a lot . it will work for year .
Flashlight	POS	5	maglight flashlight be the best you can buy ! I pull mine from my totalled car and work without a hitch . if you use a flashlight a lot or hardly ever , this be the one to buy . -lrb- and no I do not work for the company ! -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	I really like this little mag-lite . it be a perfect size to keep in my pocket , or in my glove box and be plenty bright for my need . you just can not beat the quality of mag-lite !
Flashlight	POS	5	seem more powerful than the original flashlight that come as a pkg with the drill . nothing like have the pivot head !
Flashlight	POS	5	I have be use some form of the DEWALT 12 volt flashlight for the past decade . as I find the DEWALT 12 volt drill a excellent choice for residential & commercial electrical work , the dw904 pivot Head Flashlight make for a perfect companion for you lighting need . it also provide a handy load to fully discharge the drill 's ni-cad battery allow they to recharge to maximum efficiency ! a great supplementary device for all ! Update : my DEWALT flashlight take a accidental tumble from 8 foot high and a hard crash to a hardwood floor . Thought sure it be a goner but the unit come up shine bright ! tough little mama !
Flashlight	POS	5	candle mode light up a large room . the LED light be incredible . i keep one in my car and one in my house . it be just awesome . buy this flashlight and you will never be sorry .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I buy three set of these . Broke one side of one clip pull out the flashlight two day after install they in my jeep . I have two more set so I change out the broken one . same deal when I pull out the flashlight and break the other of the first set two week later , and replace it . consider the price I just chalk it up to poor manufacture . yesterday i pull the flashlight out and break the side off of another one . I will remove these clip from my jeep and look for something more dependable . I want to mount a light in my jeep , rv , and my truck , but these clip be way too brittle to be dependable . I have one brand new set still in the packaging but I will not be mount they anywhere . I expect a lot out of my tool and maglite make a very high quality , dependable flashlight . I be disappoint to see this quality do not extend to this product . the plastic be too brittle for this use .
Flashlight	POS	5	we have use these Dewalt 12 volt flashlight for many year now , what I love be they be so handy , easy to use . you can recharge the battery and the battery can be use with other tool . they be very durable , drop they many time . I 'll stress the 12 volt , it be sufficient and be lightweight , go to a 18 volt and it get kinda cumbersome to lug around .
Flashlight	POS	5	product arrive fast and protect well . I will for sure do business again . flashlight be actually brighter than my maglite 2 d cell . I will be order the lead upgrade to increase the brightness even more .
Flashlight	NEU	3	the Mag Instrument S3D016 Black Heavy Duty 3 D-Cell Flashlight be another of my past favorite that get a lot of use . now a day , there be a lot go on with the technology of flashlight . LED , Lithium battery , focus bezel , etc. . the maglight brand have fall behind a bit technologically , but be still a great flashlight for minor emergency not involve look for criminal , terrorist or signalling for a chopper pick up . the Mag Instrument S3D016 Black Heavy Duty 3 D-Cell Flashlight be perfect for a tool box but a bit too big for a deep pocket . the product be very durable and they be prove reliable . do not get I wrong . I have depend on mag lite of all size for year . but head to head , the surefire brand have quickly surpass mag lite in every important aspect of flashlight - usable light power , size , durability and weight . the mag light brand just be not keep up with the new technology . and that be too bad for we who value product loyalty . the Mag Instrument S3D016 Black Heavy Duty 3 D-Cell Flashlight be still a good value and I have several in the house and the vehicle . but they be be replace by surefire as they wear out .

Flashlight	NEG	1	the shipping be as much or more than the product . I order it with other dewalt product but it be ship from a seperaye company
Flashlight	POS	4	the switch stop work in my Mini Maglite AA . I buy a replacement switch over the internet and fix it , and then I find out that Mag Instruments would have send I a new one free under the lifetime warranty . too bad . the problem be that the light turn on erratically if at all , and do not focus properly . if you open the top , you 'll see that the bulb be stick into a washer-like receptacle which they call the Upper Insulator Receptacle . it be print `` do not remove . '' if you remove it , by prying it up with you thumbnail or a pocket knife , you 'll see the switch assembly underneath , with a triangular-shaped sheet metal slide contact . remember how the slide contact go , because it be likely to fall out . if you remove the battery , you can take out the lower insulator too . that slide contact be what fail on I . instead of be flat , the radial arm be bent . I think that if I have flatten it out with needle-nosed pliers , that would have fix it , at least for a while . anyway , the `` switch Repair kit '' come with the most idiot-proof detailed illustrated step-by-step instruction that I have ever see for any piece of equipment . they even give you a plastic `` tool '' to insert and remove the switch , if you be the kind of person who have trouble tap a flashlight onto a table without lose part , or you do not have a pencil lie around the house .
Flashlight	POS	4	the flashlight be brilliant , literally . once it be charge for the first time it be unreal . and for occasional or rare usage it be extremely practical . but , if you use it for several hour a day , you may find that it take too long to get a full charge back into the battery . in fact , the only chance you can get it to fully charge be over the weekend . two battery ? how can you charge the spare battery pack when it have to be in the flashlight -lrb- which have to be in the charger -rrb- to recharge ? mag Instruments be apparently work on the problem , but to this date they do not have a rapid charger , or a charge cradle for a battery pack only . you could of course buy 2 flashlight and use they on alternate day . rather expensive though .
Flashlight	POS	5	ZBATTERY.COM be SELLING THIS ITEM for $ 19.95
Flashlight	NEU	3	have a 2 cell aa mag for 25 year , and decide to get another one and stage it at the other end of the house since power go out frequently in this area . I buy the lead think it would be ` much ' brighter and more powerful . it be not . compare both , with new battery and bulb in the old mag , the LED be only 10 % brighter with its whiter color light . it do project a perfect beam without distortion and illuminate a bit better outside . Quality be up to mag standard . supposedly , the battery last longer , but it will have to save a lot of battery and bulb to justify the cost . if you use it ` very ' frequently , it may be worth it . if not , the old style be just fine . I do prefer the slightly smaller size of the standard non-led mag .
Flashlight	POS	5	great flashlight , it remember I when I be young . I do the purchase for a experiment , hope lead maglite exist .
Flashlight	POS	5	bought 4 of these as stock stuffer and do not realize what a hit they would be . we have they tuck in glove box in we car , tool box , kitchen drawer . just small enough to fit into small storage area but not so small they get lose . the light produce be great . a very handy tool that I buy on a lark and would not be without now .
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be well build , big and heavy . just like my junk . if I hit someone on the head with this flashlight they would be a do Tom turkey . just like my junk .
Flashlight	POS	5	... it be big , it be a mag light and it really work when you need it . I purchase the sturdy clip and install it inside we key cabinet , so when we need it we just grab it , the key and go
Flashlight	POS	5	it be exactly what I be expect to arrive . I have slightly modify mine with bright pink tape so the boy at work will refrain from claim it as they own lol . .
Flashlight	POS	5	work better than I expect . Super bright , easy to hold . brightness do not diminish with use as with my incandescent . last about 5hr of continuous use on a fresh pair of aa 2500mah rechargeable .
Flashlight	POS	4	mag light be awesome . I have a 3 d-cell light for year , and replace it with this 4 d-cell . however , it be a bit to heavy to easily swing around as a weapon . buy the 3 d-cell light .
Flashlight	POS	5	can not beat it . I have have one that have be in use for over 20 year . the light be bright . the maglight be make to be use . I purchase this one for another location .
Flashlight	NEU	3	in the last decade , people have be root for this small flashlight that be always consider to be cool , with it be aircraft aluminum ` armor ' , and bright beam . this thing be once consider to be more popular than a lightsaber .  these quality stand to this day and should be consider should you buy this as a gift or lighting tool for someone . it be strong reach beam fire a fair distance in spot mode , and a moderately effective flood mode light up a room quite nicely .  now , with these kudos , there be some thing to keep in mind when buy this light :  unless you get silver\/puter or light blue , this black knight can be easily lose in the dark if you do not have it on . also , the fact that it be a heavy duty metal do not help it be chance from a fairly tall fall . this thing be not shock absorbent . maybe it be case be , but it be innards be not . and to top it all off , this flashlight be more thirsty for battery than a 5 litre gas guzzle Mustang . after a good half hour , it dim a litte , but a little too soon .  so , what do I recommend above the Mini mag ? two great recommendation : the Energizer double Barrel ` xenon ' flashlight , with it be great look , and better battery life . the xenon bulb be also brighter than the mag 's ` t-bulb ' . another great light be the Rayovac AA Industrial flashlight . now , this flashlight do not have the same distance reach as the Mini mag -lrb- in spot mode -rrb- since this light be build with a ` wide spot ' , that act like a super -lrb- and I mean super for a aa light -rrb- minus spot light , and maybe not at long distance , but at least for light up ... the WOODS ! I find this to be the best light for when you be lose in the wood . if you be one of those people who walk a lot at night , especially near any forest and wooded area , then the Rayovac AA Industrial light be the one-if you be not interested in a l.e.d light , which should be you first choice . you would probably think that a Rayovac AA flashlight would not be powerful enough for to light up the thick of the wood in the night and twenty foot in front of you ... well , guess again !! you would better get one and try it out . it be output be nearly as bright as a 2d maglite in flood mode . really ! I carry it everywhere with I -lrb- knapsack -rrb- . and mega shock resistant !!  so , hat off to mag for a great run , and for make a cool and powerful light with a few self defeat fault .
Flashlight	POS	5	I once put my 3d cell black maglite flashlight on the closet shelf and i be leave the room and i hear a thud i go to turn on the flashlight and to my surprise it still work
Flashlight	NEG	1	I expect more from this light have purchase many of Streamlight 's excellent product . the so-called beam be ringy and irregular and the bulb dont last very long . too many other modern light available that be a quarter of the size and weight that easily out perform the mag Instument line .
Flashlight	POS	4	this flashlight be great it last forever ! sturdy and bright , it also doesnt suck the life out of battery like many do . it take 2 double a battery . i have a red , light blue , purple and a black one and they have be amazing to have when camping , around the house and in the car . small and lightweight yet extremely durable . make out of metal that doesnt rust and the color be beautiful , i hope you enjoy
Flashlight	NEU	3	Maglite be a good flashlight for the price . but what I want more be , 1 . smaller & lighter 2 . much more brighter & focus beam 3 . lead instead of halogen\/xenon for longer life . only after see `` wolf-eye pilot whale 1000 luman '' , I realize that led can be so brighter . there be a lead upgrade option available for magcharger by  terralux tle-300mr ministar30mr 600 Lumens LED upgrade for Mag Charger Rechargeble Flashlight  see it in action video -lrb- ... -rrb- also all Magcharger model be have same luman , only difference be the ac\/dc\/europe charger , spend some time search that . also check  Stream light 76811 polystinger d lead flashlight with 120-volt ac , black  top bright led flashlight be also available from these brand -lrb- some of they available in Amazon -rrb- wolf-eye ultrafire eagletec fenix . Hope these help someone try to find a brighter flashlight

I take it on trip without even bring the charger . it be one of my favorite tool . the battery do not leak and it be ZERO trouble . I recommend this light and battery pack for everyone . portable , rugged , dependable and very useful .
Flashlight	POS	5	this review be for the 3 aa battery lead version -lrb- currently amazon have the title and description of the aa lead model mix up -rrb- . I have no less than 10 maglite in several size and color ... this one blow they all away ! to give you a example of how bright it be : in candle mode this flashlight be brighter than my fluorscent camping lantern that use 8 size d battery . this thing totally outshine comparable maglite more than 10 time its size . every automobile should have one of these in the glovebox , and no camp-box be complete without one .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have this system since 1991 and my flashlight stop work , so I check and order this one and now both maglight that work flawlessly . the charger on my 1st one finally go south only take 14 year . if you want dependability and longevity do not think about it , just buy it !
Flashlight	POS	5	the sp2201h be a lead upgrade of the former incandeecent Mini Maglite . the lead beam be very bright and adjustable by turn the head .
Flashlight	POS	5	to start , I be a tradesman who have to carry he lifeline on he belt . not only on the job , but I be also the unnofficial handyman of this apartment complex . every time I even move to take my workbelt off , it seem to be a signal for a neighbor to bang on the wall say something be on fire or will not open all the way . and the Mini mag be the universal flashlight . it be sell everywhere , include this fine site and even family store , and despite its legendary quality and design , be at the most ten dollar with include holster . I prefer the classic aa design , where CA not you find aa ? I have use one of these on my belt for about four year . it be a excellent tool , and I have never have one wear out on I . the bulb , however , be the Achilles heel . the rest of the flashlight be military , police and trade quality , for civilian price . but these dang bulb go orange after a couple week and last a couple month of casual use . I be consider shell out forty buck for a small led , just to save the money on bulb . then , walk through a sport outlet , I pass the flashlight section . and next to the usual Mini mag with holster , which I own close to six of , be a Nite ize accessory design for this same flashlight . a lead bulb . now , I have see these online for about twenty to thirty buck , and this be a ten dollar flashlight ! but this one just sit around on a shelf be eight buck , about a buck less than the flashlight 's shelf price . what the heck , I get one . to quote another review , my trusty old mag be now a state-of-the-art torch , with nearly triple battery life of the old bulb . and led , as all mag-hater know , do not burn out or even go out when bump . so , for a total of twenty buck , you get a american-quality led beam that compete and plain out whip fifty-dollar import with plastic casing . I would not recomend this flashlight if there be not there be a way to fix its biggest flaw . just get you hand on this led adapter , and put it in like you would the standard bulb . replace the mirror reflector , and stomp the old bulb into powder . you will not be need they , ever again . there be also a combo pack availiable , for the same price , that include a push-button adapter if you have ever wish you could tap a red button on the end instead of twist it on and off . I have not try it , but it come with the LED , and for eight buck ? and hey , the flashlight itself come in six different color . these thing be easily replace if one get bang up or you room-mate\/girlfriend draw all over it with sharpie while she be on the phone . I have have these work perfectly even whenhe asing h be through Hades and back , but some prefer a more formal-looking flashlight . just take the lead out and put it in the new one , those bulb last forever . and now , so will this flashlight .
Flashlight	NEG	2	I still do not understand how Maglite can make such great flashlight , and yet make a horrible single cell key chain flashlight . I have use maglite product for year . they be incredible sturdy , and yet beautiful to behold ! I have try to tell they , but they do not seem to listen , or care . I keep buy they , think they 'll get better , but they do not . like other have say , they be not very bright and they use power rapidly . and they flicker . I really do want a small flashlight for door lock and the like , but this definitely not it . DO BETTER , MAGLITE !
Flashlight	NEG	1	these be cool once , but by today 's standard the light output be very poor . my surefire and Arc flashlight be much brighter , more robust and a fraction of the size .
Flashlight	POS	5	I carry a aa mini-mag I have a 3-d cell in EACH car and a 2 6-d cell in the HOUSE one upstairs and one by the front door for self defence .
Flashlight	POS	5	these hold extremely tight . I hang flashlight vertically and only use one clip per flashlight . it be plenty secure .
Flashlight	POS	5	to start , I be a tradesman who have to carry he lifeline on he belt . not only on the job , but I be also the unnofficial handyman of this apartment complex . every time I even move to take my workbelt off , it seem to be a signal for a neighbor to bang on the wall say something be on fire or will not open all the way . and the Mini mag be the universal flashlight . it be sell everywhere , include this fine site and even family store , and despite its legendary quality and design , be at the most ten dollar with include holster .

Flashlight	NEU	3	after buy these as a replacement for a old pair I have that break a while ago . I be very skeptical due to the bad review . but I be sick of my flashlight not be available at the garage door where I originally place the clip . so I plunk down my money , re-install the bracket and now very carefully -lrb- know how they will break again -rrb- put my maglite in place and remove just as carefully . Buyer beware but still a useful tool .
Flashlight	POS	4	bulb work Perfect in my Milwaukee M12 Flashlight . just wish bulb be brighter . still cant figure out why Milwaukee dose not make a bulb .
Flashlight	POS	5	my husband and I buy we first maglite almost two year ago , and its still work like its new . he use it nightly at work . he can get about a week to two week usuage out of it before he have to charge it . we buy the second for home use because we get tire of buy battery for the small maglite you get from wal-mart . we love we new rechargable as much as the old one . I buy it about a month ago and use it about once a week . I havent have to charge it once . the only complaint I have have about maglite be that the button on the first one have fall off but it be still work fine other then that .
Flashlight	NEG	1	once upon a time these be consider top of the line , mostly by law enforment that actually prize these light because they be sturdy and they could bash people over the head with they . they be prize more for they club like appearance than the actual crappy beam that come out of they . over the year I have discover numerous company that actually try to make a better light , Surefire , Streamlight , Pelican , and Arc , to name a few . these newer light use newer technology , new xneon bulb and no bulb in the case of the new lead base light . it be too bad that maglite have be leave in the stoneage of lighting product and now from a competitive standpoint must use other means of compete . from recent observation mag have choose to try to simply place lawsuit against they competitor to try to destroy these new line company out of existence . sorry for the rant folk but no discussion of mag can be do without mention they extremely distasteful business practice . so I say to mag , spend you money on research and development , improve you now pitiful light and let you product be you ultimate statement of company direction . fire you vast team of legal expert who continue to be a blight on the civilized world and welcome competition which you apparently find so repugnant . so for anyone who bother to read this , frequent the company I mention above for superior lighting product and boldly step into the 21st century of lighting and see how delightful it can be . the bonus be you can still use you old maglite as club and weapon which they be design to be .
Flashlight	POS	5	get to the point . it be a great accessory to have . I own one in the past . I recently purchase another one through true value\/promax back on 11\/18\/09 . after I do not receive what I order by the estimate delivery date ,12 \/ 10\/09 I contact Promax and they tell I it be deliver on 12\/2\/09 via FEDEX . I be give the customer service number for FEDEX and when I call they , they tell I the package be deliver on 12\/3\/09 . I think I would save money by order the Maglite online , but instead I be rip off . a representative at Promax state that since my order be only $ 106.00 , they be no signature require and my package be leave at my front door . in that case , I would have do better by place the $ 106.00 on the porch with a sign that say , `` take I , I be FREE '' . the people at Promax be give I the run around in resolve this matter . I just want to inform other consumer on my experience Promax . I have call and leave message , and no one be return my call in regard to this issue . regardless of how much a item cost , there should be some alternative to make sure that we as consumer get what we pay for with we hard earn DOLLARS . thanks Promax , for show so much concern toward you customer , Joseph , who will never do business with you company again . what a rip off ! again , this item be a great accessory to have . I guess I will flag down a snap on Tool Truck to pay another $ 150.00 to get this great accessory in which I need it to perform my job .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a really good light . it stay in the charger so it be always ready to go . focusable beam be a great feature . it be very bright .
Flashlight	POS	5	it be a Maglite , and it live up to the reputation of its american brand . it be solidly build and work well . this thing will probably last a lifetime . scroll through the color option because you may be able to find the same flashlight for nearly half the price in a different color . I purchase it with the `` MAGLITE AM2A016 Mini AA Flashlight Accessory Pack '' so that I could attach the red filter and use it for stargaze .
Flashlight	POS	5	if you want a super heavy duty flashlight that can also be use for self defense then this flashlight be for you !
Flashlight	POS	5	these clip be great . make out of a very durable plastic , they be very easy to install . I mount these in both my truck and now have very easy access to the maglight and now free up room in my glove box .
Flashlight	NEU	3	I like the light - it put out a great beam , it do not weigh much , it seem to be sturdy enough ... the problem I have with it be it tend to turn on when carry in a pocket . to turn it on , the head be twist . when walk around with the light in a pocket , which I need to do for my work , movement tend to turn the light on . I have run through numerous battery this way , and of course , battery always need to be replace at the most inconvenient time .
Flashlight	POS	5	at less than $ 10 deliver , these Dewalt bulb be a fantastic value . they be the direct replacement bulb for my Porter Cable 12V Xenon flashlight . the Ace Hardware store that I order from have super fast shipping . the reviewer that give one-star because of the shipping cost must not value they time or think anything of bure up gas try to located these at a mega home improvement center .
Flashlight	POS	4	some reviewer disparage these clip because they be plastic . I have to look closely at they to make sure they be plastic since they feel very sturdy to I . I attach they to the frame of my futon in a couple of minute and now feel better know that I have a light handy without even have to get out of bed . I plan to get another set , or two , to mount a light near the garage door and maybe even in my suv .

Flashlight	NEU	3	the AA Mini mag be a reliable tool for everyday use . here be the pro 's : it be compact size and the sheath allow you to carry it anywhere you go . if you drop it nothing will happen to it -lrb- unless of course you abuse it -rrb- . the lens scratch easily , but they be inexpensive to replace . the lightbulb be also inexpensive should the original blow out . the head quickly adjust from spotlight to floodlight , and it be quick conversion to candle mode make it a unique tool , especially during a blackout or natural disaster . its compact size also allow you to use it in tight space such as check the back of the refrigerator , wash machine , or in you car 's engine . the con 's : the light be not too bright , it just do not hack it if you be picky about illumination . of course the xenon bulb be better than the type you 'll find on a $ 1 Dorcy light , and many other cheap flashlight . but if you have use Streamlight , Inova , Surefire , or even the new 3-watt led maglite , you 'll be disappoint by its brightness . if you be willing to spend some buck , you can upgrade you Mini mag to a 1 Watt LED light , which will provide twice as much light . you can also buy the switch that allow you to turn it on at the bottom with a simple click . there be some pretty cool thing out there that can turn this tough , reliable flashlight into something better ! however , it be still not appropriate for law enforcement , military , security guard , etc. . it would be more appropriate for everyday household use , walk the dog at night , or light up the room you in during a blackout . this flashlight usually range between 8-15 buck depend on where you get it from . if you spend about $ 25 buck -lrb- which would be roughly the same amount you would spend to upgrade the minus mag -rrb- , you can buy yourself a 2aa battery , 3-watt Mini-Mag Lite with a holster that will surely not leave you disappointed . it be light output be tremendous , and it be sure to blind you or anyone who look directly onto it . it also travel further . it also save battery life . it be not you average led-light , it be better and at a affordable price . so you might want to give that other flashlight a try if you be picky about the brightness of you flashlight . Hope this help !
Flashlight	POS	5	I have own a dozen of these small lite over time and they be great as hunting light to get to the tree stand as well as go from the garage to the house late at night . awesome power from such a small light .
Flashlight	POS	5	sturdy , bright and well build . Maglight have a eye for quality . the 3c cell be a nice size .
Flashlight	POS	5	great product , have be use mag lite for year and finally wear out my AAA light . but happy to pay the price to have more year of good service .
Flashlight	NEU	3	I order a flashlight for Father 's day and expect it in a new package like the maglite c cell flashlight I order but it be wrap in newspaper . the piece that detach at the bottom be in a old ziploc bag . the flashlight look pretty new but I have never receive a package like that . I will be order another flashlight soon but I wonder how its go to be package .
Flashlight	POS	5	3 pound , extremely durable , bright ... what else could you need ? caution : this item be strong enough to be consider a weapon , either as a lightsaber or beater stick , it will fracture skull with little force . rapist beware ...
Flashlight	POS	5	this be the highest quality flashlight on earth . not just this model but the entire product line . I think Mag Instruments have perfect the flashlight . you could spend you whole life buying and toss cheapo flashlight 's or buy a Maglite once it be that simple . Dont blow you money on plastic junk Stick with mag they really be the Mercedes Benz of flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a great flashlight . Maglite make a very tough light and hold up well to anything you can throw at it . this be the second one I have have . the only reason I get a new one be the battery leak in the old unit and I could not get they out . I would highly recommend this to anyone .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be one product -lrb- apart from a swiss Army knife -rrb- that will never fail you . go ahead and buy it .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I be very dissappointed with this item . do not last a day . the Streamlight Adjust-a-Clamp be vastly superior . stainless steel construction and it be CHEAPER too . my current streamlight set have be in heavy constant use in my truck for over 15 year . the rubber have wear off a few time but it still hold my flashlight ! customer who be unhappy with the mag instrument product should check out the streamlight clamp .
Flashlight	POS	5	maybe you be a cop or security guard , maybe you be a guy who live in a place where you can not carry a firearm , maybe you be just someone look to fill the ` use of force ' void that exist between shooting someone the bird and shoot they between the eye . any way you look at it , let not beat around the bush here ... anyone buying this light be do so for one reason only , the ` light ' aspect be totally secondary to that one reason . it be a club that double as a flashlight . so , how do we judge it on the objective criterion ? as a whuppin ' stick , it definitely work - so well that some ` kinder , gentler ' Police Departments do not even allow it anymore . Kind of a bummer that they discontinue the thinner 6c ; bar find one second hand and pay a real scalper price for it , the 5d\/6d be the pretty much the only ` in production ' option in the mag line for a `` big defensive flashlight '' but that be ok . unless you have very small hand , the 6d be perfectly controllable . it be big . really , really big . the light itself be about 19.5 '' long - a foot and a half - in total . when weight down with cel , it be heavy , too . you will want to tread lightly with this , as it definitely would generate enough striking force to fracture a skull , break bone . be damn sure you be legally justified to use it , if you ever do use it . you can hurt someone with it . it be do cut a pretty intimidating profile . walk around with one , it be almost as if you be carry a bat . in some situation , this be ok . in other situation , where draw attention to yourself be not the desire outcome , you would definitely want to leave this one home -lrb- in this regard , probably worth note that give its weight , this be essentially a two handed club . I be a large guy who have decent enough work strength - swing a six d-cel flashlight with one hand be pretty slow go . slow enough that you might risk you adversary grab on to it -rrb- as far as brightness , it be bright by ` bright enough ' standard . not bright enough to impress flashlight geek who obsess over marginally relevant technical detail on internet forum , plenty bright for average Joe to use for real world stuff . unless something have change , these be still ship with incandescent bulb , which be not anywhere near as bright as a good led -lrb- for example , the Maglite 3d lead torch be significantly brighter -rrb- ... of course , let we not forget the reason we buy this in the first place . the ` flashlight ' part be a secondary consideration , or , a primary consideration inasmuch as it allow we to carry it around in place where the same thing absent the flashlight function would be consider a unlawful bludgeon or club . if you want to juice the light aspect up to balls-out bright , terralux make a upgrade that turn the thing into a portable sun ... it be pricey - three time the cost of the light itself - but it do add a monumental upgrade in brightness -lrb- 700 lumen -rrb- , which can be quite practical . if you shine that into someone face , they be either turn away , or , if they be really determine to keep advance , they 'll be do so blinded and\/or with they eye close , at which point we option the ` club ' functionality . I do not throw around the five star rating too often , but this be a five star piece . right now , as of October 2010 , with Amazon free shipping on purchase over 25 , you can get one ship to you door for right at 25 buck . be this worth 25 buck ? hell yeah .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a excellent flashlight . it have good battery life and be extremely durable too . it be a perfect size for everyday use . but if you buy this flashlight you should buy the lead upgrade . it isn `` t as bright as the original bulb but it be almost as bright . this be a really durable flashlight as i say before . it have even survive be throw up into the air and even be run over by a bike ! so this flashlight be worth the money .
Flashlight	POS	4	First of all , for those wonder , this be not the latest revision of the Maglite Mini lead . as of this write the latest Maglite Mini LED be 77 lumen while the one I get from Amazon be 69 lumen . I know 8 lumen be not a huge difference but I be a sucker for have the latest version . the flashlight it be self be nice . I keep it in a black organizer so the silver stand out nicely . this be the first flashlight I have use and own that have different mode . honestly , about a month ago I do not even know flashlight have become so technologically advance so the mode be very cool . especially low power mode . you do not always need all 69 lumen so save some battery life be a plus . overall , it be a very nice flashlight especially for the $ 14 I pay for it . at it be normal advertised price there might be better option out there that be brighter and smaller . do I mention this flashlight be almost 7 '' long ? it be pretty big . on another note , do anyone know if the aftermarket crenelate bezel and window breaker for the incandescent Mini Maglite will fit on the lead version ?
Flashlight	NEG	1	buy this 2 week ago , base on my excellent experience with Maglites , BUT this one do not live up to Maglite quality . unlike the Mini mag it be fashion after , Maglite must have change something as the rotary on\/off switch die after 2 week . guess i 'll try the competition ... . .
Flashlight	POS	5	get she as advertise could not even get they at Home depot around here but Amazon have it in stock
Flashlight	POS	5	i have a mag lite and love the quality . . the firm click of the off\/on button be satisfy and a sign of suberb craftsmanship ! i do wish that maglite would make a head lamp model and\/or a tripod option to assist in hand free situation ! other wise the cost be minimal if one consider that these flash light will survive we life time ... i would bet that the designer at maglite will soon offer we a hand free model , but til then i will light my way with maglite ! thank you for reading and consider my opinion !
Flashlight	POS	5	the mini maglite be the perfect size for a purse , briefcase or tote bag . the adjustable beam allow for illuminate large or very small space . this versatile item be standard issue for all of we employee .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I have not receive it yet , they say it should be here around 6th of November . that be 6 week , come on . nothing and I say nothing have ever take this long to get here and I will never buy anything from this store again . if it do not arrive by then I want my money return at once . the light bulb I oerder come with in a week . oh yeah they come from another store . John Ekstrom
Flashlight	NEU	3	maglite use to be the standard for good flashlite . not anymore . this one have poor illuminationtion and use battery like there be no tommorrow
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be worth the price . it be well make and durable . I would definitely recommend this to a friend .
Flashlight	NEU	3	Works as advertise , the only downside be that I hate to let my kid use it as the cost of the battery make for a very expensive flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a top quality , rugged and bright flashlight with bulk . this bulk can be a asset or drawback , depend on you need . pro : a -rrb- very ruggedly make , with aluminum construction . this light can be drop in mud , rock and water without destroy it . the only drawback be that the regular bulb can break , render you light useless . however , I have never have a bulb break . if break be a concern , Maglite make a lead version , which can not break . b -rrb- this light be very bright . c -rrb- the on\/off switch be on the side , near the front . it be rubber shield to eliminate water and dirt get into the light . it be not easy to accidentally turn it on , but be easy to find in the dark by feel . d -rrb- the light take 3 d cell , easy to find and last a long time . e -rrb- police have routinely use these maglite as a combination baton and light . while , thank goodness , I have never have to use as a baton , it might add to a more secure feeling in certain situation . f -rrb- the light be a good `` thrower '' . that be , it project a tight beam a long distance without disperse much . there might be a better throwing light available , but it will undoubtedly cost much more . g -rrb- the light can be focus . it can throw a tight beam or spread the light out more to the side ; very adaptable . con : a -rrb- the light can be heavy if carry for long period on you belt or in you coat pocket , etc. . b -rrb- the light be large and bulky to carry . this could also be a advantage , so it depend on you need . conclusion : all in all this be a high quality light . it have few substitute if you be look for a bright and rugged light with some bulk . if you want a bright light in a smaller package , the Maglite xl50 might be a good option :  maglite xl50-s3016 lead flashlight , black
Flashlight	POS	5	buy this light along with they fluorescent lamp -lrb- which die after 2 month -rrb- . this light work as expect . very happy with it .
Flashlight	NEU	3	i have a ryobus flashlight that need a new bulb & the replacement bulb be the dewalt one -lrb- that be what home depot tell I -rrb- . but i be turn away when i see the bulb be $ 8\/pair ... i think what a rip off ... so i go online & i see makita have a 18v bulb -lrb- p\/n a90261 -rrb- that be similar to the dewalt . and the best part be it be $ 3.50 \/ pair & i find at a website w \/ a $ 0.01 shipping ... could not beat that . i get the bulb last night & it fit in my ryobus flashlight w \/ out a problem . whaooo whoooo !!!
Flashlight	POS	5	I love my Mini Maglite ! I have have two of they in the last 8 year -lrb- one grow leg and walk off , so I replace it for $ 10 -rrb- and never have a single problem with either . these be make by maglite and be a step up from they Solitaire AAA keylight -lrb- another great light -rrb- . the Mini run on two aa battery and have a tiny 3 volt `` bi-pin '' type bulb . the battery be store in the flashlight 's body and be access by unscrew the tail cap . the lens be make of polycarbonate , and every mating surface of the light be seal with rubber o-ring , which make it resistant to dust , moisture , and waterm and I can validate this . I have use it in the rain , mud , snow , and fog with no problem whatsoever ! I think it be interesting that the Mini do not have a traditional on\/off switch . you turn it on by twist the head assembly to the right or leave , and you focus the beam the same way from spot to flood . one of the thing about the Mini mag that I really like be that you can use it as a candle . if you turn it on and keep unscrew the the head , it will eventually come apart . the bulb will stay on so you can use the light as a candle by stand it up on the tail cap . I have find this to be invaluable when I need a desk light or reading light but do not want to get out of bed to turn mine on . the Mini mag be quality instrument . the body , end cap , and head be make out of high quality aluminum that be be computer machine from a solid billet of aluminum , which make it very strong with tight tolerance for precise fit between part . the bezel that secure the lens assembly and reflector be also make out of aluminum that have be laser etch with the Maglite logo , and the head have raise grove cut in it for a better grip when twist the head to turn the light on , off , and for focus the beam . it be also fully anodize inside and out for maximum corrosion resistance in saltwater environment . the body be also cut with a pattern in it for a better grip when you hand be wet or slippery . despite the grip , I do have it slip out of my hand several time . it feel solidly build , hefty in the hand , and I reckon will be unlikely ever to break , even if you abuse it . I be weary of the head fitting snugly to the body because there be a little play in it , but it seem to be seal off good and be not let water or dust in . Mine have be drop more time than I can remember , leave on all night and day , step on , sit on , kick , toss , dunk in water , coat in mud , bury in sand , with no problem . you could run this over and it would be fine ! the lens do get scratch up and the anodization be wear very thin , but it be still good to go . the light output be impressive for such a tiny bulb . I be surprise at how bright it be . it would throw a decent amount of light at least 50 foot and illuminate a small room with the candle function . I can not say how many time I have reach for it and turn it on and it always work . in over 7 year I only have to replace the bulb once -lrb- it come with a spare bulb in the tail cap that be secure in a plastic holder -rrb- . the battery life be pretty good . mag advertise 30 hour of run-time and I can validate that . with fresh battery I use it for over two month of occasional use before it start dim . the best part about these be that you can get a lead conversion for they . Maglite make a lead version of this , but the aftermarket conversion work much better . I install the TerraLux lead kit , and it be worth every penny . it cost more than the Maglite itself , and be more expensive than the mag lead , but it be well worth it . you get triple , maybe quadruple the light output and longer battery life to boot . it be a fantastic investment , and for those who want a physical on\/off switch -lrb- I do -rrb- , terralux make one of those as well . pro : high quality make from aluminum not plastic nearly indestructable water resistant Compact Good light output adjustible beam good battery life easily upgradable con : none ! a great light that will always be there when you need it , plus it be a Maglite so it be a company you can trust will stand behind its product . if you want a inexpensive flashlight that will last you a very long time , look at the Mini Maglite first .
Flashlight	POS	4	there be better light out there . of course they cost more money . I have 5 or 6 of these float around between car , night stand , wife night stand etc. . they work great , last a long time , and if something happen to they -lrb- battery leak , run over with tank etc -rrb- you just chuck it and buy a new one .  that say , when you be look for a flashlight that you have to rely on and you do not want to carry 3 or 4 with you , I would look to a lead flashlight . led do not burn out very fast , runtime on battery be WAY longer . my personal favorite be the Inova x5 . 5 led , 20 hour runtime on one set of battery , waterproof , and brighter than a mini mag by far . it just cost 3-4 time as much , which be why I have one of they instead of 4 .
Flashlight	POS	5	I strap my mag on the rollbar of my Wrangler , hide behind the strap for the shoulder seat belt . no one notice so it be safe and it do not use up precious storage for a wrangler . I have use mag for year and know I can count on they when I need they . Great , dependable , tough product provide the security a flashlight should give .
Flashlight	NEU	3	my mag instrument s4d016 black heavy duty 4 D-Cell Flashlight get a lot of use . this be the one -lrb- and the 6d-cell -rrb- light that lot of law enforcement carry . it be effective as a flashlight and as a tool if the use of force need to be escalate in subdue a bg -lrb- bad Guy -rrb- - order give with confidence and with commanding voice , physical force include night stick or mag light , side arm , shot gun -rrb- . there be a lot go on within the technology of flashlight recently . LED , Lithium battery , focus bezel , etc. . the mag have fall from grace a bit technologically , but be still a great flashlight for police \/ emt INCLUDING look for criminal , terrorist or signalling for a chopper pick up . the Mag Instrument S4D016 Black Heavy Duty 4 D-Cell Flashlightt be very durable and they be prove reliable . but even the police and emt and military be switch over to more tecnologically advanced product and technique to go along with the new equipment . . they have to . they life and the life of other depend on the best equipment available . and for a long time that be Mag Light . do not get I wrong . I have depend on mag lite of all size for year . but head to head , thesurefire brand have quickly surpass mag lite in every importantant aspect of flashlight - usable light power , size and weight . the Mag Instrument S4D016 Black Heavy Duty 4 D-Cell Flashlight be a good value and I have several in the house and the vehicle . but they be be replace by surefire as they wear out . John Row
Flashlight	POS	5	I have couple of 2-aa , 3-d cell and a 5-d cell maglite for 20 year . they never fail . the only time it fail be when the battery melt and glue everything shut inside . it be impossible to clean it out . I also have a bunch of led flashlight from the old 1 watt to the newer 3 watt lead . the led be much brighter but blue\/white\/cold in color . so , the LED be not dense enough . it will not reach far . the led go about 20-25 foot max and everything be fuzzy . the maglite on the other hand , be warm\/orange in color . it be like a fog light that can go up to 50 foot . it be not as bright as the led but it be much much clear and sharper to see what be at the far end . I use the led mostly for go behind the desk\/under the table kinda work . but for real work like go under the crawl space or go up in the attic , I have get to use the Maglite . the lead just will not cut it . I replace the bulb with the newer xenon light bulb . this light bulb make the Maglite much better . it be brighter and whiter but at the same time be still warm\/orange in color . so , it be still dense enough to see far and sharp . beside use the Maglite as a flashlight , you can also use it to crack and smash anything you want and it will not compliant . 5 star !
Flashlight	POS	4	use inside a jeep tj to hold maglight . Works as advertise , have hold up well . have to fill in review with more word
Flashlight	POS	5	MAGLITE flashlight win I over about four year ago . Maglites work in rain and snow , be very bright and last a exceptionally long time . I originally get my maglite 6-d flashlight as a back up to my surefire 6p lead , however , the Maglite soon win I over . now I use th surefire as a backup to my maglite ! great flashlight , would recommend .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be my first maglite and I be very happy with it . even after know the length of this flashlight , I be still surprise by how long it be when I receive it . build quality be top notch , just as I be expect from a brand like Maglite . if you be after a more practical-size flashlight this be definitely not the one for you . however , highly recommend if you want the biggest and baddest flashlight around .
Flashlight	POS	5	this light be pretty siick ... i buy it bcuz i be go to camp in like 2 week ... and i hear that mag-light be a good brand so i decide to get this ... it look nice and the light be a nice white beam
Flashlight	POS	5	while I have run into a flashlight that be slightly more waterproof than this one it be almost three time more expensive . in my humble opinion value be a major component of any design . for this reason , this flashlight rate a 5 . grasp this in you hand and you be immediately strike by its design in strength and careful manufacturing . the adjustable beam , which spread or focus the light expand the usefulness . narrow for read a map late at night or wide angle for walk down the lane . a spare bulb -lrb- a old concept that seem to have get lose until now -rrb- increase the likelihood that you will have light when you want it . mag take a simple product , add important feature and then use quality material and method to produce it at a very attractive price .
Flashlight	POS	5	this the second replacement battery pack I have purchase . what set this one apart be the price . most place want $ 40 , or more , for this battery pack . I still feel that a $ 10 to $ 15 price range would be fair . but , pay half price do make I feel better . beware beware beware I do not use the flashlight everyday , so when I try it for the second time , just past the thirty day return period , I find that it be defective . guess what nobody would warranty it !
Flashlight	POS	5	I never know how much my old battery be lack until I receive this new battery and give my flashlight a new lease on life . Amazon also have a excellent price .
Flashlight	POS	4	be use this light for nearly 5 year for all kind of work in attic or under house . I have always be able to rely on this thing for difficult to spot wire or for work in a dark closet when mount panel for security system . the rotate head be also very handy for that perfect angle when work in odd location . I do wish it have a clip or hook that would attach to 2x4 's in the attic . that be the only reason why i only give it 4 star .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a great flashlight ! the price from Amazon be half of what snap on tool charge . if you be older or have trouble see in dark place , this be the flashlight for you . one word of caution -- do not drop when hot !! you will be replace the bulb .
Flashlight	POS	5	great product , only problem be there be no spot to attach any type of string to the bottom like I have see on other model . keep this in mind when purchase the accesory kit .
Flashlight	POS	5	this a great light , especially if you already have some other Dewalt tool that use the same battery . the head pivot to give different lighting angle and with the battery it stand up on it be own with no problem . no more buy disposable battery for flashlight .
