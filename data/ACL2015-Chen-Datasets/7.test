GPS	POS	5	simple , inexpensive but well make thin case . will perfectly fit , protect and help you carry around you 5 inch Garmin Nuvi . deliver quickly . highly recommend .
GPS	POS	5	I use the Garmin 76CSX for both professional and personal purpose and think it be excellent . I have use the older version -lrb- Garmin Map76 -rrb- for year -lrb- 2004-2009 -rrb- and recently update to this newer version . Antennae reception be incredible ; I keep it in my pocket all day and the device rarely miss a point while record my daily track -lrb- hike range from 15-25 km\/day -rrb- . the MapSource software be also fairly good , and you can download you track and waypoint to google earth without any trouble . I do not geocache so I can not provide any input in that regard , but I imagine it would be well suit for it .
GPS	POS	5	what a world of difference have a gp device to guide we to unfamiliar destination on we recent trip . Tomtom be so accurate , we soon do not bother take the detailed road map and print direction along . we day of road trip with paper map be over ! Tomtom one be definitely worth the money . do not bother buy a $ 2000 + gp system integrate into you next car . Tomtom one will get you there for approximately $ 200 . a big bonus : you can use it in any of you car . Tomtom one be compact and fit easily in my pocket . a great buy !!!
GPS	POS	5	this be a very durable mount and the bag be weighty . I would recommend for a flatter dash in car . the hold device be quiet strong and durable with a nice strong grip . ca not go wrong .
GPS	NEU	3	Garmin have several feature that relate to the time of day . some example be sun & moon time , estimate time of arrival . if you have travel into a different time zone out of you original setting , the GPS unit leave it up to you to calculate the correct time base on you original setting . this be very inconvenient when you have travel from the west coast to the east coast thru four time zone . it also provide a problem when you destination be right on a time zone border . a cell phone automaticly change for time zone , but NOT a GPS unit that can calculate exactly where you be in the world ???? this be a Garmin overlook that I believe they should correct .
GPS	POS	5	we order this model instead of update and older one because we want the lane assist feature , it really pay off when we go to Florida in September .
GPS	NEG	2	I have own this unit for a couple of year , and I have upgrade the software recently as well -lrb- rev 5.4 -rrb- . I would not buy another gp of this model , and I have doubt about Magellan product in general after my experience with this unit . my reason be a little different than other reviewer . on my unit , the electronic compass be unreliable , and have to be recalibrate every week . this be particularly so if it be use around the electromagnetic environment of a vehicle , and whenever battery be change . most importantly , there be no warning that the compass need to be reset . therefore you might find yourself walk along a head that be completely inaccurate , without realize it . one of the key issue when use a unit like this be trust , and in particular trust when in the ` nearly lose , semi panic ' situation that we all hope to never find ourselves in . my unit fall short often enough that I can not trust some of the datum I be get . in a effort to improve reliability I have set the compass orientation to `` GPS course '' , so that when the compass fail , then at least the direction of movement on the map will be reliable . however I find it disconcert when ` head ' be so dramatically incorrect . evidently ` head ' be datum derive from the internal compass , and the unit be happy to give datum that be inconsistent with it be own datum from the GPS direction . for example , when walk quickly east , the unit will always accurately show my movement on the map as east , even when the electronic compass have lose calibration . however on the next screen the ` head ' will be label as a ridiculous 221 degree , or some other bizarre number , even when the unit be pointed directly along the eastward line of movement . it seem to I that it should be easy for the unit to be program to show a warn to the user that the compass be give inaccurate datum , since the datum from the unit be in conflict with itself . if such a warning be reliable , then I would at least know when the unit need recalibration . sadly , Magellan seem to have make no effort to accomplish this . without a internal check of the electronic compass I would not trust this unit to get I out of trouble . in some way I should have anticipate this . clearly , a gp should not be rely on for simple information as to which way north be . it be much better for pinpoint you exact location , ultimately the most important datum that a gp offer . therefore if I ever need to buy another gp I would get one that do not have a internal compass . it would be nice if Magellan be to offer a software upgrade that allow the user to turn off the internal compass , so that battery use would be lower and datum would be more reliable . spurious datum be worse than no datum at all .
GPS	POS	5	I love this gp ! ca not go wrong with garmin !! even let 's you know what lane you need to be in when drive in major traffic !!!
GPS	POS	5	I own a old 3.5-inch Garmin StreetPilot c340 for a few year . it be a good small machine , and still work , but it be screen be small , and the body be very thick . it be time to buy another thin and big screen Garmin , so I get a 5 '' Nuvi 1490-MLT . it have a huge screen , and thin body just what I have be look for . I have this gp for a few month already , but do not really test it yet . it be work just fine like my old pilot so far . the 1490 t model price have drop significantly , but 1490-LMT model be still expense .
GPS	POS	5	I love this Garmin product ! I own several Garmin product , and I have never have any issue with they ! my wife and I be avid biker , and use this every time we ride or go run !
GPS	POS	5	the only letdown from this otherwise fine gp be that you can not map out a route with multiple stop along the way and save it . that make trip planning with multiple stop a little mre challenge .
GPS	POS	5	what be great about it : Easy to Use & Understand ... Lifetime Maps ... Lane Assist be a Life Saver ... customizable ... Nice Interface I travel a lot , but where map and direction be concern , I be a dummy . I have always have problem in figure out where I be go , how to get there and how to get back . this be my first GPS unit and the process in select a good one seem confusing and difficult . call it good fortune , but after web research , I land on this one , and WOW , be I glad I do ! EVERY thing I have do & discover from the minute I get home and open the box have reinforce this great purchase . a few highlight . 1 . lifetime map ... rather than to pay $ 90 - 100 per year for map update , pay a little more upfront , get a unit that have the `` LM '' designation . with what little knowledge I have about GPS unit , this be my first great decision . 2 . Lane Assist and detailed `` junction View '' . keep you in the right lane , and a great split-screen view of highway junction as you approach they . as I say , I be a traffic dummy and these be the place where I always get lose , go or confuse ... but I have try this and it work . I just listen to what be be say , check the lane indicator and stay there until tell otherwise . I have the benefit of be able to test this in Los Angeles , San Jose & Portland - and I sail through each of these city with ease . 3 . customization ... when you go to the Garmin site , register and log in , you can then download different type of vehicle , voice and other nicety for you device . you can even create custom voice , such as you own ! map update ... the process take a few hour the first time . you do have to download they `` Communicator Plugin '' and the Map Updater first , after that , every thing go smoothly and -lrb- again -rrb- good for dummy such as myself . fit and finish ... during my search for a gp device , I look at all the major maker and find I find the look of the Garmin road and map a lot better than any of the other . I also like the stark design of the unit itself . it just look GOOD . this be a 5 '' unit and -lrb- for I -rrb- very easy to see & read . should you pay a little more and get a unit that also include Traffic capability ? for some , perhaps . I find this on sale for $ 127.00 and for that price , this be PERFECT .
GPS	POS	5	I be impressed and relieved know there be a 2yr warranty on this Garmin GPS watch I purchase . at least if something go wrong it can be take care of and I receive the papers in the mail shortly after purchase the Garmin watch .
GPS	POS	5	I own 3 gp , one garmin , one tomtom 910 and since yesterday a 510 . I use the garmin on the trail and the jeep , and my 910 have be with I for a couple of month cruise Europe and North America . I buy the 510 , because it be cheap and also base on my experience with the 910 . my wife want a gp in she car so I order it , in 5 min at work ... then , a couple of day later , while wait for the item , I start read the review and be stun by some of the negative comment ; 2 possibility , either I buy a lemon , or some people have no idea of what they be buy or how to operate a basic electronic device -lrb- like have the 12.00 flash on they VCR -rrb- ... after own the 510 for 10 day , I now believe that some people should stick to paper map ! pro : setup : 20 min , include download the update , and set up the bracket on the windshield of my wife car . navigate the menu be a breeze . reliability : perfect . not one reboot ... the 510 will even navigate through some forest trail in the mountain . pous : plentiful enough ... Bluetooth : synch it with my blackberry pearl the FIRST TIME !!! con : none so far ...
GPS	NEU	3	I buy this unit over TX Giving sale . the primary reason be that my other Garmin c330 gp be get dated and for the price of new map I could get this -lrb- with lifetime update -rrb- . set up be fairly easy . user interface do not take long get use to . during the trip it have nice trip summary such as mile left , time leave , upcome exit with exit # in top right corner . I have only make one long trip with this gp and even though I have fastest route set on , the GPS pick some really small road towards the end of the destination . I be follow a route that I have already travel on so I choose to ignore the GPS . it re-calculate fairly quickly . overall it be a good buy for the money
GPS	POS	5	if you be interested in the GPS aspect of the device , you can read the other review -- like they nearly all say , the 205 and 305 be excellent . I want to specifically point out how much improve and how accurate the heart rate monitor and strap be over the previous version -lrb- forerunner 301 -rrb- , as well as how favorably the 305 hrm function in comparison to the benchmark Polar monitor . the 305 have not drop my heart rate once in nearly three week of daily workout range from one to two hour . I have and have use the 301 for the better part of a year , and continually have problem with interference , which cause extend datum dropout and extremely high , inaccurate reading . the 305 be nothing like the old 301 , which be reason enough to purchase if you require a solid hrm with you gp datum . a side benefit -- it be accurate ! I have compare it with my Polar Accurex monitor , and it be dead on . if anything , the Polar update a bit slower than the Garmin . all in all , a huge improvement , and a great product . highly recommend . also , as a number of other reviewer have say , get the SportTracks software . it be free and it will greatly enhance the viewing of the datum from you new ForeRunner 305 .
GPS	POS	5	I have try several other mount platform -lrb- suction cup , vent mount , spiderpodium -rrb- and hand down , this unit be better than all of they . it be extremely stable and the phone can be use in both portrait or landscape mode . great product .
GPS	POS	5	the TomTom GPS work great . the only problem I have notice be that the map software be out of date . buy the map upgrade do not do any better in direction . I would still buy this item over other gp manufactor .
GPS	POS	4	we buy two of the GPSMAP 76Csx model for we resource staff . after work with the device for a few week , I decide to purchase my own to replace my aging GARMIN eTrex Vista The 76Csx be go to be a great tool for we wetland delineation process . although of low reolution and scale the ability to load the MapSource 1:100000 map will provide a little more detail than the base map . we use DNR Garmin to transfer these point between the device and we arcmap \/ arcgi software . this easily allow we to display we field map coordinate in a geo-referrenced satelite image environment for plan purpose . be able to change datum on the fly be important for we vary datum format . I only wish the unit would accept more text annotation and display it in the mapping software . this would be more useful for discusion of individual point datum .
GPS	POS	4	my plan be to only use this gp unit when I be chart out new course , but I be find myself always strap it on now ! it be less cumbersome than I expect and work very well . out of about 20 run , it lose contact with the satellite once for about one mile - otherwise it have be faultless . it take about 3-4 minute to initiate contact when turn on and you need to leave it someplace still while it be find the satellite .
GPS	POS	5	have upgrade from we old Garmin nuvus this Model be awesome !!! I buy this for my boyfriend for Valentine 's day and now I want one LOL . the large screen be great , the voice command need some work however give simple command it do just fine . overall I be very happy with this Garmin .
GPS	POS	5	after be show how to use this watch by a friend who have the same one , it be so easy to use . I like simple electronics for timing and distance so this be perfect for I . after a little while , I do not notice how large this watch be . do lot of research and this be the best run watch for the feature and price accord to hundred of review - even compare to newer model . great value .
GPS	POS	5	I decide to purchase this watch to help I train for a half Marathon . what a great training aid ! this watch can do just about anything you can imagine . naturally , it record you precise pace and distance , which be helpful , but it also allow you to set up a advanced workout . for example , if you be suppose to run 3 mile , then run 4 2 minute aerobic interval and then run another 3 mile , you can program this on you watch so that while you be run , the watch will notify you when you need to speed up or slow down . the watch also come with a heart rate monitor . after each run , I like to review how I do on each section of the training -lrb- i.e. pace , heart rate , etc. -rrb- the program be easier to set up on you computer than on the watch , but once the software be install , it be very user friendly and just take a couple of seconds to sync to the watch . I never run without the watch anymore ! the watch also have mode that be specific to other activity such as biking , but so far I have only use it for run . I would highly recommend this watch for anyone who be serious about training for a race , or even someone who just want to have a easier way to monitor and improve his\/her workout .
GPS	NEG	2	we use this on trip to Italy and Iceland and find it be unreliable enough that we use paper map and avoid this when we could . we have a earlier Nuvi -lrb- 255 -rrb- that we like , so it be not the overall brand . there be two type of problem : - it reset itself without we do anything . my guess be that when there be momentary blip in voltage , it sens the charger be unplugged and replugged , it reset itself and usually take a couple of minute to go through the Garmin screen to be useful again . the cigarette lighter charger connection be flaky enough that a device need to be tolerant of such change . -lrb- this happen in 2 rental car , so it be not a bad cigarette lighter . -rrb- the same thing happen when the usb connection in the back of the GPS be bump . on a highway the reset might not be a big deal - but when you actually need it in navigate italian city , have it stop work be a major problem . worse be when sometimes it would show a startup screen -lrb- show a icon of it connect to a computer -rrb- and it would not restart itself - usually hold the power button down would get it to stop so we could restart it , but several time it just hang . - in italian town and city , it would tell we to turn the wrong way on 1-way street -lrb- happen twice in Cremona -rrb- . more subtly -lrb- this I can understand , but it be a notable concern -rrb- , it could not differentiate between medieval street and major boulevard : it would have direction zigzag through the narrow street that be charming when you be on foot , but really should not be navigate by anything larger that a Fiat 500 or Smart car - and subsequently we would find that we would start a block from a main road that a human would have direct we to . again , a paper map be preferable .
GPS	POS	5	I have have some reservation after read the worst review -lrb- that it be too big on the wrist , the speed be erratic , it take too long to get the map etc. -rrb- . it be true that it be quite bigger than a watch -lrb- but then who expect a small size ? -rrb- , but the size be not prohibitive . the forerunner pick up map quite quickly -lrb- although I must say that I do try it in a small town with not many tree or big building -rrb- . finally , the speed be always accurate . overall , I find this watch a great exercise tool outdoors . I can not vouch for its software as I do not use this function . one thing be that it be clear the price go down . I pay $ 150 and now it be $ 128 . as with all electronics , the more you wait the less you pay .
GPS	POS	5	I update from a 4.3 inch screen . really nice unit , I use it to travel the Midwest in my work ! the price be right & shipping be fast . I be very satisfied !
GPS	POS	5	I delay buy the 305 because I really want a gp watch that could report cadence . I consider the Polar rs800g3 , but it be more than twice the price and not as easy to use . I consider wait for the Forerunner 405 , but I be start a new season and do not want to change run log mid-season . so , I buy the 305 for less than $ 220 and add the foot pod -lrb- $ 80 -rrb- a week later . I plan on use the foot pod for indoor workout . my first run with it be on the treadmill . although the distance report differ slightly , it be fairly close without calibration . when I download the datum to my computer , I be surprise that it have record cadence ! but I pessimistically assume that it would not work when the gp be in use . my next run be outdoors , and to my surprise the 305 record cadence and gp distance at the same time ! I be even able to change the display to show cadence during my run . that be how easy it be to configure ! this watch greatly exceed my expectation ! I strongly recommend it for any serious endurance athlete !
GPS	POS	5	I purchase one of these almost a year ago , product have be excellent . I have use the mount on my dirt bike in very rough terrain go very fast , no problem . I have have this mount on my mountain bike in Moab , UT no problem . I ride my dirt bike one to three time a week over rough trail with this mount and no problem . when I go to a wma on my mountain bike and ride for a whole weekend I never have a problem . I think the people where the GPS fall out after two small bump and such do not install the mount correctly . I never write review unless a product real impress I and this one do . I have purchase two so I do not have to keep switching hardware between my dirt bike and mountain bike . this be a great product .
GPS	NEU	3	I purchase this gp approximately two year ago and have have to replace the 12v electrical cord and the back plane mount device already . I use the device while on vacation . total time use while on maybe three dozen time . the external electrical connection be not very rugged . I have to hard wire the antenna as the fold down unit do not reliably maintain satellite connection . think twice before purchase ... only at a severe discount .
GPS	POS	4	so far we have be very pleased with the Magellan RoadMate 760 . we have try it out on a roadtrip and locally and seem to be right on the money . like the feature that tell you the length of time to complete the trip at the speed you be go .
GPS	NEU	3	the map be at least 2 year out of date . it be not 100 % correct but be more useful than not .
GPS	POS	5	as a native New Yorker , I have become a direction snob . I know my way around the subway system , as well as the highway and bi-way of the City . but then , I move to Atlanta , where there be over 100 street name peachtree-something . I carry road map in various place in my car . I purchase the Garmin nuvus 3790LMT GPS Navigator for its ability to navigate road and re-configure route on the fly . and while it be true that several top-of-the-line gp unit can do this , no other unit do the task as well , with as little heft , as do the 3790LMT . this unit be thin and lightweight - two stats that matter when the pull of gravity to a await floor can destroy heftier GPS unit . the feature-packed 3790lmt afford I a lifetime of traffic and map update , as well as Bluetooth connectivity . the unit pair flawlessly with my iPhone , and its voice command `` understand '' I better than my first wife . the setup be easy and intuitive . within minute I be ready to connect the 3790lmt to my MacBook pro and download the most up-to-date map of North America available . the 3790lmt work whatever mode of land transportation you prefer - automobile , bicycle or pedestrian . and it allow you to maximize fuel economy , and save you precious time as well . there be super expensive gp unit for the nerd-acious and for the gadget friendly who love the challenge of difficult programming . the Garmin nuvus 3790lmt be the GPS unit for the rest of we .
GPS	POS	5	first time I use my forerunner 305 -lrb- hour outta the box -rrb- , I achieve a pr run a 4 miler by 3:30 !!! great training partner . ca not wait til the Philadelphia Marathon !!!
GPS	POS	5	the Mio c220 be everthe that be write about it . the Mio arrive ready to use straight from the box . there be certain combination of option that you have to tweak for you personal use , once accomplish you will truly have a remarkable and affordable gp unit . I read many comment prior to buy the c220 . the few con that I read about the product , -lrb- I be convinced -rrb- , be due to incorrect setting . once you have the correct combination of type of road you will use , or the route you prefer , -lrb- fast , economical , or most direct route etc. -rrb- , I have find it perform without question as the best unit at the best price . I would definately recommend this unit to everyone .
GPS	POS	5	I get this as a gift for my girlfriend who be old GPS die . this one update on the computer and after that it be ready to go . it give live traffic and good suggestion as to different route to take if the traffic get too heavy . I like the feature of how long to reach you destination , and the map cover all area that some of my other gp device do not .
GPS	POS	5	try this unit after I find out the `` new '' Garmin eTrex Legend H only output proprietary Garmin datum -lrb- original eTrex Legend will output nmea datum -rrb- . this make it useless for software other than Garmin 's own overpriced version . after speak with the rather rude rep at Garmin , I decide to look elsewhere . I already have and be happy with Streets & Trips and share trip file with friend and family member . I try another data-conversion software to allow use of the Legend h , but it be simply a hassle . this one hook up seamlessly and acquire satellite much more quickly than the Legend do . since I only need a unit to feed the notebook with s&t; s , this be ideal . it be quite small and have a small suction cup with a cable slot to hold it steady on the dash , if you do not care to use the magnetic back . it use only a tiny amount of power through the usb port ... in fact , I have run it on a old notebook with a PCMCIA usb adapter and Windows 2000 and it work perfectly . the usb cable be longer than the Garmin unit , also . I order a replacement for the original eTrex Legend to use on hike and to save track when not in the truck -lrb- still have all the add-on and adapter for it -rrb- . the original unit last 5 year and the replacement be still that same unit , so it 'll work through a serial adapter to usb in a pinch . too bad Garmin seem to have become so greedy as to force use of its software . the vendor ship it quickly and it arrive in perfect condition .
GPS	POS	5	I check all the review on as many site as I could find and all of they recommend this gp . I would not use the compass so I do not buy the 60cxs unit and this one come with a compass but you have to be move to make it work . it arrive when they say it would and Amazon have the lowest price . if you add the mapping software , it give you direction the same as a car unit but do not talk to you . I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who into geocashing , biking , walk or any similar activity .
GPS	NEU	3	I have just purchase this item and be disappoint at the way Amazon be market this . they retail price say the unit be list for over $ 700 and the Garmin site have it for a little over $ 300 . they also list a very limited number leave for sale -lrb- 1 item leave -rrb- that do not drop when I buy mine ... it be still a good deal on a great unit , but I think Amazon be better than this !!!
GPS	POS	5	this thing be great !! I have be use NeverLost -lrb- Magellan -rrb- in rental car for a few year and want my own . the Magellan have better selection for route , i.e. fastest , Shortest , most use of freeway , but the Nuvi be great . small , great battery life , good direction . I use it to find the Hess Collection Winery in Napa and trust I , that place be nowhere !! would have give up be it not for `` Jill '' tell we to keep on go . great device .
GPS	POS	5	it do everything I expect it to do and they some . I have use it for over a month now and it have not freeze up once . the other brand `` nextar x3-02 '' I try freeze up several time each trip . the cost at Amazon be the best I find . one to two hundred dollar less the all the big retail store . I would recommend that you download the manual from the Garmin web site and read it . every review I read that say it would not do something I be able to find out how to do it by read the download manual . I do have to call the support desk to find out how to set a location as my start point other then the one I be located at , so that I could map a route form that other location . I be able to get a person after a 20 minute wait . better then the average support telephone # form today 's service department . and the person I speak with be helpful and knowledgeable . he explain how to view the map with the GPS off , go to a location and then pick set location . the manual tell how to set a location but do not explain that be what need to be do to route a map form some location other then you current location . the manual be a must if you want to get the most usage out of you unit . I would recommend this unit to anyone that want a dependable unit .
GPS	NEU	3	I be happy overall with the product . pro : Easy to use . con : Garmin advertise City Xplorer software for certain city on they website . this software show all available transit type for that city and the route . they do say not all city have this information . from Amazon.com `` include advanced navigation feature to take the worry out of travel , include cityxplorer pedestrian map '' . I order City Xplorer for Houston from the Garmin website . there be no disclaimer list for that city . I could not find any bus route . I call they help line which be very polite and willing to help I . it end up that the person help I have to call 3 different place within the company to get a answer for I . there be only 3 city that include bus information . they be all in Europe . they refund my money without my have to ask for it . it do show the closest bus stop to you location but if you do not know you way around the city this be not helpful . it do show the Metrorail . this feature be why I choose this particular brand and model .
GPS	POS	5	I buy this gp for we trip to south and the experience be wonderful . ease of enter address , select we favorite place , real time map and voice prompt help a lot ! we never get lose . Wish total trip summary be display before start of drive . a solar charger will also be a great help when wire charger get lose !
GPS	NEG	2	the description say '' ... you TomTom EASE guide you door-to-door with turn-by-turn speak instruction INCLUDING STREET NAMES . '' it do NOT speak street name . this be word so carefully so as to cover they ass but it be deceptive .
GPS	POS	5	I decide to purchase this Garmin for my upcoming trip to Rome and Venice . I be attract to it because of its european map , as well as its pedestrian -lrb- walking -rrb- mode . I be a little hesitant at first as some give it mixed review , but I decide to take the plunge . well , I just return from Europe have use the Garmin nuvus 1370t extensively in my travels and all I can say be WOW !!!! before my trip , I download the City map on the Garmin site for both Rome and Venice . this give you very detailed information for the individual area you be go to and I would recommend do the same if you be go to be walk around . remember , this unit do come with Europe install so this add on be just more detailed information . walk around Rome and Venice be a joy with the 1370t . my family and I walk everywhere and never get into a taxi . people be ask we direction after awhile ! I find that we would venture out in any direction we want because we know we could always make we way back . it help you plan you trip give you the most interesting site to see in and around where you be . in Venice , everyone be glue to the map in they hand . they have to stop at every intersection because it be so easy to get lose in that city . even look at the map in they hand , they be still lose ! the Garmin allow I to explore with ease and not have to stop at every turn to reacquaint myself to where I be . now be this thing perfect ? here be the deal . in Rome and Venice , you be surround by tall building that cause problem for the gp reception . that be not Garmin 's fault , it be just the reality of use a gp receiver . in both city , you lack of reception last only a small amount of time and then you will enter a better reception area and you unit will update itself pretty quickly . lose reception , while walk , be really not a big deal . you already have you way map out on the screen , so you follow it even though it may not be update you precise position . this be a absolute must buy for those travel . I have also use the automobile mode and it be outstanding ! here be a few wish list for future update . in walk mode , you do not know which way to begin walk . you have to walk a small amount in a direction , look at the screen and see what direction you go , then adjust to the way you be suppose to be go . this be a bit frustrating . next , when you in a unfamiliar city , it would be nice if the unit could give you some restaurant recommendation base on user review , price etc. . right now , it give you a list of all the restaurant , but in a unfamiliar city with a family , it would be nice to narrow that list down . in walk mode , I want to know how much longer I need to walk -lrb- in mile or part of mile -rrb- to reach my destination . it give you this information in automobile mode but not in pedestrian mode . bottom line : this unit will help you explore with confidence and reduce you stress while travel so you can spend more time enjoy you vacation !
GPS	NEG	2	purchase in March ' 12 . bad connection w \/ charge mechanism within gp to start with . map update become available and everything become a big mess ! file go miss , have to contact Garmin via several email & countless phone call . just one big headache . also buy a car charger that the cord split within 2 mo . and be return a `` refurbish '' one . spend a little more $ $ $ and hopefully get a better product .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin 305 have be a excellent enhancement to my workout . I use it for run and biking and i can not wait to take it on my next ski trip this winter .
GPS	POS	5	how can people slam the Legend when it can be pick up for less than $ more than the basic etrex ? I use the basic model for over a year , love it , then buy the Legend . I be delighted with all the extra option . the high re screen , much better than the original etrex . I love that I can upload my waypoint and track from my old e-trex and download back to the new one . the pan map be a nice addition as be the calculator and calender . I think some people want it to perform like a $ 1000 unit but only pay $ 150 - do not listen to they . my only complaint be that the click-stick be not on the right side .
GPS	POS	4	I know many of we be go crazy try to figure out which of the latest trucker gp unit be the best value . I have it down to two for many reason . I will go into why in another review when I make my final decision . no one have write anything -lrb- that be no user -rrb- about the Rand McNally tnd-710 . but I will because I just order it . I have be use this one -lrb- the Garmin dezl-560 lmt -rrb- lmt just mean include free lifetime map and traffic update . the lt will cost you to update the numap -lrb- that the mapping co -rrb- after 60 day from purchase . its worth get the LMT model for the lifetime update of map . do not get that confuse with software update to fix glitch ... they be always free . now about the lifetime traffic . well the receiver it come with that be build into the power cable be free because it throw up advertisement at you now and then . I hate advertisement ! I call Garmin which have excellent support as do rm and they say the non-ad power -lrb- the traffic receiver be build into the power cable -rrb- cable will cost a extra $ 120.00 and if you want premium traffic and construction service add $ 49.00 to that . WOW the only thing I can say good about that be its a one time fee . now to add traffic and speed camera update that $ 25.00 per year . let add this up . I pay $ 459.00 for the unit -lrb- 560lmt -rrb- on Amazon . $ 70.00 for accessory -lrb- Micro sd , Case , Windshield mount , Dash mount -rrb- $ 170.00 for traffic receiver power cord with prem software and $ 25.00 for the first year of camera warning . that $ 724.00 all together if you want all the bell and whistle as I always do . by the way all that ado about get add-free traffic ... it suck anyway . the traffic predictably be poor at best . just turn it off so you do not see the advertisement . save the $ 170.00 . maybe it will get better . its a 3rd part co so its hard to say . rm -lrb- Rand McNally -rrb- say it will offer a similar traffic receiver and service in June when there external antenna , case and other accessory come out . right now rm only offer map update for one year so its hard to say what the end cost of this unit will be . I want the best ! ... so I be spend alot to find out . DieselBoss be the only retailer I could find that be take the time to compare these two unit . check it out . http:\/\/www.dieselboss.com\/truck_gps_review_features.htm . the info be still come in about the garmin but I agree with what they say about the Garmin so far . . I buy the Garmin here on Amazon ... best price . I have own or use 5 other gpss to date . Garmin dezl 560lmt -lrb- same as lt but no lifetime traffic -rrb- pro ... \* start , route and re-route fast 10-30sec , no lockup yet \* -lrb- great route so far ... this be the most important feature about any TRUCK GPS . -rrb- \* show the post truck speed of most road next to you speed that turn red when you go over . \* -lrb- Garmin have a unbelievable database -rrb- every address I enter it have . this be not true of Google or even my co-pilot -lrb- pc-miler -rrb- . \* loud Speaker . \* quick access to brightness control . Easy snap-in mount -lrb- no usb plug to plug in every time which can break -rrb- \* Lane asst ... yea ... love that . \* lot of fun stuff and voice you can add from the garmin and 3rd party website . con ... \* 5 '' I want 7 '' . \* do not show the name of cross street as you pass they . \* you can not just pan & zoom on the nav map . you have to go to a special map screen . \* ETA do not adjust or work well at all ... but its so bad i be sure they will fix the software soon . my co-pilot ETA work perfectly . \* you can not show ETA and MTD -lrb- mile to destination -rrb- at the same time . Booo ... I want both ! . \* the graphic could be better . co-pilot be Sweet look . sound like I be work up Co-Pilot ... lol ... I be not . poor poor Truck map almost every time with Co-Pilot ... DON `` t buy . over View ... the hardware be rock solid , no freeze here and it re-route you fast if you miss a turn but I wish they have a 7 ' . \* the Software be very good for truck mapping and address thanks to garmin extensive datum base but need improvement on the stuff that not as important but convenient . I will update this as I learn , use and remember more . go on 3 day trip tomorrow . md-in-nj-dc-md let see what Rand McNally bring to the table with the tnd710 . I can not wait to get it .
GPS	POS	5	this be actually a gift , but the recipient love it . she have a Garmin before and she say this one be much better ... now that could be because she be tell I that and I give it to she and she do not want to hurt my feeling , but I have notice that she have not use she Garmin since she get this one . you be the judge ...
GPS	POS	5	I purchase the 350 nuvus after much research , include reading review . I just take a 2400 mile trip across the US , include Yellowstone and other site out west . the nuvus be only inaccurate a couple of time and that be when I take what appear to be newly open road . it be definitely useful , but you also need to pay attention to the road sign . I especially love that nuvus give warning about upcome turn and advance warning when you need to be in the right or left lane before a turn . we have start use the nuvus for geocach and it have be right on ! it be also useful when arrive to a destination early -- I be able to look up hotel further down the road and make a new reservation ! what a timesaver . I will not travel without it again !
GPS	POS	5	I be so pleased with the rooCASE Neoprene Sleeve that I will buy more to protect other item that I have . it be very protective , very attractive and do the job nicely . it fit my gp like it be make for it .
GPS	POS	5	look no further , I want to find more information about this watch and do some more extensive research before my purchase . then I stumble onto this blog by dc rainmaker and I be sell ! this review be the most informative review I find so far . I have have the watch for almost a month now and I love it and get exactly what I expect from the review . great training device , and most importantly I think the watch make the run that much more fun . -lrb- ... -rrb-
GPS	NEG	1	I buy this Garmin because it seem like it would be easy to use . my daughter have a 350 and she love it . but I do not love mine . it only hold a charge for about 2 hour , it do not come with any external battery charge except a vehicle power outlet cord and when I plug the GPU unit in it immediately go into charge mode and will not operate . same thing when I plug it into my desktop comptuter at home -lrb- with a usb cord from my camera , since one be not supply with the Garmin . -rrb- when it be charge , I can not do anything else : no naviagaion , no download waypoint , nothing . plus , it doen ' t know where anything be ! it send I way out of my way or onto dead end street try to get anywhere ! I do not know anything about other GPS unit , but if they be all like this , who need it ?? I 'll just go back to my old way : highway map and print out from Google map -- they be more accurate anyway ...
GPS	NEG	1	never pick up satellite signal to change from default Chicago location . too bad -- seem like good combination of feature and customizable tools\/preferences .
GPS	POS	4	I use this 4.3 '' version in my car ; the 5 '' version would be just a bit too large . pro : \* the gp be easy and logical to input address into . it also quickly find every address I have put in so far and the give route be very reasonable to I , give my knowledge of the area and road . \* the touch screen be very responsive . \* the suction cup and mount bracket work very well . no adhesive need on two different car . \* both the mount bracket and the power connection be magnetic and work better than I anticipate . fast and trouble-free connect and disconnect . \* the screen seem fine and normally responsive in cold weather -lrb- -10 f -rrb- . \* you can connect the gp to you pc and the internet to get free lifetime map update . First you Download and install the `` mytomtom support application '' . then you connect you gp unit to you pc and turn on the GPS . then the TomTom software open you default browser automatically and load you TomTom account page -lrb- once you have a account -rrb- and give you a status . this be also dependent on if you have you browser cookie save for TomTom -lrb- you can use a white list if you regularly discard cookie -rrb- . when connect and update map , you browser window say `` TomTom GO -lrb- model number -rrb- '' , then `` install ... '' . quite logical and easy to use . \* on certain screen you can control map with finger swipe and 2-finger zoom -lrb- similar to a iPhone -rrb- . \* the screen be very bright and can easily be see in intense daylight . there be a night mode -lrb- that it can switch to automatically -rrb- and the screen 's brightness be adjustable . \* it display the speed limit on that section of the road . it be very accurate on both where the speed limit change and what it be . this help I with the age old question : `` what be the speed limit here again ? '' \* Traffic Information feature : this can recalculate you trip time , and suggest alternate route , depend on traffic . this feature could be great , but it appear to not be available in my city . on the TomTom website you can get a list of city available . my city be not list . the car power cord have a traffic receiver build into it -lrb- when you connect the car cord it say `` rds-tmc receiver connect '' -rrb- . while I be not really sure how this feature work technically , the manual say that the gp display traffic datum with red indicate congestion and green show no problem . pro with limitation : \* the manual be extremely easy to read and get you start fast . it explain the GPS graphic well . most of the GPS menu be intuitive and with a bit of work you be good to go . however , the manual do not go into great detail of all the option and setting . for basic task this be not a big deal as they be fairly obvious . however , there be a few option that take I forever to find -lrb- see below -rrb- . \* the unit have the ability to use command speak by you . for example , `` calculate a alternative route . '' when work , it be great , but it have a few major stumbling block . first , it take I forever to figure out how to turn on the speak command option . it turn out it be bury under the `` make you own menu '' option and a check box of `` voice command and control . '' it be nowhere else . not obvious ! next , the unit do not give on-screen prompt for what command work , so you have to know this . to view a list of voice command , you go under `` help '' in the Main menu , then `` Product manual '' and then `` what can I say ? '' again , not obvious . \* this unit have Bluetooth -lrb- BT -rrb- for link a phone and use hand free . the speaker quality and dial portion work well . but this BT feature have its problem . when the GPS be turn on , it find the paired phone . it then automatically retrieve the phone 's current contact . so far so good . however , when you display the contact , the phone number be okay , but it list all the name as a bunch of number -lrb- a software bug no doubt -rrb- . where 's Joe ? or Betty ? very aggravate . you can only find they by they phone number . so the import phone book be pretty worthless because of this . some quick web search seem to indicate this be a common problem . further search have not come up with a solution for my gp model at this time . con : \* power up and down . some car have power a -rrb- go to they cigarette lighter -lrb- cl -rrb- adapter only when the key be turn on , b -rrb- other car power the cl all the time , regardless of the key position . it would be nice if this unit adapt to both kind of car . for example , for key car the unit do not power up when power be apply via the car 's cl adapter . this feature would be handy so when you start you car , the gp start . it have shut down cover though , as it have a option for the GPS power after 10 seconds if no power be come from the cl . for constant power car , it would be nice to have a option to have the gp turn off when you car have not move in 10-20 minute . that way the GPS would turn off when you park and leave . while you should probably un-mount the gp while parking on the street for theft reason , this would take care of you garage parking , etc. . of course power on will not be cover , but you can always hit the power switch . \* it do not have any sd or microsd card slot . some people might find this a limitation as other unit have it for audio file , etc. . minor con : \* when connect to a pc , it start off flaky ; sometimes work , sometimes not . the problem seem to be a software driver issue -lrb- I have Vista -rrb- that finally fix itself after I let Windows find a driver on its own . it take several try . \* the unit use a proprietary connector on the supply cable . it be not a Mini-USB . this might be problem only if you lose you cable . \* polarize sunglass can impede you view of the GPS screen . however , this be fairly normal with electronic screen , so not particular to the TomTom brand itself . helpful hint : \* the unit can occasionally have a software hang-up -lrb- as do most brand , so this be not unique to TomTom -rrb- . to reset , press and hold the power button for 15 seconds until a quick drumbeat sound . \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 2 update , August 2011 : Battery die July 2010 : my unit 's internal battery go belly up . I get this unit in November 2010 . after email TomTom they instruct I to return it to they at my cost . they then send I a new unit . deal with customer service be acceptable . not stellar , but not bad . however , find how to file a email claim be challenge on they web site . they want you to try all the faq helpful hint first . while this be understandable , I would prefer the link to customer service be more intuitive . good news ! the `` legal notice '' screen '' have disappear : when I recently connect my unit to get update , I notice the startup screen warn about liability and etc. be finally go . I find the startup `` lawyer screen '' , irritating . yes , I realize I still have to pay attention to the road ; I do not need a screen to remind I about the hazard of distract driving .
GPS	POS	4	unit do a good job with direction . on trip , time compute be way off and correct too slowly . for the price the 510 be a good purchase .
GPS	POS	4	the only thing lack in this item be something that secure the GPS unit inside of the case like a netted pocket or elastic band . otherwise it be a great value for you money & great for travel !
GPS	NEU	3	buy it new for 300 on ebay , it do work well when it work but unfortunatly , it do not always work . there would be time when it just would not turn on . never have any problem with get support from Magellan , but they do not know what to do either . slow to find signal but good in hold it and recalculate when miss exit . again , you get what you pay for and this unit be certaily not woth more then $ 300 .
GPS	NEG	2	I buy this for my boyfriend and it work okay for nearly 2 year . by that time , the unit do not hold a charge at all so it have to be continuously plug in or you would have to plug it in and restart it . also , the map get very out of date and it would have be expensive to upgrade they - I think it would be better to get a new gp , but my bf keep use it until its last die breath , which be rather painful since it seem like every time he take it on a trip with he , when he bring it back the touch screen would not work any more . this make it completely unusable , but then after a while it would decide to start work again . the calibration also get off all the time , so we would start a trip and try to punch in the information and even the security code would be near impossible to type in so it would take forever to unlock it , recalibrate and then finally put in the destination . there be no way either of we would buy a gp again without it have the lifetime map feature , but because of all the problem I be not too sure about buy anything that be a Garmin . right now he be use he iPhone to get drive direction when necessary , which come with it be own unique problem and restriction , and sometimes just he brain which be probably the best if you be at all familiar with the area you be drive but also come with it be own unique problem -lrb- haha -rrb- but definitely search for a stand-alone gp unit that will be better than this be .
GPS	POS	5	I be reluctant to pay more money , consider I see other price hundred less . I recently move to a new state , and need something short of hijack a local to get around . I like to expandability of this middle of the road model . I especially like the portability of it , that I can carry it in my pocketbook or mount it on the car . although I find turn it on take a few hard push on the button-but it still be a great device . it have prove itself especially in traffic when I hit the detour button . it be well worth the money !!!
GPS	POS	5	I purchase this for my 1490t but lose it in like a week . its a good product especially the side pocket on the side . I would just purchase another one at a local store for cheaper tho . it would save you some real $ $ $
GPS	POS	5	I be hesitant to purchase the Garmin 205 as it look bulky . I prefer the 405 , however , be hesitant to spend that amount of money when the review be not absolutely rave about it . anyway , I receive the 205 and start use it the follow day . I absolutely love it ! I do not notice the bulkiness when I be run and it be easy to move between screen . I be primarily use it for interval work and it be great . I want to customize some of the workout and have not quite get that figure out yet , but I think I just need to re-read the instruction . Money well spend and I would definitely buy it again . I be no longer think about the 405 as I be very happy with the 205 .
GPS	POS	5	hello everyone , when we first get we Prism Handspring Visor , we we be debate on if we should get the gp module or not . I be glad we do ! I have find the mapping software very detailed , and I can not wait for the Rand McNally Street Finder map software to come out . I hear that you can do point to point . I highly recommend the handygp concider the functionality and the price . there be so many different feature that you can do . I can not imagine why there have be people that have not enjoy this handy little device . I be able to name my house , my sister house , my favorite restaurant , etc. . . this be a totally cool toy on the cut edge . definetly a must have !
GPS	NEG	1	I purchase the TomTom XXL when it be a Lightning Deal , so I make the mistake of order quickly instead of take time to read all the review . I admit , I get suck in by the low price . well , you get what you pay for . the unit be deliver , the instruction say to just plug it into you computer and tomtomhome will start automatically . I plug in the usb cable and my computer recognize the GPS as a external drive , but that be it . nothing happen . I find the file and install manually , and tomtomhome start up . it immediately want to update the software and map , which be exactly why I would plug it in , so I tell it to go ahead . the software update , but I get a error say that there be not enough space for the map update . so I copy the old map to my computer -lrb- which the software be obviously design to do -rrb- and then install the new map . everything seem to be fine , except that it take literally \* hour \* to install the new map even with my high speed connection . everything seem fine , so I eject the unit , shut down the software , and turn on the unit . no map find . that be it , just a white screen that say `` no map find . '' so I plug it back in and try to find the problem HOME say my map need to be activate . okay , so I click activate and enter my promotion code . I get a little green check mark say that I have enter the correct code . I click the button , and I get a xml error . I try at least a dozen time , no luck , xml error . the error message actually say that my code be correct , but they can not activate my map . I go hunting around online for a solution and discover that this have be a ongoing issue since at least 2004 , and TomTom apparently see no reason why they should fix the problem \* or \* stop advertise that they product be Mac compatible when they clearly be not . I pack it back up in the box and print out a return authorization . my new Garmin Nuvi should be deliver tomorrow . I 'll never buy another TomTom product .
GPS	POS	4	I receive a Garmin Nuvi 350 through Amazon at a substantial savings to best buy , etc. . out of the box I be able to turn it on and use it to find a banquet I have to go to that night . I do not even have to enter the address , I just enter the name of the banquet hall and it take I right there . there be almost no learning curve and it have not let I down yet as far as accuracy . this include a recent trip to Colorado for skiing .
GPS	NEG	2	either the software information on the device be outdate or it be badly flaw as sometimes it choose route that appear go in a near circle . the alternative route would have be much shorter and logical .
GPS	POS	4	when the item work it be great . I have have problem from the first . screen go off . part of picture not there . after 2 hour it just go out . it do not like heat . if you get one without problem it work great . if you follow what it say to go you will not get lose . it do sometime go to place in some different way then I would go . Garmin have state they would fix or replace it if what they tell I to fix it do not work . I would buy again maybe . I have hear of greater problem with other that be not Garmin .
GPS	NEG	2	use rechargeable aaa battery , with the Battery Saver feature turn on , about two hour . sometimes I get more use alkaline , but not much more . honestly , this unit be worthless , because I can not trust the battery . Order a Garmin Etrex Legend instead . it be not much more expensive , larger or heavier , and it include a base map of road , town , and shoreline . the Legend come with a cable to transfer datum from you computer . the Legend 's screen be a bit larger , but show much more detail . and - the battery last hour and hour .
GPS	POS	4	I purchase this item because I want the live traffic and also the step by step direction . the step by step direction be handy in that you can review the turn and direction in order that you can determine howthe gp be navigate you . I have be very happy with this product in that it seem to be right on with traffic delay and arrival time . however , there be one major annoying feature that I absolute dislike . the GPS have advertisement that show up that you can not get rid of . I guess that be how Magellen pay for the free traffic by sell advertisement . after a while you become use to it , but I rather not have it and I wish there be a way to turn it off . another issue that I have experience be that in area of tall building once in a while , like downtown LA , the gp seem to get lose due to lost signal . but in all , I have be very happy with it and it seem very accurate .
GPS	NEG	1	the best part of the design be that it do grip my iphone\/gps very tightly . but , the adhesive base for the dash board do not stick and fall back off after 5 minute of apply it . I do prep the dash first to help the adherence but it do not help . so , I try to use the optional vent clip and as I slide it into the vent to position it the finger of the clip break off and fall down into the vent . I could suction the holder to my windshield , but I buy it to use on my dash board and it just do not cut it . very disappoint . long story short , this product be not worth the $ 8 I pay for it , so beware .
GPS	POS	4	there be many thing I like about this unit -- it be very light and compact , and I find it easy to use . I find the base map surprisingly detailed -lrb- for my area -rrb- , and upload the detailed map from MapSend fill in all the tiny road . now the downer : - mapsend need some lovin ' . I can not just pick the ... baud rate I want ; it must `` discover '' it . interestingly , certain mismatch between what it be try and what the 330 be expect make MapSend crash . just let I pick a number , ... - mapsend do not try anything past 19,200 bp . the thing -lrb- supposedly -rrb- work at 115,200 . - still wait for street map of Europe . - it will not plot a -lrb- street -rrb- course for you . not a big deal for I , but if you primary usage be in a car in place you do not know , you 'll probably want one that draw the `` right turn here '' arrow and talk to you , etc. . . since I use it on the water and for hike the 330 's behavior be just fine -lrb- it can draw a straight line from you present position to any desire locale -rrb- .
GPS	POS	5	this be my third gp and my first Magellan . it be calculate risk purchase on my part because of the way rating spread from best to worse . and after own if for few month I could see why as I have experience the best and not so best of this gp . the first hurdle be register you gp . how you go about obtain free map update be not clearly explain . there be simplify one page instruction paper include that tell what you must do to get access to you free map update . you be to download and install the free content manager software -lrb- pc only . sorry , no mac -rrb- -lrb- the website be print on the paper -rrb- . Register you product with content manager . note : important to have you pn # ready . on mine , the PN # be locate in a very small font , on the lower right corner of Lifetime Map Updates include paper . you will follow the prompt of Content Manager and register you Magellan . after that you right click the Content Manager icon -lrb- not the shortcut -rrb- and click check for Update now and if go well , the content manager software should show what latest map and firmware update you can download . if any other reviewer see error on my part then do please post correction . I find the GPS easy to use and intuitive . when I first start use it I do notice the position lag that other reviewer have post . however , the latest firmware update eliminate that issue completely . once , the GPS freeze on I . if that happen move the power button from on position to reset position and keep it there until the GPS turn off . I live in San Francisco Bay Area and unlike other reviewer I have be pretty satisfy with how it perform . one feature I be not aware of but it be there be when you hit traffic jam a icon will pop up which if you press it will give alternative direction away from the jam . I be use to GPS announce `` recalculate '' whenever I miss a turn but after a while I get use to Magellan just calculate revise direction without the announcement . I guess buy gp be almost a gamble when you think about it . you rely on other reviewer 's experience to help you make the best possible choice but you may still end up with a dud . I be very happy with this purchase .
GPS	POS	5	buy this for ourselves for Christmas . take it on trip from Virginia to unfamiliar part of Florida in late dec\/early Jan. . the 3.5-in screen be plenty large for we . gp be easy to program and mount . only problem come when we mount it on a too cold windshield , and GPS fall off . remount it after windshield have warm up . have to reset gp by turn off , then back on , but it recover like a champ . well please with we nuvi 350 .
GPS	POS	5	I purchase this case for a recently purchase Garmin nuvi 2460LMT -lrb- 5 '' -rrb- . I have purchase Garmin GPS unit in the past and each time Garmin include a protective case . not so with this one . back to Amazon to find a appropriate protective case . there be plenty to choose from but at $ 8.66 incl . tax & delivery , this be it ! fit my Garmin perfectly and just as good as the case Garmin provide in the past . highly recommend .
GPS	POS	5	this thing work great . I be a military soldier and have to run . I have always struggle with my run time for physical fitness test . now I have a virtual partner that keep I on pace and help to inprove my time by keep track of my lap , mileage , and split . get this product . you will not be disappointed !
GPS	NEG	1	I get one of these piece of junk for my birthday a year ago - I think it have work a total of once . first , the mount arm do not keep the product at a angle where it can be view . I contact TomTom and they tell I that my mount arm be not part of a recall of mount arm - so I have to buy a new one . I do - twice - neither work . I call TomTom again and they tell I that the mount arm frequently malfunction when the temperature be over 80 degree - I live in Texas - the temperature be over 80 degree 6 month of the year . next , I have to constantly restart the TomTom - it seem to not like to work for more than a couple of hour at a time . then , yesterday , I try to restart it and nothing happen so I box the whole thing up -lrb- 3 docking arm and all -rrb- and mail it back to TomTom . save you money - get a Garmin !
GPS	POS	5	this 5 '' nuvus be the best I have have so far . the standard Garmin ease of operation along with the increase size make it a perfect aid in travel and navigation . the add Traffic Update feature be very helpful miss the backup around Atlanta 2 week ago while come home from Tampa . I will not travel without it !
GPS	POS	5	very nice setup , come with ac adapter , car charger and window suction mount . if you do not follow it be direction it recaluclate almost immediately with new one . huge pre-built datum base of gas station , restaurant , hotel etc. . type in any address and it find it . come with entire US build in , so you do not need to upload map to it as you travel to new area . only negative be that it be a little hard to read in direct sunlight and like all similar product it sometimes miss a more direct route . I be very impressed with it .
GPS	POS	5	the Go 910 be definitely the best gp device out there today . I use it on a long sojourn on the East Coast over the fourth of July weekend and it never miss . before I leave I load up a bunch of playlist onto the device with plenty of room to spare !! before I leave I be concern about the mount droop in the hot weather . I do not know if people have try this , but you have to turn the dial on the mount such that it click in twice . there be a first click , then dial farther until the padlock symbol meet the dot . even in the 90-degree weather the dock do not move . voice have some trouble with street name , but still , with the text-to-speech it be nice to have something more than the generic `` turn right here . '' love the big screen , better than Nuvi 360 and the Streetpilot c550 , my next turn be always visible well in advance . phone conversation be clear and map accuracy be fine . a great product !
GPS	POS	4	this case work very well on the handlebars of my road bicycle or my mountain bike . I dont worry at all about it fall because it be so well shield in this case . the only thing that I can really find wrong with it be that when you put the NUVI in the case , you can hardly hear the voice speak to you . of course , if the voice be not that important to you , then there be no problem at all : -rrb-
GPS	POS	4	I have use my TomTom a few time since purchase it , so not a lot of experience . it be most helpful on the road , but do have some street name and address that be in error . I have issue try to get the lifetime map code to activate - it take several try with error message to get it to take . the download of the new map be very slow , until I move to a faster wifi spot , and then when it do download and install it would not work - problem at TomTom 's end . I be wait for a good 1\/2 hour on the phone for support before be help . I have find that use online support be a much better way to get tech support and question answer . the reply I receive , and step that be detail in the email , be most helpful . for the price pay , I really like the unit ... especially the idea of Lifetime Maps . hopefully the unit will lead a long life , to take advantage of those update : -rrb-
GPS	POS	5	it be very easy to use . Easy to set up . very exact with instruction . graphic and sound be just right . I highly recommend this product .
GPS	POS	4	this be my fifth gp unit . my first GPS unit be a Lowrance gm100 follow by a Garmin and a Magellan Sportrak and then a Lowrance go2 . all have be good unit . I be very inpress when I first receive the Lowrance h20 unit . I be impress by the screen size first and foremost . second , I be pleasantly suprised to find the car power adapter . shortly after purchase the unit , I buy the software package . it include the map software , a 64mb sd card and the card reader . I be very happy with the set , but I would have prefer a direct cable connection to the unit as oppose to have to use the card reader to transfer datum . the software be also somewhat limit in feature as well . I would like to see more feature involve trail . the map be great and very accurate . transfer datum work great but be somewhat difficult in that you must remove the card which require removal of the battery . I would give the unit five star if it be not for the above limitation . if you just look at the unit itself base on accuracy and useability , it definitely rank five star .
GPS	NEU	3	the item be ok but I hate the fact that I be get pop-up advertisement when it come on . it also have some mis information in it as do my old one which sometimes lead I into never never land .
GPS	NEG	1	this do not charge you Garmin . it only provide power to the GPS . DO NOT buy this if you be expect it to charge you battery in you gp . my battery steadily lose power as it be plug into this device . the seller be great though and refund my money without I even ask and obviously mistake can happen . just make sure you device charge if that be what you be look to buy .
GPS	POS	4	my first unit have a defective radio and Garmin swap it out and save my waypoint . suggest you buy ear bud w \/ PTT mic . my hunting party use they and it coordinate we hunt accurately especially send waypoint . bring battery since 6hr seem to be useable time . if money be not a issue buy 530 model since the radio power be 5 watt versus 1\/2 watt and the togel switch be easier to use . overall it make hunting with a group better .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin nuvus 350 be a great gp for the money . it be very easy to use and have great feature . we buy it to give to we oldest son as he be leave for college , which give we peace of mind as parent . I highly recommend it . Dan -lrb- Kansas City , MO -rrb-
GPS	NEG	2	bottom warped and constantly slide off dash . Poor product . I would not recomend it . Navgear have a better dash mopunt .
GPS	NEG	1	not a item to be use with a pc for the tracking download . have to remove Garmin software from pc , it keep lock my pc down !
GPS	NEG	1	great idea and form factor let down by miserable online experience , weak user interface and poor service feature . specifically , as note by other reviewer , Garmin 's online service be more frequently down than available - consequently the ability to track you precious item\/pet be meaningless as you be unable to query the system more than , by my estimate , 20 % of the time -lrb- I have be flagging this to Garmin for the past 5 day but who , for the time be , deny that there be any issue with they service availability -rrb- . the track history be only available for 24 hour unless you buy a higher-level package - combine this with the fact that you can not actually access the history for more than a fraction of when you need , you might as well not bother . there be multiple other gp tracking system -lrb- eg the spot  SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger unit  and quality -lrb- better gp recognition and reporting -rrb- . I will be return my Garmin GTU 10 to the shop at the weekend as I have simply have enough of waste my time try to get Garmin to recognize they be disappointing customer .
GPS	NEG	1	my holder break after use for a month . it have a design problem . there be a very strong spring inside the holder ' four screw be place in each side of the holder to place two plastic part together . there be nothing to support the two plastic part together in the middle where they place the spring at . what happen to my holder be that the plastic deform due to the strong tension inside . I be very disappointed at this product , since I be plane to drive one of my friend to the airport that day .
GPS	POS	5	I have have the product for a couple of month . this product be great and do everything advertise . all function appear to be quite accurate . yes it be not fashionable , but its a fair tradeoff for the map and compass function that come in really handy when hike . everything be very intuative . the only complaint I have about the product be the 1 + min startup time require to locate the GPS satellite .
GPS	POS	4	. . as should be obvious , know exactly where you be be equally as important as know exactly where you need to be . as a Sonet Technician , I purchase this unit to help find communication site in obscure , often desolate area of the eastern US . in the past , I have to rely upon either someone whom have never actually be there and use a web-based mapping site to issue turn-by-turn direction , or people recall the location from memory , `` I think you turn at  , then look for the concrete cow on the left which mean you just pass the turn so go back and turn right . '' neither be very accurate , so I begin use my laptop and try out a number of mapping program . I settle on m 's Streets & Trips 2000 due to the ease with which I could open a window of save point , double click on the one I need and find they automatically enter as waypoint -lrb- a feature inexplicably remove from subsequent release -rrb- . use a mapping program alone work fairly well , but the flaw be that once I miss a turn -- most often in the dead of night -- I have to determine where I be in order to find my way back to the plot course . terribly frustrating and confusing to be look for route 773 and be surround by route 377 , 737 , 337 , etc. . . this be a perfect application of a GPS unit as it can save literally dozen of hour per year of time lose to backtrack .  my decision to purchase the Magellan brand come of a friend 's recommendation of a map 330 and of distil fact from diatribe on number of gps-related bbss . instead of explore the merit -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- of one mfgr \ model over another , these discussion typically degenerate into little more than flame war . anyway ... I purchase a Magellan Meridian platinum at the local CompUSA for considerably more than I would have pay have I order it from Amazon . CompUSA stock neither the vehicle mount bracket nor the data\/power cable accessory on the day i purchase the unit .  when I first power up the unit , I be indoors and quite disappointed that I get no satellite lock whatsoever . however , it quickly find my location once I step outside and have a unobstructed view of the sky . I discover that the unit work less than perfectly unless hold vertically and that even a single finger place over the antenna section substantially degrade reception . I enter into m Streets & Trips 2002 -lrb- st2k2 -rrb- the lat-long location datum for the 14 site we need to visit between Atlanta and Jax , fl . use the include datum cable , I connect the Meridian platinum to the laptop , then run the GPS setup . I be on the road in minute . find the site be a piece of cake for the most part , though it do take a while to get use to the update lag time . st2k2 's help file explain that the software poll the GPS only every 15 seconds , mathematically account for what I find to be a average of nearly 1\/3 mile error in position . from then on , I have the driver slow down 1\/2 mile before each turn . when we do miss turn thereafter , it be only because st2k2 's map be not entirely accurate -lrb- particularly around Athens , GA -rrb- .  i find myself constantly check the battery power display and wish I have the data\/power cable . be forwarn that the Meridian platinum eat battery for lunch . I burn four per day -lrb- two set -rrb- over a four day period , average only slightly more than a halflife of what the documentation state ; I get no more than about eight hour from a fresh set of high quality alkaline . certainly the ability to turn off the unit 's display would dramatically increase battery life . I find no reference to do such in the . pdf manual . this be a oversight in my opinion , but undoubtedly can be correct in a software update from Magellan .  because the mount bracket be not available at the time I make my purchase , I have to leave the Meridian on the dashboard . from this arise a number of problem . the gp be occasionally power down when bump in rough backroad cause it to bounce around and depress the power button . also , it frequently lose satellite lock due in part to such jostle , but more to the fact that it be impossible to have a unobstructed view of the sky inside the cab of a large truck and that it can not be hold vertically without the mount bracket . another consequence of be on the dash be that the unit become \* extremely \* hot when expose to direct sunlight . so hot , in fact , I become concerned that such tremendous heat might be damaging . while it seem no less the worse for wear , I would rather it not get that hot in the first place . I believe the simplest solution to these problem be not a mount bracket , but a external antenna -- the expensive unit can then sit safely tuck out of harm 's way . unfortunately , the Meridian line do not provide for the direct connection of a external antenna , and this alone might be reason enough to warrant a return for refund . I find it tremendously annoy that the designer would disallow such a option .  i buy a unit much more capable than I actually need or will ever use , so my advice to those new to gpss be that you take you time and fully investigate the function you need , carefully research the function that several different vendor and they unit provide , then , once you have decide on what you want , stop and research a little more . if at all possible , borrow a friend 's or rent a number of different model for a few day . I can not knock the Meridian platinum because it have more feature than I 'll ever use , and I be certain backpacker and geocacher will love this thing , but the lack of a external antenna port must be take into account . this can not be overstate : if the primary use of you gp receiver will be inside a vehicle , look for something else .  i award the Magellan Meridian platinum 4 of 5 star .  pro : Works well , seem quite rugged , have numerous cool feature , and will give owner obvious brag rights . con : lack external antenna capability , a bit spendy , and eat battery like M&M; s.
GPS	POS	4	I finally replace my old heart rate monitor with this gp device . I like it a lot as it show I the vitals that I need to keep on push further . I have not explore all the feature but I be happy with the basic that it provide I so far .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin nuvi 1450 GPS work great . the direction be clear and easy to follow . we use the index of attraction while on vacation and the unit be easy to program and very user friendly . the screen be large enough to see the map .  Garmin nuvi 1450 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator
GPS	POS	5	great product ! instruction leave a lot to be desire for novice computer people . very unclear instruction about download datum to computer and which program be best to use . . vague at best and inadequate at worst . thanks gary Johnson
GPS	POS	4	you can not tell this be not a brand new unit . it even have the warranty . it keep a lock even in deep wood . the map be a big help but would not be necessary if people would give parking co-ordinate ! my only complaint about this unit be that the sp card fall out when I change battery .
GPS	POS	5	I have be with Garmin since my first gp . I have the Garmin Nuvi 265T and it work well for I until the map have expire and I have to pay to purchase a map . I figure if I purchase the map , my total for what I pay for the gp plus the map will be equal to buy a newer gp . my friend let I use she Garmin 765T and it be wonderful . I have always believe that the Garmin system be very user-friendly , and it be the reason why I do not want to switch manufacturer . however , whenever I look at the newer model , it seem that I have to pay more for a new Garmin unit which have less feature than what other manufacturer brand be offer . I look around and the TomTom XXL 540tm really take my interest . I keep on look around and read all the review here and it seem like it be easier for I to accept its con than what I have read in other GPS unit . I wait for black Friday Sale to get a unit . I check Amazon 's price and think that be the best deal , but I see that Staples be offer the unit at the same price on black Friday so I decide to get it from Staples . I pay extra for sale tax but I be able to get the unit right away as compare with wait for 5-8 business day before delivery from Amazon -lrb- no , I be no longer a prime member -rrb- . pro : 1 . I like the wide screen . I have own the Nuvi 265T forever and it be a small screen compare to what I have with TomTom XXL . 2 . the lifetime map be very much appreciate . at least I know that I 'll never have to worry about my map be outdate . 3 . the traffic update be very helpful . I be drive home from NJ to md and it take I away from all the road congestion of people come home after Thanksgiving break and all the toll road be congest . the garmin I use have traffic feature in they but I have never experience anything helpful with it as what I have with my new TomTom . : -rrb- 4 . I like how it show I the total time and the total distance . I drive to NJ every weekend and I get impatient look at the Garmin GPS that I use because it would show I the number of mile I need to drive to reach a certain point on my trip and then when I finish drive those mile , I get another set of mile and it just feel endless . for a 3-hour -lrb- or more -rrb- every weekend , it can make I very impatient not know how much progress I be make with my drive . my new TomTom show I the total time and distance I need to drive , plus the number of mile I would be drive to reach segment of my trip . 5 . the TomTom XXL 540tm have a drive break suggestion ! awesome ! 6 . I like the audio quality better than the GPS unit I have use before . 7 . TomTom HOME be very user-friendly and make the GPS very easy to customize . con : 1 . I be use to the ease of mount of the Garmins . I own a Garmin friction mount so I never worry about mount the Garmin on the windshield . even so , it be never difficult to mount the garmin on the windshield . they be always easy to mount and to remove . I have a different luck with the TomTom . I have to get help mount it on the windshield because I be have difficulty turn the thing to make the suction thing stick to the windshield . then I have to keep it on the windshield once we be able to make it stick because I find it difficult to have to put it back there and remove it whenever I be not use the gp . then there be the challenge of put the GPS unit itself on the mount everytime I need to use it . it never take I less than thrice to make it stay mount on the mount . 2 . the traffic update only work when the unit be plug in to the charger . for some reason , I wish it work even when not plug in because it be always better to work with a gp wireless , right ? : -rrb- 3 . it do not really bother I , but for the benefit of other , this do not have bluetooth and expandable memory card slot . so far I have not encounter problem with not have enough space on the unit to update my map since I get it . so far , these be what I have observe . I be glad I decide to get a TomTom instead of another Garmin . I love all the feature and I definitely recommend it . : -rrb-
GPS	POS	4	Thought about purchase a gp system for quite awhile but could not decide which one . daughter and she husband recommend a Garmin and after look they over and read other review decide this be what we need to have in the vehicle my husband use for business and then I use it to find a store . now we discuss who get to use it !
GPS	POS	4	we really like this other than we find out we can not enter in exact coordinate which have turn out to be a problem . you can get coordinate for almost every place but we can not enter they in on this device which be a problem live here in Germany when you want to go to Spain or France etc. . I can get the coordinate to site we want to visit on google but it be not so easy to get a address and even when you do they very so much by country it be hard to get to the location .
