Headphone	POS	4	I buy these for a long plane ride to St. Thomas . I use they with my ipod and I be very happy with my purchase . the volume level be great . I never need to raise the volume past 2\/3rd 's on my ipod . I try several headphone include my friend 's qc2 's and even though he sound quality may be slightly better , I could not get the volume on the bose to go high enough to enjoy watch a movie on my ipod . however , the sound quality on these Sennheiser 's be far better than anything else I have try in the past . also , even after use they for 3 hour , my ear do not hurt and they never get hot or sweaty . as far as the noise cancel part , BOSE win hand down . but it be still ok . it do a fair job of reduce jet engine noise , but do not cancel out voice around you . the main reason that I even buy these be because Consumer Reports rate they as a best buy overall . I can definetely see why .
Headphone	NEG	2	the Bonging Sound Noise when you use the + volume control - be very annoying and it drive ME NUTS . now I do not use the headset volume + when I want to increase the volume - I have resort to have to use the ipod volume control - this be annoying also since I be suppose to be able to use the headset control . maybe I be just too picky .
Headphone	NEG	1	this be probably the worst frackalakin piece of blacoopa i have eva wakalaking snakin ever get . I mean this headphone so bad its be very bad . I hate its headphone gut . you understand I heaphone I hate you soo much you can go die in a frazinglining hole .
Headphone	NEU	3	after play video game and listen to music with these headphone constantly for the past 3 day , I would rate they 3.5 out of five star if possible , add the extra .5 for the nice fit\/construction construction : for a pair of over the head , full size headphone , these do feel very light , and snug withought be too tight . the cord be thin , and the length be a nice medium . as you can see in the picture the ear fold up and inward into the headband to keep these somewhat portable . there be a very convenient net that keep the folding headband from snag you hair , as well as contribute to the nice snug fit feeling . sound : the sound in general be mediocre . they do sound good , but I have a feeling that some of the increase in quality I be experience be simply because I be use to you standard non-enclosed headphone . I notice the base be strong in video game , but not in music . for example , Whenever I play say , Battlefield 2142 ... the explosion , heavy artillery fire\/tank shell , and the thud ground-pound of the mech walk around sound fantastic , but they tend to overpower other sound effect . however , when play music -lrb- 128 kbp AAC 's -rrb- I do not notice the super-strong base , however it do sound better than you standard headphone . it should be note that 128kbp be not full quality music , yet it have become the standard for download for file size vs. quality . Price vs. performance : it be a nice balance . you be not spend very much on these , and you be get performance may not be great , but certainly not bad . my opinion be that if you be on a budget or not willing to spend a whole lot on headphone , but want to make sure you be get decent sound quality , then these be a solid and justifiable buy . however , if you be a impulsive buyer , be strong and just hold off until you can afford to spend more . this be my first pair of enclosed-ear headphone and while satisfied for now , I foresee a newer , probably twice as expensive pair in my not too distant future .
Headphone	POS	5	I buy these for my son , after he very extensive research into find the best quality headphone on the market . without a doubt , these be not only a great value for the price but in any price range . the sound be amazing ! as a hat off to Amazon : these be actually a little hard to find ... not only do you have they , but they be at a discounted price . they also arrive on the exact date on the shipping confirmation .
Headphone	NEU	3	I buy this for watch the tv . the sound quality be amazing . I like the head set overall . the only problem be , you have to tune every time you power on the headset . it will not save the frequency once you set it . good for those who want to watch tv or play game with best sound .
Headphone	POS	5	awesome . amazing . comfortable . gorgeous sound . be it worth the steep price ? well , the money would be waste on doe-eyed soft-haired teen idol but definitely well spend Pink Floyd ! ; -rrb-
Headphone	NEG	1	Review update after 6 + month of product ownership : have use these on 6 domestic trip about 2 international trip of 8 + hr to Europe and Asia . I try the bose qc-15 for about 2 week and then I have now use these for 2 trip ... and here be my conclusion : 1 -rrb- Noise Cancelling : these be no bose ... there be a significant different between the Noise cancelling of this one vs. the bose . so you get what you pay for . these do not seem to get rid of all the `` white noise '' like on a airplane etc. . noise be my primary need ... and these do a ok job but not outstanding . 2 -rrb- comfort : Bose win ... these SUCK . wear these on a extended flight and after about 2 hour , with Audio Technica , I have to keep take they off to give my ear some rest . this part be really annoying and that be why I have change my review from 3 star to 1 star . after 2 hour , you ear will be burn ... the stretch band across the top be not long enough and will start to dig into you brain ... just miserable on comfort what good be any other feature of noise cancel if these can not be worn . 3 -rrb- music : not my specialty . both play music , with Audio-Technica , the good thing be that it play even when it be turn off ... so if you battery die on a long trip , you can still use these for listen to you music , but with bose , you would be SOL . 4 -rrb- cost : these be about half of the bose ... so you get what you pay for . on further consideration , because of the comfort issue , you do not want to use these after a while , so you do not really even get what you pay for at half the price . I do not want these to get cheaper ... but why can not these guy make they more comfortable . who decide to make the head-strap to NOT be very long ? who decide not to use the softer padding over the ear ? and why be not the ear-cup a little bigger to surround my ear better . I be ready to try on-ear model and see how that do . Consumer Reports rate even the Audio-Technica on-ear model better than these . what a disappointment , do not waste you money . I 'll be put mine up for sale on e-bay if anyone want they .
Headphone	POS	4	first , the good part . these be the second set of Jensen headphone I have purchase . they be a very good value compare to some of the other I have try . the downside be that the signal will very slowly drift over the life of the battery , but usually a slight tap of the tuning knob will bring it back . the newer model like this one appear to have better signal aquisition , so this may solve some of the drift problem I see in older model . battery life be pretty good , I usually go through a set every 6-7 day on the old one . -lrb- the old model require 3 aaa 's instead of 2 however -rrb-  now the bad , the production value be rather poor on the electronics in these headphone . my first pair start go rather glitchy on I , sometimes I would have to lightly hit the side to get they to find the signal again , and the battery life start go down drastically . it also would rapidly lose signal when it have this problem . I take they apart and notice that the soldering job be quite substandard , and there be several uninsulated speaker wire that be short out . after put some insulation in on the board , the headphone start work perfectly . I take these apart after I recieve they and notice the same problem . the headphone be also pop loose from its plastic fitting due to substandard glue . both easily fixable if you be good with electronics .
Headphone	POS	4	pro : relatively inexpensive comparatively sound great comfortable even with my big head keep outside noise out pretty well Cons : velour earpad can make you head HOT outside of headphone have no noise dampen - anyone nearby can hear what you be listen to I be happy with the headphone in spite of the con - because at pretty much any volume the headphone put out sound through the back of the earpad and anyone nearby can hear . I wish the velour earpad do not turn my head into a furnace , but all over the ear headphone be bad to some extent , and the velour be more comfortable . people complain about the long cord but I have come to expect that with high quality headphone and it be actually beneficial in one scenario so I 'll live with it . if you want great sound at a reasonable price and do not care if anyone else would get bother by the noise , then these be a great buy .
Headphone	NEU	3	good for speech or other non music use . plastc headband not very comfortable for extend use . low price make this headset disposable and worth buying . probably good for kid use .
Headphone	POS	5	first let I say great review J. governalus . for the fool sit in you room think these be go to block out you mom yell at you ... try read the manual . if you have not try the noise cancel on a airplane or another noisy low freq form of transportation , do not write a review .
Headphone	POS	4	these headphone have work great . my husband love they because he can hear the show better and I love they because the tv be not roar and hurt my ear anymore . they charge easily and have great range . Terrific product .
Headphone	POS	4	i take away a star because the bud get a little uncomfortable after a couple of hour and i do not like the intermediate connection in the headphone wire . the sound quality be excellent for use with a laptop\/mp3 player . great for jogging and workout . no noise reduction feature but it be much safer that way at the gym and the road .
Headphone	POS	5	this be a great idea to swim listen to music i be so glad i buy this
Headphone	NEU	3	do not let the name sennheiser fool you . this product be make in China . I be excite about get these earbud , see the name Sennheiser and think it be a bargain at the price . well , there be a reason . so I be try to prevent the next person from make the same mistake . these be NOT German make earbud . other critique : not as comfortable in the ear as other have suggest . I can wear it for 2 hour before my ear start hurt . sound quality not any more special then standard apple earbud . most importantly : durability . how long will these earbud last I until one or both side go deaf ? I do not know , I just get these . I will come back to this review to let you know . sennheiser do offer 2 year warranty , so that be good .
Headphone	POS	4	I have be use these ear bud and I like they both at home and at work . they work well to reduce the constant hum of nearby computer , distant conversation etc. . they help I keep my train of thought . I also like the fact that I can save my ear because I do not have to turn up music as high . chatter beyond 10ft away mostly disappear . I be surprise by the static buzz they produce , but the noise cancel outweigh that . type seem to stand out as the most audible noise . it seem to work best on constant rumble or hum noise . it seem as if everything noisy around you get push back 20 foot . UPDATE : the left earbud stop work . Sony will gladly replace the set for a processing fee of $ 46 . I be downgrade this product from 4 star to 1 star .
Headphone	NEU	3	they be ok . for $ 15 or so , they be great for the price but as a whole , just ok . I prefer my phillip in ear `` virtual surround sound '' better .
Headphone	POS	5	I also own a pair of the sr60us headphone , which be just a step below in quality and price , so I be already a fan of Grado before I buy these . I want to try other type of headphone that might offer some measure of sound isolation -lrb- the Grados famously have a `` open '' design , so in term of isolation , listen to they be akin to have a boombox tape to you head -rrb- . to this end , I try various in-ear headphone and some closed over-ear one . long story short , nothing in the -lrb- $ 200 range come even close to sound as fun as my sr60i . the only logical place to go be higher on the Grado spectrum , and so I try the sr80i . since I be not a audiophile , I 'll try to do my best to describe they sound in mostly imprecise term . First of all , both the sr60us and the sr80us be literally revelatory - they show up new detail in familiar recording that the speaker and earbud I be use before I find the Grados be too stodgy to handle . they render all part of the frequency spectrum with aplomb . the deep subbass on Shackleton 's fabric 55 recording sound incredibly tight and controlled . Electric guitar , which reside mostly in the midrange , sound particularly embody , with a fully realize attack , something I sorely miss in more expensive headphone like the monster turbine . the cymbal on Miles Davis ' ` bitch brew ' be smooth , not harsh . most importantly , these headphone be just fun to listen to . they bring everything , even album I have grow tired of , alive . and they do this consistently , perhaps because Grado 's emphasis seem to be on musicality and not just by-the-numbers fidelity . there be two definite minus , both of which be flip side to the same design decision that give rise to they amazing sound , namely the fact that they be open -lrb- the earpiece chamber have large grilled vent -rrb- . forget about listen to these on plane , since they do not block any outside sound . also , they basically broadcast what you be listen to , and hence be unsuitable for office or library . many have complain that they be uncomfortable - my girlfriend find that the earpad hurt she ear after a hour of listen - but I find they eminently comfortable and can wear they indefinitely without problem , so that may be a matter of individual head shape or ear size . be the sr80us worth the $ 20 premium over the sr60us ? they look identical in all respects and appear to have the same specification and outward construction , so it come down to the sound . my sr80us be tighter , more controlled and at the same time , deeper , when it come to bass reproduction in comparison to my sr60us . Make no mistake , the sr60us be no slouch and never allow the bass to boom and overwhelm other part of the spectrum , but it just feel slightly looser and more elastic . the difference be subtle , but definite , and over long period of listen , I believe the sr80us will justify the extra expense . lastly , I should reiterate one negative that many people have mention . if you be not one of those people who tend to buy expensive audio equipment , get a pair of these might , by open you up to a world of gorgeous sound , lead to a rather expensive hobby .
Headphone	NEG	1	when you turn on the noise cancel feature you can hear a very low rumble sound . I try these on a airplane and several other white noise environment , like fan blow . when compare these to regular headphone , there be no difference at all . a coworker let I try he bose noise cancel headset and that do make a noticeable difference . the noise cancel feature of these philip headphone appear to be worthless . the comfort and quality of these as just regular headphone be ok , but why would you buy these unless you want the noise cancel feature ?
Headphone	POS	5	I have a pair of these after my Sennheiser 's from college die finally -lrb- and I graduate in 1988 -rrb- . now I need another pair because my new dog eat MY FIRST PAIR !! the best thing about these , besides the fact that they be comfortable and the sound be great be the 6 meter cord with its own volume control that you can clip to you -lrb- that about 18 foot , so I can be across the room from a tv instead of 4 foot away like most headphone -rrb- . yes , thank you , I have try wireless . much more expensive and I be cheap and do not mind the cord . these rock . buy a pair , now . no , really , I mean it . make it 2 if you have a dog that like to eat cord ...
Headphone	POS	4	I order this pair of headphone for my Motorola Triumph smartphone . so far I do not have real complaint . under normal noise level the ambient noise be greatly isolate and I can hear music or person in the phone w\/o any problem . people tell I I sound a little muffle but they can understand I w\/o and problem . in noisy situation -lrb- I have worn these while mow the lawn as well as while ride my motorcycle -rrb- I still get ambient noise come through - but I can still hear the music very well . I do not play my music very loud ... usually only at around 50 % and I wear a 1\/2 helmet so I know that there be a lot of noise when I be ride . I have not have to take any call while on the bike so I be not too sure how well they will perform in that situation . the in-the-ear bud be comfortable and they stay in my ear even when I be very active . the headset come with several different tip for I to select the right size for I .
Headphone	POS	4	cant beat this . overall good headphone for the money . sound quality be ok and isolation from the outside world be ok as well . everyone can hear only if turn up on the loud side but over all this be a good product .
Headphone	NEG	1	the sound quality of these headphone be relatively poor but that be not why I return they . the range be about 25 foot on the same floor and then loud static would come and go at different location in the house . this be very consistent . in the basement they be useless . I replace they with a set by rca model wph150 for $ 30 less and the sound be much better and no problem anywhere in the house .
Headphone	POS	5	great sound , comfortable though they pinch my ear a bit after more than a hour .
Headphone	POS	4	I really like sennheiser because they sell quality product at reasonable price . these headphone be no exception . I get it at $ 21 , which be a steal . the sound quality be almost as good as a $ 70 pair of headphone I be use before . when compare these to bose QuietComfort 15 acoustic , the bose be noticeably better . but , I pay $ 21 vs. $ 300 it cost for the bose . my only complaint be that these headphone have the bass frequency slightly increase . I be from the old-school and do not believe in use a equalizer or change the frequency . regardless , these headphone be great . and to truly enjoy they , use they to listen to you favorite cd -lrb- mp3 will do these headphone no justice -rrb- .
Headphone	NEU	3	the headphone perform the task , sound quality be not as good as a wire connection would be
Headphone	NEG	1	I just send these back and order the 170 . there be way too much hissing . it be extremely annoying . I try switch channel a million time , move the base , etc. . occasionally it would work and I would have great sound for a minute , but then come the hissing . I really hope the 2.4 ghz of the 170s do not have this problem .
Headphone	POS	5	the headphone have perfect overall sound quality . I really like the deep bass I be get . the headphone block most of the noise outside and actually stay on my ear . in all these aspect , it be better than any pair of in-the-ear headphone I have use in the past . this be much better than I hope . at this price I would say this be a perfect deal .
Headphone	POS	5	I have buy many of this headphone already they be pretty gud what suck be that the black one be cheaper than the white one and they be both the same . I think both should cause the same
Headphone	POS	4	these headphone and other -lrb- in some different color , and design -rrb- can be find at you local dollar store . that a savings of 88 cent . so get and up go there !
Headphone	POS	5	this be the first wireless headphone i even have . it work great and the sound quality be good . the price be reasonable too . recommend this wireless headphone for anyone who be look for budget wireless with good quality .
Headphone	NEU	3	for the price I buy the headphone for they be acceptable and work well enough . the biggest problem I have have so far be that for some reason the signal seem to be interfere with my wireless internet . my internet connection do not work within the range of the docking station for the headphone , and as soon as I turn off the unit my internet connection be fine again . I mostly watch movie and tv show through the internet , so this be a problem for I . otherwise they work fine and be comfortable enough . if you do not need to use the internet while you be use the headphone then they be a good price for what you get . and it be nice to be able to charge the headphone instead of have to put in new battery .
Headphone	POS	5	for about $ 10 , these be a bargain !! I buy the blue version of these on Amazon for the purpose of act as a backup pair of headphone for my $ 40  Skullcandy TiTAN 's -lrb- black -rrb-  I get they because they be recommend from Consumer Reports , and I be impressed . the sound quality rival that of my top-notch TiTAN 's , and they fit much better in my ear than the TiTAN 's . my friend say they be much more durable than the other $ 10 headphone she be have in the past ; very sturdy for the price . the only thing I and she be concern about be how the silicone bud be slightly flimsy , but , then again , these be only $ 10 . but for $ 10 , you could not find a better pair of headphone . UPDATE : I have go through 2 pair of these thing since I first buy they . I wash my 1st pair , & go awhile without another pair like this . when I order my second pair , I realize again what I have be miss . the bass be not as full as my  sennheiser cx300 ii  the treble be richer , however . and these thing can stand a lot of abuse . as long as the beating be not abnormal , the only real reason you would buy another pair be because you lose they .
Headphone	POS	4	they be ship and receive when promise . the sound be very good . the only negative be the cost to send they to I -lrb- postage be way out of line -rrb-
Headphone	NEG	2	these be not adjustable in any way . the speaker part be so huge and the hook be too big to fit snugly over my ear to keep they in place . after about 20 minute I be have to take they off they hurt so bad . I would return they if I could ! love the Nike Vapor white plastic one . very adjustable and lightweight .
Headphone	POS	4	Orderd headphone 20 $ arrived in 4 day free shipping over 25 $ . read alot of review and figure what the hey and be right , I have a large head 7 3\/4 I think and a full bushy head of hair and when I see headphone I think no way r these thing go to fit . if you pull down hard on each ear pad they extend to a very large size and fit very nice , iam 1 notch from the largest setting and think they would fit a 8 size head . the sound be ok because the bass be a little to strong on classic rock but if u use a equalizer u can work around this problem . the 10 foot cord be great and the noise canceling be not really good . work on a computer u can here tv and phone ringing and other people can here what u r listen to but it be a low volume . they be so comfortable and do not squish my ear because my ear fit perfctly inside the pad . im wonder if all the other comment of major pressure on head and not fitting at all , if they realize u can extend the earpad to a very large head ? all in all worth the 20 $ 4\/5
Headphone	POS	5	description of product as state . I have walk around my house with the headphone on and have have perfect reception to listen to my favorite movie or music . excellent product !
Headphone	POS	5	i get these for 15 buck and i wont go back its awesome although sort of cheap and break easily its alright though because you have a warranty
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be my workhorse headphone . they be open , which mean I do not miss the dinner bell or the phone ringing . they sound great , be very light , and , to shock some people , be rather comfortable . yes , I say it , these headphone be comfortable ! this be my first Grado purchase , and I enjoy they so much I have to try the rs2us 's and I end up get they too ! sound : 4.5 \/ 5 Grado headphone be know to favor the midrange and be fast respond headphone . definitely true . Bass be there , but compare to the mid and high , its the most lack . I do not find this a major distraction , as I do not crave massive bass , and I have a portable amp that can boost bass if absolutely necessary when a basshead want to try it out and complain about lack of bass . if you enjoy rock and do not need eardrum-rattling bass , give these a try ! comfort : 5\/5 call I crazy , but these be the most comfortable headphone I have . most people complain about the ear pad and the headband , but I find the headband to be just fine , and the ear pad give more cushion than my rs2us 's , at a slight tradeoff of muffle sound a tiny bit -lrb- not too drastic , after use the headphone for 80 + hour you do not really notice it anymore -rrb- . I do not mod my headphone , but if you be willing to , these will become even more comfortable to you , and at the price-point of these headphone , it be still quite affordable for those in the know about higher quality headphone . value : 5\/5 they might not be the greatest overall sound headphone at they price-point , and some may complain about they comfort , but I find this a great deal . it be in the middle of it be class , one that span from $ 80 to $ 300 , this be around $ 150 . some people start to listen to Grado and wonder how the higher end headphone sound , so start off with something like the sr80us to sr225us and if you get curious you can still afford to step up to a wooden Grado set , which Grado aficionado state you need for a true Grado headphone sound .
Headphone	POS	4	I be attract by these earphone for a couple reason . First of all I break my Sony earbud , I lose my apple earphone , and I do not like carry around my bose on-ear headphone . pro - fit comfortably sound decent -lrb- equal to any apple earphone , or my previous Sony in-ear -rrb- do its job con - have slight hissing noise , but I have always have a good sense of hearing , so might just be I have a bump on the outer ear part 3.5 mm jack from earbud be slightly large , well approx . 1.5 inch all in all . it be a decent product . I would not recommend this to anyone because I prefer actual headphone oppose to earphone , but if you be on the go , it be a decent product . experience : 1.5 week
Headphone	POS	5	cheap and just as good as bose qc ! well worth the price !!! Have have no problem with remanufactured goods from amazon !
Headphone	POS	5	I really like these headphone , they fit in my ear perfectly . I just buy my second pair of they because the first one do break after a year but for the price it be well worth it . the sound quality be great and you can get like 10 for the price of some of the expensive headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	I just get these on sale for $ 24 . I be a little discourage to hear people write that they hurt they ear because I always seem to have that problem with headphone . I be big -lrb- 6 ' 7 '' -rrb- and I do not have small ear , but for $ 24 I figure what the heck . I be glad I ignore those review because I do not have any problem . I have have mine on now for the last 3 hour with no problem . the sound be quality be great and so be the bass response . there be a few hip hop song I have listen to and be completely suprise by they ability to hit some of the low frequency . best pair of headphone I have ever own in the -lrb- $ 60 range .
Headphone	NEG	2	I would have send this back but I need to do some more copying . it be a piece of junk as far as I be concern . a piece of plastic junk hope it last until I be do need it . also the door do not stay closed and once you send the record to I tune that be it it be do . just like everything else these day poorly make and way overprice .
Headphone	POS	5	the signal strength be superior , very comfortable on ear . battery long for the hour and charge station keep the headset charge every time . this be my second set . right now I can use both headset connect to one of the station . I would buy this product again in the future .
Headphone	POS	5	ok ... so here go another comparison between the Koss Portpros and the sennheiser 100 's ? I be not go to bear you . . both headphone be outstanding performer with a ipod ... I own they both ... so which one be my preference ? the sennheiser , for one reason only ... people use they ipod in mall and on the go . there be time when I want to remove the phone from my ear for a few moment -lrb- say , in a store or when have conversation -rrb- . with the Sennheisers , I can remove the phone from my ear and let they `` hang '' around my neck in comfort ... try this with the Koss 's and they will place a stranglehold on you . for this reason alone , I recommend the Senn 's . both , in my humble opinion , sound equally good .
Headphone	NEU	3	short version be that this be a nice mp3 player . expansion slot for sd , solid construction -lrb- battery cover be a bit flimsy though -rrb- battery life be long . etc. etc. . biggest drawback that negate all of the above be that they drm cripple the little thing . it be so nice up until you find out you have to use TDK 's proprietory UniFi software . which unify nothing . it `` allow '' you to copy mp3 from you system to it . and then they be dead . you can not copy they back , you can not transfer they to anything else . and here be the best part , Windows do not recognize the device unless you install the software . it be all the software as well , if you merely remove the sd card you can move and copy mp3 to it via a reader and the mojo play they fine . but obviously this do not work for the main flash memory . and you need the software to make it work ... so unless someone reverse engineer the program , do not buy this .
Headphone	POS	4	I buy this in a combo with the Razer Orcas . I be plan to clip it onto the wire of my Orcas but the clip be too big . Wish you could change that . other than that , this mic pick up everything . good or bad ? depend . as I say earlier , great for what you pay for and I do not think you would use this for record music or anything . I use it for communicate over Skype for gaming or just talk to friend .
Headphone	NEG	1	unfortunately the headphone have already stop work . one of the earbud go out completely about 1wk after receive they . the only other problem be that I be assume because of low cost price I do not feel that it be worth with to return it .
Headphone	NEG	1	these be just aweful . after about 4 mo , they will not hold onto you head . if you look down while wear they , they will hit the floor . also , if you audio signal go quiet for more than about 30 seconds , you hear a little `` click '' then deafening static hiss . be very dissapointed .
Headphone	POS	4	I have a pair of the old l-jack one that last I several year . they break , tragically , with I put they in a bag that get crush . I replace they with a pair of the straight jack style and they do not last 8 month before the right channel all but stop work . but I be go to get another pair because : they isolate sound - really - well : it could be dangerous if you be walk or etc. . the sound be good : most earbud be too treble-y but these be well-balanced they be comfortable : I do not care for cold metal bit in my ear . and the foam be more comfortable than silicone . they be cheap they be not hideous or flashy only downside be that they 'll break pretty easily if crushed and they be cheaply make -lrb- but they be cheap , so that be to be expect -rrb- .
Headphone	NEU	3	you get what you pay for . the quality of the sound seem fine , but I can not get they loud enough to really test they . I buy these for my 2 small child , so that they could listen to they dvd on car trip . they seem to like they ok , although the bud be a little big . but when I try to listen to music with they , I could barely hear .
Headphone	NEG	1	the headphone stop work after my 3rd or 4th run . I shorten the wire and use only the top half . I find that I really like the short cord and do not worry about the broken bottom half of the cord . I suffer a personal set back and be not able to exercise or use the headphone for several month . I recently start use the headphone again and after another 4 run , they be indeed break . I try they on other music player and still get nothing . I contact the seller and they say I be out of the 3 month warrenty . I be hope they could\/would be willing to fix or exchange my headphone . -lrb- not really one to spend this much money on headphone -rrb- . they do not even entertain any notion of compensation . how come the consumer can not have a policy ? my policy be a set of headphone should last longer than 10 use or 6 month . I live in a dream world I guess .
Headphone	NEU	3	I be sorry to say that the general comment about these headphone appear to be true . I be after some circum-aural , close back , reasonably price and reasonably balanced headphone and these tick all the box . the sound be great , the cable be long enough for my need , it come with a pouch to store they in when you be not wear they and they look pretty great too . the major flaw with this product be that these headphone be so tight that they soon become unbearable to wear . the band be very small and tightly spring and by the time half hour have pass and I have have these press against the side of my head I have a headache and feel slightly nauseous . not ideal condition to say the least . I wear glass and have the arm of they press against my skull be unbearable , but even when I try these with my glass off it be still too uncomfortable . I even try a few day with these stretch over a box whenever I be not wear they and whilst this help very slightly , it be never comfortable enough to wear these to enjoy my music . the packaging , as other have note be atrocious as well , it be a mission to get into these and you need a sharp knife and much care so as not to damage the headphone as you open they . I be disappoint with these , as apart from the one major flaw these be exactly what I be after and after considerable time research different type of headphone for my requirement these fall short of the mark in the comfort stake . I send mine back for a refund , but I would still suggest they be worth a try as the other feature be so good , just be aware they may be too tight for you . Feel free to check out my blog which can be find on my profile page .
Headphone	POS	4	overall , the quality of these earbud be very good . they seem very sturdy and the build quality be great . the bud themselves look rather plain to I , but the remote look pretty good . the issue of a noisy cord be something that will happen to most earbud out there , so nothing unexpected there . -lrb- use the clip help a lot . -rrb- the 45 degree angle of the plug be a nice feature and the remote work well with my ipod touch 4g . the package I get come with ear-hook that seem to work well , a nice v-moda brand pouch , and a four different size of tip that should work for most people out there . the earbud fit my rather large ear canal snugly and overall be comfortable . in term of the sound quality , these will definitely beat the quality of the basic white ipod earbud as well as most basic earbud . the bass be heavy , and boom . personally , I feel it overwhelm , but some people prefer that . -lrb- I 'll definitely be use these while listen to some dubstep though ; -rrb- . -rrb- however , -lrb- it could be the powerful bass , but -rrb- I feel as if the treble be only alright . the high just be not as clear as they could be and seem a bit muddle to I . I be compare these to the first generation of  lady Gaga Heartbeats In-Ear Headphones -lrb- Rose Red -rrb-  -lrb- the remix do beat the Heartbeats in overall bass power , but , again , I personally prefer the bass not to overwhelm too much . -rrb- to summarize , pro - great build quality and durability - remote work nicely -45 degree plug be nice - Bass be powerful con - Treble be only average
Headphone	POS	5	i love this little guy for one its hellum cheaper then at like guitar center or radio shack and it work great i can now record myself on my computer with this so im happy
Headphone	NEU	3	these sound pretty good for $ 15 dollar headphone but beware of one thing ... the power output of you device and here 's why . to make decent sound headphone at a lower cost , they must sacrifice the magnet quality . when you have a less efficient magnet , it require more power from the device to move the magnet , and thus the speaker driver . these sound ok with my creative zen and I could not seem to get the sound loud enough to drown out outside noise . then I try my studio , higher quality headphone with be 3x the size with a 50mm driver and it be significantly louder with the same device , which it could only do because of the magnet quality . I try they with a ipod , and because they have a high power output , I could get the volume I need from these , but it may be different for any non ipod device . so if you be use these with a ipod , do not fret and go for it , they sound great , especially at this price . however , beware that they may not potentially meet you need if it be not a ipod or smaller device .
Headphone	POS	5	sound quality be amazing . noise reduction be pretty good too , can not hear anything once I have these bad boy on .
Headphone	NEG	1	yay ! I get it ! I plug it in , turn it on and crystal clear I can hear my neighebor on the left hand side talk about he will with he attorney on one channel , and my neighbor on the right hand side orderede capri in khaki on the other channel . Perfect ... except I want to hear my music . I think it be in the next channel but can not tell for sure under all that static . 1 star for get my neighbor chordless phone , that may come in useful to someone sometime . the headphone be comfortable and light . battery be contain within the headphone , so you have to replace battery every so often . static be huge issue , I can barely hear what I be suppose to hear and I be stand right over the base . the base also very light , do not even feel substantial enough to transmit anything .
Headphone	POS	5	I would say that these be a great value for the price . I like a lot of bass , but there be not a overwhelming amount of bass . the treble be crisp and cymbal be not pingy , they be crisp and precise . for the price of $ 14.99 , these earphone be a incredible value . the treble be crisp , the bass be great . and consider I have a 200 watt infinity sub on my home system , I know good bass when I hear it . these earphone be comfortable and sound great . I use they everyday at school with my portable cd player , and let I say I be extremely satisfy with they . consider I purchase these to replace a pair of $ 75 Sony Earphones , and I be more satisfied with these , I be extremely impressed . the only reason I can think of why somebody would give these a bad review , be if they purchase a pair of Sennheiser pro series which run minimum $ 150 a pair . these earphone have the best quality for the money ! do not pass these up !
Headphone	POS	5	ive have these for a couple day and there sick , im very big on my music . there great for all type of music just adjust the eq level , worth every cent , i love v moda im never onna change brand .
Headphone	POS	5	headphone be great , they be comfortable and come with three different ear bud size . sound quality be also great . Bang for the buck .
Headphone	POS	5	my experience with noise reduce earphone be with the JVC hanc100 , which be a earlier , and fairly satisfactory headphone . I have be satisfy with it for about a year . this , the JVC hanc80 noise cancel headphone , be even better ! the sound rendition be superb . and this model have two mode of noise reduction : low frequency , and a wider range for more typical noisy environment , e.g. office , library , shopping , home -lrb- when relative visit -rrb- , auto travel , bus , aircraft , well , you get the picture ... I like the wide range . at home with airconditioner , fan , neigborhood sound , jet above , radio blare , dog bark etc , the effect be comforting . add some music from you ipod or radio earphone outlet and you find yourself in a -lrb- quiet -rrb- heaven , listen to a high quality of sound reproduction . I be impress with the sound quality , and I have use earphone of various type for many year . one must understand that these , or any , noise-reduction earphone be exactly that : they be not noise-cancelling ! silicone earplug be the best you can do in that regard . best noise reduction be in the very low frequency -lrb- make my Boston MBTA subway excursion bearable -rrb- . the excellent sound quality be icing on the cake . get real ! this be not star Trek , merely the 21st century . you do not need to spend $ 350 for that high price brand ! this be a excellent product . recommend . also look at the JVC harx300 non-noisecancelling phone . they go over the ear , be very reasonably price , have fantastic sound . not design to be easily transport -lrb- do not fold -rrb- . I love they - have three , in each place in my home where I like to listen to music or tv .  JVC Full-Size Headphones -lrb- Black -rrb-
Headphone	POS	5	the blue band be a nice silicone material . these be super lightweight , too ! if you have a tendency to nap with headphone , turn you head such that you ear rest on a pillow be not painful like most `` can '' , but almost unnoticeable . the 15 -25 khz response , and inline volume slider re great attribute .
Headphone	NEU	3	these headphone have be pretty good for I for a little over a year . they have give I a sore head after extended use , but nothing too severe . my main issue here come with the retractable headphone cord go bad , and just outside the one-year warranty , to boot . I have be the only one use they , and not in any way that should harm they . the left ear have begin to stop work , and I have to twist the cord around to get any sound in it at all . all in all , good headphone for a little over a year , but watch out for the headphone cord give out .
Headphone	POS	5	I have own the Bose Quietcomfort 15 and currently own the monster beat Studio , and these sound very similar to the Beats ONLY if you fiddle around with the eq . since I own a Sony walkman , it have a customize eq which be very great . I adjust to sound almost as the Beats , but the only thing that the Beats overcome with these kicker headphone be its stronger bass . not say the kicker have no bass , it have alot for $ 45 compare to $ 300 . overall , I recommend these , light on you head , comfortable , and sound be clear .
Headphone	POS	5	I be look for headphone that would stay put while I be run and after a lot of research I find these . I love they as soon as I put they in -- I have smaller ear so the various size be ideal . they absolutely stay put when I go run , no matter how much I sweat . I put they in and do not have to think about my headphone again until I take they out .
Headphone	NEU	3	pricey for the slight improvement in sound quality and the case be barely enough to provide a tiny extra bit of protection for you headphone . however , I get it for a cheap price from one of the third-party seller on amazon , and it feel comfortable in my ear as compare to the regular earphone .
Headphone	NEG	2	too uncomfortable and hard to hear if there be any outside noise . it would be better if they be smaller and would fit nice and snug inside my ear .
Headphone	POS	5	my husband have be use these at work , five day per week , for just under two year now . he love they . they work well and do not hurt you head or ear after wear they for a while .
Headphone	POS	4	overall a amazing deal . for the cost the sound quality be absolutely amazing , crisp , clear , but lack the bass you would get with more expensive and larger con headphone . the only downfall to these be the design and comfort , which at they worse be not really that bad . the headband catch on you hair all the time and be not convenient to take on and off because the adjustability be not very convenient . the other adjustability problem be the `` comfort zone '' adjuster to make the earphone tighter or looser on you head , very inconvenient . but overall you can not beat the quality for the price . if you want the best headphone for under $ 50 , you find they with these , although they have a few imperfection , the value to quality ratio be unbeatable . great value !
Headphone	POS	4	the SENNHEISER PMX SPORT be ABSOLUTLEY great for all use , indoors and out . very comfortable to wear and great sound . DO NOT HINDER in ANY WAY a activity .
Headphone	POS	4	the first thing I notice about these headphone be the comfort -- the material be very soft and fit just around my ear -lrb- though it may not work for other , as I have very small ear -rrb- . the headband , stuff with a little cotton , fit especially well over my head , and do not beat down on the top as some other plastic one have . after I put they on , I notice that I could hear EVERYTHING ... which might be good or bad , depend on its use . it be good for closed performance -lrb- without a audience -rrb- because every tiny nuance provide by the performer be present crystal-clear . in fact , at certain very , very quiet pause , I even could hear the orchestra turn the page -lrb- literally -rrb- ! however , it be not so good for live performance , where every obnoxious \* cough , cough \* or \* HACKGH , HACKGH \* from the audience can be hear , equally crystal-clear . another trait of these headphone be that , when I let other try they , the headphone do not leak . that be , I can not hear what they be listen to unless I jam my ear against theirs , and they certainly can not hear I . this `` containment '' of the sound be probably the reason why the music sound much louder through these than through the other I have try . overall , I think these headphone be worth the price . however , they do not leak as much sound as the Panasonic noise-canceling headphone , and they be especially comfortable and extremely , I repeat extremely clear .
Headphone	NEG	2	these be not very good . I do not like how they fall of my ear so easily . I have to keep push they back in and the sound quality be comprimise .
Headphone	POS	5	I reccommend they to all who want a nice pair of headphone at a great price , I own three pair of they for different member of my family . my twelve year old daughter love they . great quality and sound .
Headphone	POS	5	they sound great , ear clip actually work , one of the best pair of headphone that I have ever buy for less than $ 20
Headphone	POS	5	I have be go through several pair of open , on-ear full-size headphone but I need to get earbud that block noise and do not leak like crazy -lrb- like my open one do -rrb- anyways , I be a bit skeptical when I order these -lrb- after read comparison on head-fi forum -rrb- but I have be nothing short of impressed . here be one tip - if you get in-ear earbud make sure they come with different size earpiece . these headphone do . this be extremely important !!! if they do not , plan to buy some separately . everyone 's ear be different in size so make sure the earpiece fit right . sound = 4\/5 Bass = 4\/5 Noise cancelling = superb for this price point -lrb- mine be sixteen -rrb- you can not find something that be this sturdy and with this sound quality . they be awesome ! earbud MAY induce massive WAX ATTACKS : also , if you not use to wear in-ear earbud - be aware - because the earbud be a `` foreign object , '' you ear canal might -lrb- like mine do -rrb- produce ear wax to combat it . yuk ! I clean my ear before and after i use these guy . bottom line : get these headphone - they be affordable sturdy sound great ample bass isolate well come with different size earpiece well design - leave be shorter than the right , which wrap around behind you head also - you can lie down with they in you ear because they do not stick out like other do
Headphone	POS	4	we get these for several multi-user workstation . they be adequate for the price . we want something with plastic\/leather ear pad that can be wipe down between user , and these provide that for we . these be best for industrial , public , multi-user situation where the listener will not be need they for very long . as other have mention , they be not very comfortable , so you do not want to wear they for more than 30 minute at time -lrb- or less , for those who have large head -rrb- . the sound be also adequate for the above state purpose . these be by no means mean to be use to pick out the 3rd chair violin during a very quiet movement of Bach .
Headphone	POS	5	Great for the money . they sound decent for non ear bud phone on a mp3 player but backgrond sound be not as efficintly block . but if you like I and can not use ear bud this be a great alternative
Headphone	POS	5	this product be another great buy for I and for a cheap price that I have save a x amount of dollar .
Headphone	POS	5	I enjoy listen to hi-fi audio through headphone . my setup be laptop use JetAudio -- -rrb- Predator DAC\/AMP -- -rrb- d5000 . the can be great ! superb detail and honest to music reproduction w that wow factor . Bass seem heavy but I like it . I be burn they in now . I own d2000 and audio-technica 990-ti 's and each have they home but I listen mostly to the d5000 's now .
Headphone	POS	5	awesome product , I have use bose , Sony and Pioneer and the sein be way better , and for the money be awesome and conformable . my wife put aside she bose and now I have to buy she a set . I listen to rock and they handle the bass very very well , even with hip hop and techno and the bass bounce back fast , I do not know the term for it , but it handle fast bass throw at it like from Meatallica and such ... so if you like rock or metal , these be good to go ... even for classical and club , I try all music so far . well not polka or swing , but I be sure it 'll work ... Hope this help , , shoot shoooot .
Headphone	POS	5	love these headphone . they last a very long time as compare with other headphone I have use . they be very comfortable and stay put even during very jarring activity such as run . they be also water\/sweat resistant . I have fry out many other headphone because of this and these be the only one that stay in my smallish ear without constant fiddling . Worth pay a little more for , but they be on the higher side for headphone . price have come down a bit due to a newer version out .
Headphone	NEG	1	Techinically sprake the sound quality of this headphone be good , but my headphone do not work after few day normal usage
Headphone	NEG	2	I can not say enough bad thing about these if you be go to use they for run . they be make to go on you arm , so one cord be longer than the other . they have a connector half way down that come with a extender enable they to be longer and attach to to you waist , but this make the cord heavy thus pull they out of you ear . because the cord be rubber they also bounce a lot when run . I give they two star since they do come with multiple size piece that fit nicely into you ear . if you be go to sit still when use they they be great . if you be plan on use they actively keep look .
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be wonderful . they be the best pair of headphone I have ever own . I consider myself a audiophile . I have no electronic background but have purchase many high-end piece of audio equipment over the past 30 year . I currently own several headphone include the ah-d2000 -lrb- I purchase these for my daughter -rrb- and the Ultimate Ears triple . fi10 earbud to use when I travel . I be sure I would love the ah-d7000 but I feel the $ 600 difference be probably not justifiable . I be able to purchase these for $ 399 . there be a small , but noticeable , sound quality difference between the 2000 and 5000 headphone that I feel the less than $ 200 difference between they be worth it . Bass be deeper without distortion . Treble note be crisper . midrange be fuller . although I can listen to classical music , my preference be classic rock . Pink Floyd dark side of the Moon and The Wall sound fantastic . Led Zeppelin be amazing . for those that have comment that these headphone need a external amp to drive they , I disagree . although the majority of the time I listen to they use my Pioneer Elite receiver and they sound great , I plug they into my ipod and they sound very good . the quality of the music be not as full , rich , and `` powerful '' sound but more than I expect , especially give the review I read . I do not know if I would opt for the 5000 over the 2000 if the price differential be over $ 300 -lrb- I have see they from $ 399 to $ 699 -rrb- ; but , I feel it be a bargain at the $ 140 difference when I buy they .
Headphone	NEU	3	well ... I get the item and it be NEW . on here I think it be state that the charger and what not be not include . BUT IT WAS !!! it be NEW in the box with everything and factory seal . well ... I have only listen to they a couple of time so far . they sound good and work good ! I will admit that and do not get I wrong . and I have even use they with my Iphone dock to my Sony stereo , which by the way be another half useless item , that I have beef with other than docking my phone and listen to Slacker stereo on it from my subscription . the headphone work through the wall and onto outside with the door close . I have even go to my car with they on and it be not right outside my front door . after a certain point , it be intermittent sound , but that be expect - look how far I go ! I be not expect ANY SOUND where I go . but I get some , and as I come back and get closer again to my apartment , it come in clear as a whistle ! but hey ! I be in a apartment complex . but these be the reason I be give this 3 star instead of 4 or 5 though . they be really bulky to wear . and when I see they on the website , I look at the ear cushion . I think they be some type of leather , or a rubber type of material like other company 's headwear . the description do not talk about the cushion . well ... when I see what the ear cushion be when I open the box , I be kind of mad for that kind of money , that they would put this soft material like ear cushion . and it also specifically state in the instruction that you should change these cushion OFTEN . that mean you gotta come out of you pocket over and over to keep on BUYING ear cushion for this thing , like you be rich or something . and I be sure it aint CHEAP either , cos these AINT CHEAP HEADSETS ! that be if you can find they somewhere . I have not look yet though . but I clearly be not happy about that at all and I sincerely think about send they back at first . but I keep they , because it be a good buy , compare to other place that sell they . I look before I buy them ... and after I buy them . that be the ONLY REASON why I keep THESE HEADSETS , because I see what the actual price be go for and it be WAY more than what I pay on Amazon at the time . and I do mean WAY more !!!! but for now , they be just sit there collect dust . so ... whenever when !
Headphone	POS	5	the headset be buy for my slightly deaf father . he live in a nursing home and have a roommate . I choose the rs-140 because it have the `` closed can '' to shut out the -lrb- also hear impaired -rrb- roommate 's tv etc while allow my father to hear he tv . the setup work great . the separate volume for each earphone allow perfect balance to compensate for differential hearing ability in each ear . if you want to be able to hear the room as well as the music go with the rs-130 to get the `` open can '' . I use the headset during the setup and find no fault with the sound quality or reproduction and there do not appear to be any interferance from other electronic device . he sometimes wear the headset `` down the hall '' and the quality do not begin to degrade -lrb- through concrete block wall in a steel frame building full of medical equipment -rrb- for about 80 foot -- in open air I be sure it would be double that . the headset be comfortable and the charge arrangement be transparent to the user . my father find the charge stand `` a little tippy '' because he have to reach the headset with a grabber from a wheelchair across a bed . mount the charge base fix that . a person use they hand would not have this problem at all .
Headphone	POS	4	I buy these headphone as a gift for my mother so she could listen to the tv with out turn up the volume at night . they fit a little snug on my head but I think they be wear in a little so it be not too bad . if you have a smaller head they fit just fine like my mother . they do not have ear cup like regular headphone but they do sit on top of you ear and conform somewhat . it just take a little while to get use to the feeling . they feel like they will fall off at time but they be snug . the sound be pretty good for FM reception . you can walk like 50 to 100 foot away and still pick up the signal indoors . the box say 300 foot outdoors but I do not try it . I be sure they go close to it . the headphone have a tuning button on they to tune into the channel you want . all so the transmitter have 3 channel setting so you can find one that work best for you . it be not hard to tune in just keep turn the knob till you get a good signal on the headphone . sometimes you can pickup up CB radio and phone call if they be close by but only if you un tune the headphone from the transmitter till you hear static . it be kind of funny to hear people talk on the phone and the cb but it be only when you un tune the headphone otherwise it be not a problem at all . the sound be clear . put the headphone on the charger be easy too they just slide right into place and line up with the metal bar in the headphone . you may have to shorten the headphone when you put they back on the charger because the instruction say not to hold open the headphone or put they on a glass dummy head because they can lose there snug fit over time . it be not a problem if you remember to do this . you can also hang the charger on the wall . it have a hole in back for a nail or some other hook to hang it up with . the cord for the power and sound connector be long too about 5 to six foot more or less so you should have no problem place the transmitter anywhere to get better reception . it can hook up to a radio with the include adapter or hook up to a mp3 player or what ever take that kind of plug . the charger cradle be sturdy and have rubber foot on it so it do not tip over or move when you place the headphone back on to charge . the box they come in be easy to open and be well pack with 2 set of air bag . over all I like they and recommend they to any one .
Headphone	POS	5	this headphone be great , this be my first headphone and be great , good sound quality , perfect noise reduction , the only bad thing be that they will get a little hot on you ear but after use it for 2 straight hour ... so I guess this be a must if you want good headphone .
Headphone	POS	4	these be just excellent for the price . Bass : not too much bass or not to little bass , Bass be deep and rich . seem to be very balanced , never Muddy at all very strong @ 100 + hz . lose some bass strength under 40hz . if you a bass head just plug in you Headphone Amp and use a eq and trust I , the bass will vibrate you ear with these headphone and they still sound fairly clean but can be muddy . stock without any equalization the bass be balanced and fine . high : high sometimes get distorted or sound too harsh -lrb- Pretty Rare but be noticeable on some song -rrb- . you can hear little crackling sound and it just make I wa not to take they off or change the song , otherwise high be just fine Mids : balanced and lot of definition , just like the bass , not to little or too much . Comfort\/Built Quality : after wear they for a while you will get use to they and they will seem lighter and you can wear they for a longer amount of time without they hurt you ear . I can listen to these for about 2 hour straight before i have to take they off because my ear hurt . pad be comfortable and the stuffing be nice and soft . build Quality be ok , some part of the headphone feel really cheap like the plastic thingie that allow the headphone to turn . all the other material on the headphone feel pretty high end .
Headphone	POS	4	I first try a pair of Shure E1C earbud and hate they ; I think they make everything sound tinny . then I try the Sony and think exactly the same thing , and could not figure out why I get better sound out of the $ 10 pair of earbud I buy at the Sony Outlet . after a couple of subway and airplane ride , I finally figure out the whole thing : - fit be everything with deep-insertion ear instrument . earbud , hear protection , whatever . fit be everything . once I finally get they seat correctly , they isolate outside noise very well and sound clear , keep in mind that I be not expect the same visceral reaction to earbud that I have to my over-the-ear akg phone . - use CD quality source material for you first listen . I think it be the bud -lrb- both Shure and Sony -rrb- that be make my source sound tinny , and then I rip a cd of 128k mp3 and decide that I hate what the compression do to the music . I simply fail to pay attention before I start use a portable device . not to plug , but WMA format cure a lot of the compression problem to I . -lrb- Apple format also sound good on my friend 's ipod . -rrb- - would have like a inline volume control . I know that eat into fidelity , but whatever ; make a control with gold plate contact already . - the whole cord extension thing be a disaster . too short with , too long without . do not even get I start on the `` case . '' mostly , I like these earbud ; Sony certainly have other `` high resolution '' earbud but if you can get these around $ 30 , it be a decent choice .
Headphone	POS	5	product be Great . Service be great . keep up the good work !
Headphone	POS	5	before purchase this product , I have be read about people recommend the Sennheiser hd555 's and whatnot and it concern I if the ad700 's be really the better deal . what I really want be a set of headphone that could be use for gaming and watch movies\/listening to music in general . as soon as the headphone arrive I be blow away by the soundstage that it carry . I play game such as cs 1.6 and previously with my old headphone I could hear the general location of where thing be , and with these new headphone I could hear the precise location of where every grenade land , to the extent that it shock I . as I be grind the headphone in for the first few hour the sound quality seem a little weak at first , but as soon as a week or two pass by the sound become amazing . I enjoy these headphone so much that even as I be wear they I feel like I be listen to my surround sound speaker . a thing to note that it be hard to adjust to the switch of use headphone mainly compare to speaker -lrb- as I do not realize how loud the headphone actually be since I forget that I be use headphone and not the speaker , mean the loud sound you get at that close range might be dangerous -rrb- . all in all , the headphone be fantastic and worth the money , as I doubt I will be need any new replacement in the future . oh and , the appearance of the headphone in person do not look as cheap as it seem on the picture you see ; actually , they seem like high-class headphone , a luxurious set of headphone make with lovely material that make you feel like a king .
Headphone	POS	5	I have never leave a review before but could not resist let every one know what a great product these little bud be . I buy these bud after the original bud to my ipod finally break . what a great investment !! I just get back from a trip to Costa Rica and these thing be simply amazing on the airplane . I never use my ipod on the plane before because I could never hear without turn the volume up all the way and I still could not hear all that well . I admit I have to turn up the volume a tad with these bud , but not that much . -lrb- you do have to push the tip into you ear to drown out the surround sound . -rrb- every time my husband want to talk to I he have to tap I on the shoulder . these be also great if you have small ear canal . the extra small tip be wonderful and they do not keep fall out of my ear like the Ipod bud do . I also find they very comfortable when I wear they at night in bed when my insomnia kick in . at first I think the sound quality be not all that great , even after `` break in , '' but the more I have use these puppy the more the sound quality have improve . finally , I love the cord ! it do not tangle and seem to be very well make even though it be thin . over all , great product and worth every penny . I buy the blue one and may even buy the pink one to `` color coordinate ! ''
Headphone	NEU	3	maybe I have a peculiar shaped ear , but it seem these earbud can fall out quite easily . I have try all the different silicone size and it still do not fix the issue . especially when I be eat , the chew movement displace the earbud very quickly . another note , and this maybe be true of all in-ear earbud , be any movement to the wire will be translate to noise in you ear . I can hear all the rustle as I move around . other than these issue , sound quality be good compare to my stock ipod one .
Headphone	POS	5	these be great - money well spend ! they sound great , fit well and be very light and comfortable . it be exactly what I be look for in a set of headphone that I could use at the gym . and all at a great price from Amazon . thanks !
Headphone	POS	4	this be the consumer version of Sony 's professional mdr-7506 phone , widely use in the film and broadcast industry , which be standard issue at the radio station where I work . due to the shallow ear cup , I find they uncomfortable after about two hour . but they be rugged , compact when fold , and the coil cord be top . however , I have never be content with they sound . the high end be exaggerate . this can be useful for location recording , as it accentuate hiss and other unwanted noise . however , I can not recommend mix with these because it be hard not to overcompensate for they inherent brightness , and the strong high frequency quickly induce listen fatigue . these phone have be in production for two decade , but I prefer they little brother , the discontinue 7504 model , which have a more balanced sound . that say , I have not yet find a good , affordable alternative to the mdr-7506 -lrb- a.k.a mdr-v6 -rrb- . as other have note , the only difference between the v6 and 7506 be a gold-plated plug adapter , the length of the warranty , and whether the sticker on the ear cup be marked `` Professional '' or not .
Headphone	NEG	1	the earbud be useless ! they didnt even work . the poorly make product be obviously a reason for it be so cheap . waste my money and time
