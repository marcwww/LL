CableModem	POS	5	I buy this to replace the lease modem -lrb- also DOCSIS 3.0 -rrb- from Charter . it provide equivalent performance , and you will save $ $ $ every month . no technical skill be require to install . write on paper the MAC address from the label on the back of the new modem . disconnect the old Charter modem and attach the coaxial internet cable to the new modem and plug modem into a electrical outlet -lrb- consider use a surge protector -rrb- . call Charter support to activate the new modem . the service technician will need the MAC address that you write on the paper . the whole process will take about 10 minute . Performance be great . I have have no problem with the modem . the speed usually exceed my 30\/3 service .
CableModem	POS	5	receive the unit fast and come in great condition . no issue and be easy to setup . keep in mind you will need to call Comcast after connect the unit and give they the MAC address to connect it on they side .
CableModem	POS	4	I wish I have buy this modem year ago instead of pay Comcast more than $ 800 for a rental during that time . -lrb- ... -rrb-
CableModem	POS	4	the product arrive intact . setup be easy . just need to plug in the cable , call Comcast , and the whole thing start to work . I have be use the modem for 2 month . so far , there have not be any problem . the price at $ 140 be certainly a bit steep . I have not do any deep technical datum gathering yet . simple internet speed test indicate the modem can certainly support the specific speed I order via Comcast . the only drawback be Motorola do not offer any warranty on the device . so beware about this fact before make you purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	the cable modem be extremely easy to set up . have the thing ready to go in 1\/2 hr . that include the call to comcast to register the product . very happy with the purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	even with a decent surge protector , my separate Netgear modem and Belkin router -lrb- both recent purchase -rrb- would need reboot after even brief power blip . and the wifi signal be weak . I be tell a combo unit would help , so go for this all-in-one unit . right out of the box , have no problem hook up and put in the wifus password . no need to use install disc . BUT , do have problem with Charter Comm 's try to complete the install . multiple try with they online `` modem replacement '' program be futile , and it take several try to get through on the phone . when I finally get a human on the line , all he need be the new Mac number and the rest of the install go quickly . strength of wifus and speed greatly improve over last system . now just wait on power blip to see what happen .
CableModem	POS	5	it be simple to connect and take only minute . have be use it for the past month and have absolutely no complaint . by purchase this modem , instead of rent the cable commpany , it will save I money . the longer I use it the more I save . there have be no problem with the connection whatsoever . I highly recommend this modem .
CableModem	POS	5	Works great . come with zero instruction or manual book , so I be confuse for a minute before realize that all you need to do be plug it for it to work . fast !
CableModem	POS	5	work great . this replace a old scientific atlanta modem from cox and my download increase by more than 5x 's -lrb- upload stay about the same -rrb- .
CableModem	POS	4	I have have this install on Comcast -lrb- North NJ -rrb- for the last week . so far it be work fantastic , operate well above what I would have expect to get off Comcast 's network . that be say it do appear to be somewhat sensitive to signal issue . I have to have a Comcast tech come out and help trace out a wire because the modem would go squirrely around 9:30 or 10 every night and then start work in the morning . we located and remove 2 splitter which have clean up the signal strength issue -lrb- it be run at the top of the spec would strength for outgoing and incoming message -rrb- . hopefully thing continue go well !
CableModem	POS	5	this be my first docsis3 wireless cable modem and have it install by the Comcast serviceman . I have earlier set up the router off line for wire and wireless functionality . the direction be easy to follow for set security and the various network . I like the ability to have a private network and a guest access point . speed test show over 30 mb download and 5 mb upload , however this change from day to day . the installer have never see over 3 mb upload speed . I have no issue with strength of signal . Modem be on a ground level floor and signal easily reach the second floor . other have comment on the heat this modem generate , I have the same experience , it simply run hot . there be a power adjustment that seem to allow the unit to run on 25 % , 50 % , 75 % and 100 % power setting . I will try the 75 % set to see if it run cooler without any loss in wireless signal or speed . I have a older docsis2 surfboard run on Wideopenwest service for a couple of year now with no issue . much more stable than my older two unit system have a separate modem and wireless router . my it friend recommend seperate unit , but I have have a good experience with the combined modem . give the cost comparison , this one win .
CableModem	NEG	1	absolutely terrible ! do not reach all area of we house -lrb- and its not a big house -rrb- and cant . handle multiple device . im disappointed and we be go to bee look for something better !
CableModem	POS	4	out of nowhere , I be have excruciatingly slow internet speed on Comcast . the Comcast tech advise that my Motorola sb 4100 be at the `` end of life '' and that I should upgrade . skeptical , I purchase this modem which be a DOCSIS 3.0 -lrb- and backwards compatible -rrb- modem . it work . I go from a 2mbp download speed to over 17mbp . what a difference . there be one installation glitch that you need to be aware of . when you hook up the modem -lrb- connect the coax cable , connect the ethernet cable , and plug it in , that be it -rrb- , and then try to get online , it will direct you to a Comcast self-activation screen -lrb- no other site be available -rrb- . after enter my account number and phone number and hit the `` next '' button , I get a blank screen , and nothing happen . so I call Comcast and they say that usually happen if you be do a upgrade ; it mostly work only for a new service connection . however , it be a simple matter to give the tech you MAC address and the serial number . after about 5 minute , while he stay on the line , it come alive , no problem . BUT , here be the thing : the serial number they need be the customer serial number . this be only find on the bottom of the Motorola box the modem come in . this be different from the `` s\/n '' serial number that be on the label that be on the instruction sheet and on the bottom of the modem itself . the customer s\/n have letter in it ; the regular S\/N have only number in it and be too long . my first Comcast tech do not know that and it take a day to sort it out . other than that , it work well with my iMac and Apple Airport Extreme Base wireless router . enjoy
CableModem	POS	5	we own a big house that be now a Bed and Breakfast . there be eight television and a lot of cable go to they ! the long cable to multiple television make for weak signal strength reception . the Motorola Signal Booster be now provide great digital quality to every part of the house ! I be more than please with the booster !
CableModem	NEG	1	do not waste you money . all cable company provide these item for free plus free installation . for those who insist on own one , beware : the modem do not last long . at most 2-3 year and than burn out . happen to I 3 time , the first last a few month , the second 2 year , the last almost a year , when it finally dawn on I : call Com ... they come , install , hi-fi have everything . beautiful !! no more worry .
CableModem	POS	4	Compact , small , lightweight , this modem function well . setup be easy -lrb- I do have to contact my internet provider -rrb- . my only quibble be that it lack a power shutoff button , so I leave it on all the time -lrb- be I to be go a extended time period , I would disconnect power -rrb- .
CableModem	POS	5	the review for the CISCO cm100 answer all of the question that I have before this item be purchase . price , the necessary step to activate , and the satisfaction each of the buyer have with the unit .
CableModem	POS	5	arrive quickly . Works great . just plug in and call Comcast . give they the number off the box and it work great . save I 5 buck a month .
CableModem	NEG	1	this modem work for a couple of week . and now it be not . I be not sure what be wrong with it , but it be definitely defective .
CableModem	POS	5	before ... erratic reception since area go digital . after ... no more freezing , pixeled pic , absent channel , etc. . solve what cable company could not . brilliant . Easy to install .
CableModem	POS	5	Super little gadget . beat have to rent one ! not a peep out of it . the cable installer be not sure if he could use it but call and all be well . so far , so good . I get it install in April and it be now August . not a single issue . I forget it be there , which be how it should be .
CableModem	POS	5	because they can not make enough profit off I , TW Cable start charge I $ 5 for rental of a modem they have give I for free for 6 year . it be a slight upgrade from the one I replace , although you can not really tell it from the performance . I plug it in , call TW to let they know -lrb- they have to do something in they office to get it recognize by the network -rrb- and I go right back to work on my computer .
CableModem	POS	5	my puppy decide to chew on my original charger for my broadband . this charger be a after market but it do it job without it i wouldnt be able to write this review because my internet still be down . very fast delivery although a bit high for a s & h for a wall charger
CableModem	POS	5	I have no complain at all with the modem . it do it be job and have not give I any trouble in the few month I have be use it .
CableModem	POS	5	I have Comcast Xfinity Performance , rate at 20 mb\/sec down , and 4mb\/sec up . this modem replace a lease rca dcm315r . speed test with the dcm315r be 15\/4 . the 6121 perform better with download speed of 25 mb\/sec , upload do not change .
CableModem	POS	5	I replace a older modem with this one . after Comcast set they program for it , there be no problem . I would recommend it and would buy it again .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem work well . achieve 56 mbp downstream with Comcast blast internet access service . connect reliably . be easy to configure : simply take it out of the box , connect cable and power lead , then let Comcast add the modem to its database so it allow it to connect . some review indicate the box can get hot , we have not see that .
CableModem	POS	4	use this modem with Comcast . I do not even have to call they to activate it . I just use the self-activation website and be up and run in less than 5 minute . I get this to replace a sb6121 because I want 8 downstream channel , plus the sb6121 run too hot and I have to have a fan blow on it . I be on the blast 25\/4 tier and with the sb6121 I be get 36.5 mbp down and 6.5 mbp up with Power Boost . with the dpc3008 I be get 36.1 down and 5.6 up with Power Boost . Kind of disappointing . like with the dpc3000 and dpc3010 , the dpc3008 's diagnostic screen be gimp to only show you the signal level . no channel frequency , no uptime , and no log . if Motorola can show all this information in a read-only format , why can not cisco ? another disappointment . as long as the modem work it be not that big of a deal , but detailed diagnostic information can be very helpful if you really need it . temperature wise the dpc3008 run cooler than the sb6121 and do not need a fan blow on it , so I 'll stick with it for now .
CableModem	POS	4	I have a high end workstation that I use for cad work . it have two gigabit ethernet port . I be never able to get team to work with the adapter and lately I have to turn off ipv6 and change some other setting in order to keep from drop my connection . other computer on my network be also experience slow connection . after do some research here and elsewhere I decide to try the Motorola Surfboard sb6121 since I be run and old sb5101 . initially I just run the ethernet cable directly into a laptop from the modem . when I power it on I keep get the modem reset that people be talk about . so I try connect to the modem by typing 192.168.100.1 into my browser . at first I could not connect then I finally do and be able to look in the log on the cable modem to see what be go on . the log show it continually reboot because of a t4 timeout . so I call Comcast and within a half a hour I be up and run . once I get my router hook back up I have to restart my computer a couple of time due to some IP address conflict . since then it have be work flawlessly . I be even able to enable team my network adapter ! I check my speed on speetest.net before and after the modem . my download speed do not change much but my upload speed double ! so far I be very happy !
CableModem	POS	5	we replace we old cable modem follow advice from Comcast and be not disappoint . we increase we download speed by 25 % and upload by 250 % . no problem with Comcast service rep for authorization for we Preformance service .
CableModem	NEG	1	this product be a steal item . I have to return . I have to pay 10 % for nothing . no worth to buy . I highly recommend do not buy .
CableModem	POS	5	I install my new Motorola SB6121 Cable Modem today . the cable connection and bootup of the modem complete without a hitch and I contact Xfinity Cable -lrb- Comcast -rrb- and speak with a internet specialist who take my HFC MAC ID number and my customer serial number off the box . after reboot the modem and router -lrb- wrt54gl -rrb- , I bring up the computer . at first I could not connect to the internet , but after I change my lan address it come up okay . the reason it do not come up right away be that the cable guy reset my router and the setting be all set back to the default . fortunately I have save my router setting prior to contact xfinity and when I restore they back to the setting I have , everything work perfectly . so be sure if you be use a router that you save you favorite setting before you do this modem change . it can be a real pain try to remember all the setting in the router that you may have change over the year . by the way , I never connect to the computer first . Modem , Router and Computer be all connected initially but be boot in that order . so far everything now be work fine and I hope that continue . a bit too early to say how this will work out over time , but at least it be save I $ 7 a month for the time be . by the way , the Xfinity guy be great , polite and very knowledgeable . good luck . UPDATE : it be be about a month since I write the above review and since that time the modem have work flawlessly . I know some folk say there be have run very warm , but I do not find that to be true . my modem be only slightly warm to the touch , but a whole lot cooler than a lot of my other electronic device . as far as I be concerned , this be a excellent modem and be work well with my xfinity -lrb- Comcast -rrb- account . download speed 20mb and upload speed 4mb . ca not beat that in my book . sure beat the lousy dsl service I previously have .  Motorola SB6121 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem
CableModem	POS	5	to establish some background , I have cox hsus and have be use this modem for about a week . I buy this modem to replace a trusty 6 year old Scientific Atlanta DOCSIS 2.0 modem that bite the dust . I really like how the sb6121 keep my speed constant day and night . the 4x4 channel bonding help alleviate the peak time slow downs associate with a busy\/overcrowded node . on the flip side , channel bonding also help you isp enforce the cap on you subscribe internet speed . on my old modem , I would often see 30 Mbps down -lrb- my advertised speed w\/powerboost be 20 mbp -rrb- . speed test indicate my speed be now lock at 20-20 .5 mbp throughout the day . yet interestingly , I be get 15 mbp up ; -lrb- more than quadruple the speed advertise for my connection tier -rrb- ! I guess cox be not enforce upstream speed cap that well at the moment . I love how Motorola let user access the full modem signal and log at 192.168.100.1 . activate the unit be a breeze - simply call cox and read they the modem MAC ID and customer s\/n from the bottom of the box the modem come in . I will post a update review after I have play with and test the modem for a few month .
CableModem	NEG	1	this be a update after own the modem for just over 30 day : originally give 4 Stars , I have reduce the rating to 1 star . the modem die after a month of use . that leave I stick without service for several day until the weekend could pass and the cable company technician check what the problem be with my Internet Service . after a great deal of checking and cross checking , a new Motorola modem be put in by my cable guy . they sell it for $ 75 -lrb- as oppose to Amazon 's $ 50 -rrb- but offer 1 year on-site warranty with immediate replacement and installation of a problem unit - not so bad a deal if you really need to be online for certain . the new Motorola Surfboard sb5101 be instantly recognize by my Linksys router - so the problem describe below with instalation of the Linksys cable modem wre not encounter . it strike I as odd that there would be less compatability between a Linksys router and modem than between a Linksys router and Motorola modem . I get a LinkSys modem because of the good review , but also because I think it would `` play nice '' with my LinkSys router . my router be the WRT610N dual n-band so it be pretty good . when I get the modem I plug it in and give the MAC Address to my cable company . however , I could not get on the itnernet ; my cable company supply modem have work fine - I just get tire of pay the rental . they have I direct connect the modem to the computer - no problem . the problem be with the router ! the modem and router do not play nice together at all ! since my router be just over a year old , my call to LinkSys let I know they could tell I how to configure the router to get it work ... but it would cost $ 29 . to do so . they product do not work so well together , so they charge to make they work ! I refuse to pay . I get out my LinkSys Router CD , look up my router login and password and other info , then re-install the router . the reinstallation process fix it up so it get on the internet . if you get this modem and have a router , be prepare for a little hassle get it go . first impression of the modem after get it operational with the router be that it seem to provide faster internet access than the old modem from the calbe company do - though only marginally so , but still enopugh to notice . this seem to be a excellent modem and work really well . but , if you have a LinkSys wrt610n -lrb- and probably any other LinkSys router -rrb- be prepare for a little extra work to get the modem go .
CableModem	POS	4	I just love this super fast modem . its be a few month now since I get it and its totally dependable and super fast . its be work day and night with no problem since I receive it ... super fast with high response .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this before Comcast install my new service , but I could not get it to work at the time of my self-activation . I put it aside for a few week and come back to it . after have Comcast 's " Ubee " brand for a few week , which cap at 44mbp -lrb- we be suppose to have a 50mb line -rrb- , I decide to try one night to just plug in the Motorola to see what would happen . it take a while , maybe 20 minute and 5 reset , before the modem finally download the firmware it be suppose to which allow the Comcast " self-activation " screen to appear . after this point it be smooth sailing , though it take 30 more minute for the Comcast activation to work . the best part ? Speedtest now run at a solid 54.78 mbp ! I have run speedtest probably 20 time over the last week and it have never move off that number . that be get my money 's worth and also not pay Comcast for a slower modem .
CableModem	NEG	1	buy this before read the review , and it turn out to be total junk . my cable company , whose name be prominently display on this thing 's box , spend 2 hour on the phone with I and we could not get this thing to work at all , so come back here to Amazon and go with a surfboard - which work perfectly out of the box , take the cable company two minute to activate and do . do not waste you time with this turkey . too bad there be not zero star .
CableModem	POS	4	the modem be serve it be purpose . I feel that we receive a quality product and the price be reasonable . a friend of mine be the one who find this modem base on it ' review and rating .
CableModem	POS	5	excellent product at a great value . delivery be quick . setup be easy . work great so far . also purchase in conjunction with Belkin router and they be a great combo .
CableModem	POS	5	after be sick of Comcast raise they fee , I finally buy my own modem . I have only have it about 2 week now , but it have be great . my speed be pretty much the same as the rental modem be and that a good thing . if you be think about buy a modem , go with the cm100 . for the price and performance , it can not be beat .
CableModem	POS	5	this be the same modem I receive from Comcast two year ago , back then I be charge $ 2.00 a month for the modem , then 8 month later $ 5.00 , and now $ 7.00 . when this modem arrive -lrb- onetime -rrb- , I turn off the computer , disconnect it from the wireless router , connect the coax cable to new modem , connect the computer directly to modem . turn on modem , then computer . load the browser , Comcast 's `` self installation '' screen load , -lrb- have you bill handy -rrb- enter my account # , four click later , it be up and run no issue .
CableModem	POS	5	double my internet speed . Easy set up but you do need to call you cable provider and activate the unit . im with comcast , give they the serial number off the side of the modem and be on line in seconds . very well make product .
CableModem	POS	5	I use it to replace a lease comcast motorolum 5121 . the 5121 be give I 10mbps down\/0 .10 mbp up . after switch to the sb6121 , I now get 20 mbp down and 6 mbp up , which be the speed tier I be pay for + I do not have to pay comcast modem lease fee anymore . the speed measurement be do multiple time use speedtest.net . the installation be easy , have to get on the phone with a comcast tech to get the new modem enable , after that the modem work fine . UPDATE Sep 14 , 2012 . it be be a year since I have be use this . it be still go strong and work fine . I have add a manual timer to it so that the modem be reboot every weekend .
CableModem	POS	4	I buy this cable modem to get rid of the $ 5 , soon to be $ 7 , rental modem from Charter . I think I be purchase a new modem , but when the box arrive I see the refurbish labeling on the box ! I install it very quickly and it perform like new . I hope it last as long as the dsl modem that I have when I use AT&T; for Internet access !!!! I have all the download\/upload speed I could ask for with this modem ! I know Amazon will back it even though it be a refurbish unit !!!
CableModem	POS	5	Works as advertise ! a must have if you main cable line be over 50 ' , you have mutiple splitter , or live in a appartment .
CableModem	POS	5	I be use the sb6121 cable modem with Comcast cable . setup be fast and easy . plug in the box in place of the old one , and call Comcast . the service representative know what he be do . it take about 20 min from when I call to everything work properly -lrb- include hold time -rrb- . Make sure to have the MAC address handy when you call . for this packaging , the MAC be on the sticker on the bottom of the unit , as well as inside the cardboard packaging on the sticker on a paper strip . the indicator on the box be great . the receive and transmit indicator be bright blue if it detect a docsis 3.0 connection , green if it detect a docsis 2.0 connection . these receive , transmit , and online indicator be steady if connect properly . very easy to know the status at a glance from across the room . a note : on initial powerup -lrb- before call Comcast -rrb- , the receive \/ transmit light settle on green , and that have I wonder what be go on . it turn out that Comcast have to get the correct profile download on the box , and the right configuration setup at they end before the indicator be meaningful .
CableModem	POS	5	I have have this modem for about a month now . it work flawlessly . in fact it increase my speed from roughly 20mb\/s to 40mb\/s over cox . its a nice compact unit , and have a couple keyhole for wall\/shelf mount .
CableModem	POS	5	Great little unit . reliable . cheap and all yours -lrb- no `` leasing '' the thing from you cable company ! -rrb- . I have use this in three install and they just work . they be great value for money if you get a refurb and very reliable in my experience . not much more I can say really . if you be look for a cable modem , this be it .
CableModem	POS	5	order this modem as it be on Comcast 's approve list with 3 star and have receive good rating and review on other site . it replace we modem that be past useful age and keep drop the connection . very easy to setup . install it , call Comcast , give they the MAC number and that be it . no more disconnect and it seem to have add some speed to we connection . would suggest that it be install where there be plenty of air circulation . tend to run a little warm . Vendor ship the product promptly . pleased with my purchase decision .
CableModem	POS	5	Cable modem be not something for you to take care of in daily life . a good modem should be install and forget . it be the reason why I do not upgrade my modem from docsis-1 to docsis-2 until 2009 . I do not do it until I realize my internet speed be much slower than what Comcast promise then . that upgrade raise the average download throughput from 5 to 15mbp . I have be use the same internet service for more than one decade . the cable company promise 1.5 mbp at very begin . with the same monthly rate they push up they promise speed gradually . the speed be raise to 20mbp recently . but you can not enjoy the speed boost if you keep use you old hardware . my 3-year old Motorola sb5101 be also a good install and forget modem . but the connection speed can become very slow in evening , the rush hour of residential internet . docsis-3 provide the channel bonding feature which be better in retain bandwidth even in rush hour . you must contact the cable company to activate you new cable modem before use it . it be not a big deal for I because I do it twice in past decade , but I can not recall all the detail . the first Comcast specialist try to activate my sb6121 many time w\/o luck so that he transfer my call to a 2nd tier specialist . he ask I to power-cycle my modem -lrb- shut down then turn on again -rrb- , then it work flawlessly . yes , power-cycle be a necessary step in activation . the first specialist forget it and waste I almost one hour . my download speed be quite stable -lrb- 16 ~ 21mbp -rrb- now , even in evening . the throughput be only slightly faster but much more consistent than before . it work as promise . Internet technology keep evolve so that you can not always install and forget it . update -- I replace my old Linksys router with e3200 one month later . now the download speed be always fix at 25mbp , 24\/7 . look like 25mbp be the speed cap set by Comcast . the sb6121 + e3200 combo should be able to run even faster if I be willing to pay higher monthly rate . once again you need up-to-date gear in order to get full bandwidth from the internet connection you pay for .
CableModem	POS	5	I replace my old Motorola modem with the sb6121 and double my download and upload speed . it be a great value and easy to setup with Comcast .
CableModem	POS	4	Linksys CM100 , be a good product and installation be pretty simple and straight forward and have be perform to satisfaction .
CableModem	POS	4	I purchase the Motorola SB6121 SURFboard DOCSIS 30 Cable Modem in December 2011 . it be deliver promptly and be reasonably package . it appear that all of the equipment be present . the installation be reasonably easy and connected to all of my device without problem . seem to be a speedy little unit to surf the web and have not have any problem to speak of yet .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this modem to replace my DOCSIS 2 Motorola Modem and be really impress by how well this modem work . I have Mediacom and this modem instantly do channel bonding on the downstream . I have be pull 30meg down and I only pay for 20 so it be great !
CableModem	NEU	3	the modem be easy to set up and it work well most of the time . I have trouble with it when I do video chat . I always lose the signal .
CableModem	POS	5	this be a great modem , simple to install just call you isp to activate it . no issue so far after activation , speed be good and set by you isp once they be ready to increase you internet speed you be ready for next few year until the next DOCSIS technology come .
CableModem	POS	5	I switch from dsl to cable . I have a Linksy router and this modem plug in and work great . it do not overheat like the modem I have for dsl . another feature be a usb connection with cord for those want to connect this way . I be get up to 15 mb download from my Charter cable connection . so much more efficient then the dsl phone line connection which would have a slower rate in the evening .
CableModem	POS	4	I buy one of these baby because it be by far the cheapest modem I could find out there , and because with Amazon Prime , shipping be lightning fast . I have Comcast by the way . it work great for 4 or 5 day , and then a major Thunderstorm hit my area and there be a few power spike . the modem just stop work . none of my other electronic device be affect -lrb- include my router , which be not connect to a surge protector , my modem be -rrb- . I guess that the electrical current that kill the modem come from the cable jack , not the power supply . I be pretty upset , but I buy another one from the same seller the day after -lrb- 30 dollar be not worth the anguish of deal with Linksys customer support -rrb- , and this time I get a surge protector that insulate the power supply , as well as the cable input . be run great for 2 week now . moral of the story : protect you investment , you internet depend on it .
CableModem	POS	5	Modem be compact fast and do what it be suppose to do . worked right out of the box with no problem and be very easy to hook up .
CableModem	NEG	1	guy , I buy this about 6 month ago and it just die . do not waste you money and look for something else . I be go to check out a Netgear product now .
CableModem	POS	4	I need a reliable modem so I can work from home . buy modem be not exciting by any measure , but this one get the job do .
CableModem	POS	5	work like a charm right out of the box with Comcast , no setup require . the only gotcha be with my AirPort Extreme , just make sure you turn the modem off before plug it in because the modem cache the MAC address of the last device it be plug into .
CableModem	POS	4	my prior modem be a DOCSIS 1.1 model from linksy which have a web base user interface point out in the ship installation Guide . I would have give this Motorola modem a perfect rating if the ship box also include info on how to access the modem 's user interface via a web browser . fortunately , on the motorola.com site I find a detailed pdf installation Guide with the web interface IP address that make up for the miss info . the web address be -lrb- ... -rrb- some people complain about the heat discharge by the modem but I do not think it be hot enough to cause any problem as long as the modem be keep in a well ventilate space .
CableModem	POS	5	after Comcast increase my rental rate for they modem to $ 5\/month and after 8 year , decide to buy my own modem . Works great and be rather easy install . if you be on a mac and use wireless , it be much easier to use ethernet connection for the initial hookup .
CableModem	NEG	1	Stinks , be a lousy modem , give less than 1\/2 speed advertise . I be gonna try buy.com instead . or eBay , shopping.com , of anyone other than AMD .
CableModem	POS	5	it arrive shortly after order . the prong on the plug be a little bent , but I just get out the pliers and fix it . just plug everything in how comcast , or whoever , have theirs set up and you be almost there . the next time you try to log on to the internet , it will walk you through how to register it and then internet will be yours and you will no longer have to pay comcast they 7 dollar every month for a little box that you can install all by yourself .
CableModem	POS	5	I have Comcast internet , and activate this modem be not too bad at all . I have to go through the activation screen about 5 time or so , but it finally work . the modem itself be a breeze to set up , and it be give I a rock-solid connection . I be very happy !
CableModem	POS	4	I be write this in late December , have purchase the unit in September . I 'll put this review in three section : the good , the bad and `` the neutral '' -- the good -- once it be set up I really have no complaint . I purchase a combo cable modem\/switch\/broadband router with wifus and that be exactly what this unit be and do rather effectively . since I buy this unit at the same time I sign up for the comcast account I have nothing to compare it to . my main computer be also connect through a `` ethernet over powerline '' set of adapter which add several m of latency so I can not even comment on that . both wire and wireless connection have be nothing but stable as long as I have have it . my apartment be small so it be not difficult to blanket it with wifus signal . I do not have a 802.11 n device so I can not comment on that . I have a roku box connect directly to the unit and it very rarely if ever drop off . when it do I know it be either comcast or netflix with the issue -lrb- s -rrb- . this unit do seem to have a incredible list of feature built-in . it be like the manufacturer just go through a long check list of every feature imaginable and dump it in . I have only barely scratch the surface on all the feature either because I do not need they or because I could not figure out how to set it up -lrb- see the bad -rrb- . I find out later it be fact possible to use this unit soley as a cable modem , bypass the nat\/router functionality . -- the Bad -- if you ever want to actually use this device for anything outside of the default functionality put on you googling hat and get ready to spend some time : it be quite difficult to figure out what anything be just from the interface and the pdf manual have very minimal explanation of even what the various abbreviation mean never mind how to set they up . for instance I want to utilize the `` guest wifus '' feature so I could set up a old pc with a wifus card that do not support WPA -lrb- I want a wep along side my primary wpa network -rrb- . it be not that critical and I do not want to spend very much time on it but I could not seem to set this up . I be sure if I have spend several hour search the internet and experiment I could have come up with a solution . but this should not be necessary . either the uus should be intuitive enough to set it up , it should be document how to set it up step-by-step or at the very least there should a link some where on Zoom 's site to a third party site that describe how to make it happen . the same go for use this unit purely as a cable modem so I could use my own preferred broadband router -lrb- a linksy with tomatoe firmware -rrb- . I browse the various setting , look up abbreviation in wikipedium . then I google those abbreviation . eventually I find the setting and successfully set up my seperate router -lrb- I find the real solution on a random blog talk about a different modem ... -rrb- . this should not be necessary and be not something 99.99 % of costumer be go to bother with . -lrb- the setting be call `` RgPassThrough '' . recommend disable of wifus , dhcp and NAT , and put the MAC address of the router you want . I never would have guess `` RgPassThrough '' . -rrb- I would also mention the apparent lack of any way to update this modem 's firmware . perhaps this be a regulation put on they by the cable industry but it just seem inexcusable to I in this day and age of network exploit and malicious bot roam the internet . -- Neutral -- since I do not know who be at fault for this issue I be not blame the modem directly : it take more than a hour and at least two different comcast representative to successfully activate this modem . there be only so much the representative could tell I but it sound like it just do not want to talk to comcast 's end . the activation be attempt over and over again for 45 minute or so before it finally just inexplicably start to work . the representative have no explnation . I later attempt to activate a different Motorola modem at the same location and have the exact same issue which lead I to believe it be not the modem but rather the cabling or whatever software\/hardware comcast have on they end . it be very , very frustrating -lrb- never do get the second modem to work -rrb- . once the zoom be activate it could deactivated\/activated instantly with no issue . it be just that initial attempt that be time consuming . again , this could be unique to my region and\/or my particular comcast office for all I know . I live in northern California just outside of Sacramento . -- conclusion -- I be give this device four star for the lack of documentation and non-intuitive web interface . I like the list of feature and as far as I can tell be very effective as a cable modem\/broadband router .
CableModem	POS	4	very quick response to email , product work great ! although it be miss the cable wire it be suppose to come with which i be guess it be suppose to be the ethernet cord .
CableModem	POS	4	I move from a rent modem to this one . it be easy to setup and I could use it right away . since I already check if the modem be compatible with the network provider -lrb- Charter -rrb- , it might have help I . of course , I do not see much spike in speed after move to DOCSIS 3.0 modem , but it might be due to Charter not provide speed of DOCSIS 3.0 . I also do not have the problem of restart the modem . hopefully it do not throw new surprise . ; - -rrb-
CableModem	POS	5	I take a chance and buy a refurbish unit that look almost new -lrb- I notice a few light scratch -rrb- . installation with Comcast do not go smoothly with the automatic procedure but after a phone call to Comcast , it be up and run in a few minute . I have have it run less than a week and in that time the whole system have only crash once -lrb- typical for I -rrb- . I run a speed test with the old modem right before I install the new modem . the old one clock in at 35 mp download and the fastest I have get with the new be 24 mb . slower , but not noticable in my app and I can still stream high-def Netflix well . I read somewhere that it may not download as fast as older model but that it should maintain it be speed better throughout the day . in any case , it seem to work as fast as the original Arris modem that be cost I $ 7 a month . so far I be happy with it ! PS my home phone be now on the internet with magic Jack and that work very well and I need my modem to stay on 24-7 so I be hope this modem work a long time without crash . I have the one crash and be here to fix it quickly -lrb- simple unplug , wait a few seconds , then plug it back in -rrb- . hopefully those will be rare .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem be very easy to set up . it only take one phone call to Comcast , and it have work like a charm since .
CableModem	NEG	1	this modem only last 7 week and rarely work correctly during that time . very disappointed that I didnt keep box so I cant send back
CableModem	POS	5	tired of pay rental charge to the evil cable co so I decide to buy my own . after some research this once come out on top . bought and be a little nervous . so simple to install and take up so much less space than the clunker from the cable co. . glad I switch !
CableModem	POS	5	plug and play , no problem install and have work great for over a month now . will need to call you isp to get it connect to internet , take about 10 minute .
CableModem	POS	5	while look for way to cut down my cable bill , I search around and find this modem . check the approve modem list , this be on there , order it up , few day later it be in my hot little hand . after a quick call to the cable provider -lrb- who need the MAC address -rrb- , it be up and online . I be use this with a Netgear WNR2000 that be flash with dd-wrt , rock solid with no issue so far . definitely one of the easier computer-related project I have do around the house this year : d
CableModem	POS	5	I recently have to install tuning adapter for my TiVo box in order to receive certain high definition channel from Time Warner . these adapter drop the signal down from around 93 to 44 as measure by the TiVo signal strength function . I have a passive 4:1 splitter in the attic which work fine until these adapter be install . after the tuning adapter be install some of the channel would get the dreaded digital signal drop-out . I install this signal booster which take about 15 minute - most of which be just to tie the cable back neatly . now I have 90 to 100 signal level on all of my TiVo box and the picture quality be great . I do not use this on my internet connection as it be run separately from my other cable . product feel very solid and well build . I have only have it a couple of week , so can not comment on the long term reliability , but so far it be a great little unit .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this for my cable modem and I notice a speed increase . the cable guy come by to replace my cable modem and even he notice a significant speed increase with he bandwidth measure device . this will save you lot of time when streaming and download thing off the internet , however , you might be spend more time on the internet since everything will be that much faster .
CableModem	NEG	1	I buy this modem as a replacement for my comcast-rented DOCSIS 2.0 modem , and it work great when I connect my computer directly to the modem . when connect through my Apple Airport Extreme 802.11 n -lrb- 1st generation -rrb- router , though , I begin to see problem . Whenever I be do anything that use a substantial portion of my bandwidth -lrb- e.g. download large file or watch Netflix streaming -rrb- , after a couple of minute I would begin to see ping time to test server rise and eventually stop altogether . the connection would effectively drop for a minute or two , and then it would come back . my problem be very similar to the one report at -lrb- ... -rrb- I have use this router successfully with my prior cable modem , so there must be some incompatibility between the modem and my router . I also know other have report no problem with airport extreme router and this modem -lrb- though I do not know which generation of the airport Extreme they be use -rrb- .
CableModem	POS	5	I recently switch from dsl to high speed internet , basically from CenturyLink to Charter . while talk with the Charter rep , I manage to find the listing of all the modem that they lease out and come across this beauty . I decline to lease this modem from they , as they want $ 7 a month , so you basically buy two of these modem over the course of a two year contract . so this be a no-brainer and I buy it . the technician that come out be surprise to see this modem while hook everything up as the DOCSIS 2.0 modem can not handle very high speed , and this be where the DOCSIS 3.0 come in . I be download speed up to 50 mbp now . I just have to change my wireless router setting to DHCP and the DOCSIS 3.0 take over and I be on my way to the high speed superhighway ! I do not have to go into the modem GUI to mess with any setting either . so basically I hook this up from the coax cable in the wall , feed a cat6 cable from it to my wireless dual band router , set my router to DHCP , and everything on my network instantly have connection . its worth the money if you be look to get speed of over 30mbp to you home and lease one from the cable company be just a waste of money in my opinion .
CableModem	POS	5	deliver in two day , and setup within 20 minute . the latency be about half that of my old -lrb- 10 yr . -rrb- modem , and the speed be noticeably better to . I wish that I would buy it sooner .
CableModem	POS	5	absolutely amazing difference in analog picture quality ! I use a two way splitter to run a line straight to my cable modem as recommend and attach the other cable to the Motorola Booster . from the booster I use three of the four hookup for signal to three tv , one of which I split again with a good two way splitter so that I could drop a line to my computer tv card . before I have horizontal line on many of the channel and a couple be almost unviewable . the line be all go now and the picture on all three analog tv and the computer be terrific ! a unintended side effect be that my cable modem throughput have also increase because it be now be route straight to the computer from the original two way splitter . I wish that I have do this year ago ! if you have analog tv with fuzzy or striped picture I highly recommend this booster !
CableModem	POS	5	this modem work like a charm . I buy this to replace my Comcast rental . I have to call Comcast and give they the MAC ID that be on the box of the modem . afterwards , the installation be a breeze . I just plug in the coax and then power it on . when all the light stabilize , it be good to go . stabilization take about 5-7 min . I actually get 1.5 time more speed than my previous modem .
CableModem	POS	4	I replace a old Ambit unit which seem to be over heating and cause connection issue to the LinkSys cm100 and its be work great for the past few day . I have to call into the isp and have they provision the new modem with be MAC Address and then all be work great . I have notice it handle traffic great , my connection be consistent and most off all I have not lose a internet connection at the modem in a few day ... finger still cross . so far , it seem like a sound product . great price refurbish and I keep the old Ambit one -lrb- which they charge we $ 70 for 3 year ago -rrb- just in case . I give it 4 star because it would have be a great 5 star if it support docsy 3.0 too .
CableModem	POS	5	I use this unit for about a month with Comcast cable . this unit replace the rental from Comcast -lrb- I get tire of pay they $ 7 every month -rrb- . call the company , give they the MAC address and in 5 minute I be back online . so far it seem to work just fine . moderate improvement on the speed and reliability ; satisfy with the purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	there really be not a lot to say . I need a DOCSIS 3 modem and it work like it should . upgrade my Internet speed , consistently get above 50 mbp down . set up be easy , pretty much plug in and let you provider have it be MAC address . indicator light be easy to read . overall , very satisfied with the modem .
CableModem	POS	5	Modem be not plug and play . spend about 45 minute on the phone with Comcast to get modem working . have to supply the serial number and MAC ID number . however , when I get it work , my speed go from 13mb download with the my old Motorola Surfboard to 33mb download with the 6120 . similarly , upload go from 1.3 mb to 6mb . Works great once it be configure with you isp .
CableModem	POS	5	this work great while i have it , I upgrade my service and could no longer use it . this be a great modem if you play game or do video online .
CableModem	POS	4	Took Comcast about 2 hour to install , over the phone , late August 17 , 2012 . laptop gigabit controller would not properly recognize modem and would run only at 10 mb instead of 1000 . use a Dell XPS l511z to connect to modem . when I hook the laptop up before call Comcast the LAN would run at 1000 mb . Comcast could not get the lan to run over 10 , so they suggest try another computer . use a older xp m140 laptop purchase 6 year ago but run Windows 7 and it work at its network card 's max rate , 100 mb . restart modem and then hook it to Netgear router -lrb- 100 mb WAN input -rrb- and it seem to work fine with wire lan run at 100 mb , but the internet do go out unexpectedly once but start right up when I reset the router , but not the modem . the modem show it be get a internet connection , but the router show no internet connection . have Comcast blast -lrb- advertise here in dc metro area at 50 down\/10 up -rrb- . Got letter from Comcast recommend upgrade to 3.0 modem and this modem get they 3 star test and be recommend . previous modem Motorola SB5101 work fine and be 5 year old , but its download max be about 38 and sometimes just over 40 , but speed vary a lot and it be never consistent . upload be usually less than 4 . with sb6121 , speed be consistently 52 download and 10 upload . wifus download be about half the wire rate when the laptop be close to router , use Netgear usb 72 mb wireless . wifus upload be 10 . it seem to be work well .
CableModem	POS	4	... it seem that various isp be break FCC regulation and Federal Law by refuse to activate some newer modem , in a attempt to force user to use a `` lease '' modem . there be a essentially identical version of this device , the sb6141 , which be the `` isp lease '' version of this . you can not buy that , at least not `` officially , '' mind you . Time Warner Cable have just have I on the `` loop '' for the past two and a half hour , and I be still on hold as I write this . they be tell I that the device be not on the `` approved list '' and thus can not be activate on they system . this , of course , be patent nonsense . all they require in order to access any device be -lrb- a -rrb- a device which speak the same electronic `` language '' -lrb- in this case , DOCSIS 3.0 , which TWC Austin support fully , and brag about support fully -rrb- , and -lrb- b -rrb- a valid , unique hfc MAC ID code . the MAC ID be what allow the two device -lrb- the isp 's `` source '' modem and you modem -rrb- to talk to each other , as the isp need to know that the ID it be talk to be a id which it be suppose to talk to , and they need to speak the same language . that be all that be REQUIRED ON ANY TECHNICAL BASIS whatsoever . it be a violation of Federal Law and FCC regulation for a isp to refuse to service any device which have a valid , unique , and `` not steal '' MAC ID and which use a approve communication protocol . those of you who have be tell `` Comcast will not support this '' or , as I just be , `` Time Warner will not support this , '' please realize , you be be rob , every bit as much as if they put a gun to you head and tell you to hand over you wallet . it be a crime for they to do this . I be currently on hold , with a `` customer advocate '' at Time Warner , attempt to get my personally-owned , legally-required-to-be-supported device add to my account . \*\*\*\*\*\* okay , after a long dialog where I quote letter and verse of Federal law to the `` advocate , '' I get they to add my modem to my account . and it be work flawlessly . I would not ordinarily post thing not specifically about the device on a review of the device , but in this case , I feel like it be necessary , as some folk may believe they have get a defective piece of hardware -lrb- base upon what the isp tell they -rrb- when this be not the case . my ping time have improve ... which be somewhat surprising to I , honestly ... from about 58m to around 20m . I be not sure why that be the case , but it be a good indication that I have a better connection -lrb- lower ping time mean less delay between when you send something at one end and when it be receive at the other end , basically -rrb- . my throughput be much more consistent and level , and I have not see any of the disconnection error I have see repeatedly with my older -lrb- DOCSIS 1.0 -rrb- modem . it seem to be perform flawlessly . if you have a internet service provider -lrb- isp -rrb- who have support for DOCSIS 3.0 -lrb- the latest iteration of the modem-interaction-language standard -rrb- , this be a great choice . just be prepare to have to argue a bit with you isp , who seem , in many case , to be do everything possible to get you to lease one from they instead of buy you own . once they give in and agree to activate the MAC code on they system , this will work just fine on ANY current isp , and will provide full DOCSIS 3.0 support on any DOCSIS 3.0-supporting network . do not let the script-reading `` support '' type tell you otherwise .
CableModem	POS	4	I buy this modem to replace my cable modem . this modem work great . the installation be very simple and easy . and since then I have have no problem .
CableModem	POS	5	a return this item because rcn -lrb- my cable company -rrb- have trouble get it to work . if you want to be frugal and save that $ 5\/mo . it be worth the purchase !!
CableModem	POS	5	to decide which DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem to use , 1st go to DOCSIS Devices MyDeviceInfo on Comcast to see what they support and possibly recommend by certification . for my money , only 2 option :  Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem  choose the later , newer model . more widely use sb6120 be test only to level 2 . Comcast claim to have test sb 6121 to more stringent level 3 certification . Hope to future proof with use this newer model . have not notice , as other , heat to be a problem . Install & SetUp be easy . help reading comment from user -lrb- Comcast employee -rrb- with sb6120 . do not try Comcast self activation web page since this be a modem change and not a new install . plug sb6121 into WAN Cable with nothing else attach . then call Comcast Tech support . change from Linksys BEFCMU10 v4 DOCSIS 2.0 to Motorola SB6121 DOCSIS 3.0 . Comcast see Device , send refresh signal . Voila ! then connected pc direct to Cable Modem . finish with Comcast Tech support . take maybe 20 minute on phone to verify all be work . final hookup with router , in the mix , and clone pc MAC Address into Router . do processing ! accord to sb6121 log , sw download successful - Via Config file , SW Download INIT - Via Config file . MAC Address Identified . light , Camera Action . Houston , we have connection ! be it faster than what we have ? no. . why Upgrade ? concerned about end of Life Devices for what we have .  cisco-linksy befcmu10 Ethernet Cable Modem  prior version do . piece of mind to stay one step ahead of obsolescent technology . why buy vs. rent ? not fond of rent . will pay for its self in less than a year . try RoadRunner Cable Modem then later try Comcast Cable Modem neither of which would connect reliably . both have weak signal require a service call mean down time . purchase Cable modem would always work . have own 2 linksy befcmu10 v4 DOCSIS 2.0 Cable modem . purchase for $ 20.00 each -lrb- elsewhere -rrb- when they be sell for $ 80.00 each , so have a backup . First Linksys befcmu10 v4 buy the farm during a lighten strike . yes , even on a UPS . the lighten strike take out the Cable Modem and a D-Link 8 Port Gigabit switch . two router , in line for security , in between be untouched . now that I think of it , 1 router lose 1 Port leave 3 more port to use . unfortunate but still a usable device . second linksy befcmu10 v4 have work until now . have sit on shelf for backup \/ book end . happy with decision to go sb6121 Gigabit Cable Modem to  D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router  and if we ever upgrade we Comcast to 100baset or Comcast upgrade to ipv6 , wow . I can dream !
CableModem	NEG	1	just google for ` cisco dpc3008 customer support ' and you 'll see that one of the top hit be the comcast customer forum where hundred of people complain about the dpc3008 drop internet connection . because this modem be list on Comcast 's web site as a approve modem , I buy one 3 month ago . I have have nothing but trouble with it and to my surprise , discover that many other people be experience the same problem . under somewhat heavy load such as streaming a movie , the modem drop the internet connection . the only solution be to use a different modem . I replace the dpc3008 with a Motorola surfboard and have not have any problem . I would stay away from the dpc3008 , it do not work reliably . it 'll be the last Cisco product I ever purchase .
CableModem	POS	4	when charter cable up the rental fee to $ 7 a month it become silly not to buy we own modem . I buy this Motorola surfboard base on good review , and after 5 month of use it have prove very reliable , offer consistent , reasonably high speed without need to be re-plugged more than once . it be only drawback be a few design flaw . note : other have describe this modem as nearly identical to the Motorola surfboard sb6120 except more expensive and with a prettier but warmer-running case . normally this would steer I toward the older model but because some charter user experience firmware problem that turn they sb6120 into brick , I go with the newer model just to be safe . the price be still quite reasonable consider that after one year it will have pay for itself in rental fee . pro : so far we have speed equal to the modem we use to rent , and occasionally higher . it be easy to set up and only once have I have to unplug the modem to get internet working , although that may have be a problem with the router . it be important to note that unless you be pay big buck for super-high speed you may not be get d3 rate anyway . but unless you be strap for cash or certain that you will never , ever upgrade , it be not a bad idea to have the option and plan for the future . con : the sb6121 be sometimes warm to the touch . I would not describe it as hot . however , we have it free standing -lrb- not stack beneath something else -rrb- and in the cool basement , so it be not a problem . the illuminate led icon be easy to see but the icon themselves be somewhat obscure . it be useful to know that the top icon actually change color depend on the speed of you connection -lrb- which will also depend upon the computer its connect to -rrb- so if you get a amber light , do not assume the modem be not work . there be no reset button on the modem , as some version of this model seem to advertise . this be not a huge drawback for I . Bottom Line : for steady speed equal to what we be rent , a reasonable price in the long run , ease of setup , and long period of internet without interruption , I give this modem 4 star . for the minor flaw of chare more for a new case that run on the warm side and be needlessly cryptic with its cute icon I take off one star .
CableModem	POS	5	I have 2 house set up with 2 different cable company , both of which use the Motorola SB6121 Modem . initially , I use a Motorola Modem with a 1.0 docsis at my Florida home but internet service be intermittent . I replace the modem with the sb6121 and the problem be cure . when Mediacom start charge a monthly fee at my Iowa home , I immediately purchase another sb6121 and return the Mediacom Modem . the Motorola sb6121 perform flawlessly in both Florida and Iowa home and that be the name of the game : reliability .
CableModem	POS	5	I purchase a refurbish one and it work great . it be less expensive than the other . I would recommend it .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem work right away on Comcast 's network . just have to go through the provision process and register over the phone .
CableModem	NEU	3	I buy this because I be move to Comcast Internet , and I want a fast modem that would not give I any trouble . unfortunately , the first one keep power cycling when I get it hook up . I call Motorola tech support , who tell I that a low sigal to noise ratio be cause the power cycle . I call Comcast , and they tech come out and fix the low snr problem , but the modem keep power cylcing . he replace it with a Comcast modem , which work just fine . the replacement modem that I get work fine , but I be only rating this 3 star because of the hassle I have to go through get it to work .
CableModem	POS	5	this cable modem work great with my Comcast service in the Bay Area . I have blast service which be advertise to provide 30 mbp download speed , and I get over 30 mbp with this modem connect to my 4 year old laptop when I perform a speedtest on the comcast website . it also show over 6mbp of upload speed . keep in mind that this be the case when I connect the router directly to the laptop with a ethernet cable . if you attach a wireless router it will most likely not give you the same result but that be due to the wireless router . I get over 20 mbp with the linksy e3200 wireless router which I buy to complement this cable modem and I would recommend the Linksys e3200 if you be look for a fast dual-band wireless router to pair up with this modem . as for the installation , it could not have be easier for I . Comcast have originally rent I this same modem for 7 month -lrb- $ 49 I throw away in rent -rrb- so when the new modem arrive , I simply disconnect the old ubee modem and plug in the new uBee Docsis 3.0 Cable Modem . when I turn on my firefox internet browser it divert I to the comcast installation page where I follow the step -lrb- you need you account number -rrb- and within a few minute it detect the new modem and I have internet ! simple as that , no need to call comcast in my case or look for any MAC address . keep in mind that this be probably the case because I be rent the same exact ubee cable modem , but if you do need to call Comcast , the MAC address be easily accessible on the bottom of the cable modem . now 3 month after I buy the modem I have save $ 21 and I be happily continue to save with little to no issue in connectivity !
