Keyboard	POS	5	always a satisfaction to buy a Microsoft product . and this product be not different , exelente comfort and usual to who pass much time typing .
Keyboard	POS	5	this thinkg work great ! I stream tv show through my computer onto my tv . I use thing as a remote so i can do everything from my couch ! the battery last a very long time too ! it hasnt die on I yet and its be leave on for 5 day .
Keyboard	NEG	2	I love Logitech , and I hold they product to a higher standard than the rest . this one be well-designed , but it have a serious problem -lrb- for gamer , at least -rrb- . overall , this be a good , attractive board -- assume you do not get the problem I have . the board work most of the time , but randomly , sometimes a couple time a hour , the light will blink and it will turn itself off . then , even when the board become power again , it will not work . this be insanely annoying in FPS game , especially multiplayer one . I have make sure that this be not a issue with my computer itself . it be isolate to the keyboard . ignore that problem , the board be pretty good . it be comfortable , feel solid , and have lot of button -lrb- include 18 macro on the left side , very useful -rrb- . it be not ergonomic at all , but that be not a big issue for gamer . the key have smooth response with just the right amount of push force , and the board look good overall . it be not without its shortcoming . the lighting be somewhat uneven and sometimes look a bit cheap . if you have you keyboard right in front of you monitor -lrb- s -rrb- , the light key may be harder to see than normal white one . I really wish all the blue key be as bright as the yellow m1 key . the board include two usb port , but they be only usb 1.1 . it would be nice to plug mouse into they , since it would give a wire gamer more travel slack on the cord , but for I , I find it too risky to plug my mx-518 into it because of the risk of lose both my mouse and keyboard to the power loss . the lesson I learn ? fancy gimmick do not a gaming board make . light and fancy frill be a excuse to skimp on other , more important thing .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be look for a mouse\/keyboard combo . the best mouse that I could find be by logitech , but be not pair with a keyboard . so I buy this keyboard and it go perfectly with my mouse and the computer .
Keyboard	POS	4	price at $ 99.99 be a bargain . with the upcome Honeycomb firmware come soon this differently will be the streaming media to have . I love the feature and easy access with the include keyboard . I have the roku streaming media as well and use both due to that some content can not be find in one or the other device . but over all be aim to stream more content via internet integration and will get better as soon the new release version become available .
Keyboard	POS	5	use my laptop at home I find myself touch the cursor pad , and move it around what I be typing . also my old mouse be act up , so I get this combo pack . it do and excellent job & I would recommend it to anyone .  Logitech Wireless Desktop mk320 with keyboard and mouse
Keyboard	POS	4	I drop the cash on this expect just a average product , or just a cheap knockoff of the much more fancy $ 30 cover from the iSkin website . I be pleasantly surprise when I open the package and stick it on , and find that it just happen to be pretty dang snazzy . it look good , feel good , and fit really well . the key line up perfectly , none of that awkward double character effect . the backlighting be subdue a lot , but not so much that it be render useless or anything . as far as typing go , it feel natural . it take about 2 minute to get use to it , then the `` this be weird '' effect wear off . not to mention , this cover just make any typing SO SO comfortable ! the post do say high grade silicone , and they deliver on that ! overall : Worth the money , but I would caution buyer about the packaging when ship . seriously ? a envelope ? I pay $ 4.95 to have this ship , and it come to I in a old brown envelope . the product be fine , but there be much that could have go wrong . beyond that however , I highly recommend this product , it will extend the life of you mac at least 5 fold .
Keyboard	POS	5	ok - this thing be really inexpensive ; which be great . I really only buy it for the colorful splash it would give my computer , and it do that perfectly . here be the irony of the whole purchase ... within a half hour of the box deliver , a spill 1\/2 a open soda all over my laptop . without this sweet cover , my computer would have be toast . BEST $ 5 I have ever spent !!
Keyboard	POS	5	as a full size keyboard and full fuction mouse with great range , this be a excellent product . set-up take a minute or so and the connection with the computer be do from a very small usb connector . since I rarely use all my usb slot this work perfectly for I . when the connector be put in , it automatically download the driver to Windows 7 . I be use the combo a couple of minute after open the box . what I like about the keyboard be that be extremely easy to get use to and full size . I rarely make a typing mistake , it have all the key I need and I have go back a good 20 foot and it be still within-range of the usb connector . there be really no waste space on the keyboard but at the same time it do not seem crowd . but this be the one drawback for some people that I want to point out . the keyboard be long and rigid . it could become a transportation problem depend upon how people want to use this product . if you be use a small netbook this would be a excellent product at home or at work , but if you want it as a travel companion be aware of the size . the mouse also have great range , good feel , and it have work on every surface I have try it on without lose any accuracy . the software will install if you want a small screen box that allow you to do cap and number lock from the screen and also show you the connection and battery status of the keyboard and mouse . Bottomline be a good quality product and a good value for the price . it would make use a netbook or even a laptop much easier . battery be supply , set-up be easy , and you will be up and click and typing in a couple of minute . just know what you want . this be a rigid-non folding keyboard that be quite long . if you be ok with that , then this be a excellent choice .
Keyboard	POS	5	buy the wireless keyboard and mouse for use it with my MacBook pro OS X 10.6.8 . Works well for all the basic function . note on keyboard 1 . Amazon state operate only with the window pc but check with Logitech confirm it should work fine with the Macs as well . 2 . out of the `` fn '' key capability I could only make the power off key to work . all the other be tie to operate for window . 3 . from the additional extra feature key locate on the very top of the of the keyboard , I could make only the forward , play , reverse , volume and folder key to work . calculator key do not work . 4 . basic qwerty keyboard work fine . 5 . use the `` window key '' as the Mac command key to operate you regular mac feature . it work well for my need . I have not experience any obvious issue with the mouse and it seem to work fine . as for battery life it all depend on usage but I know its not bad as I have not have to replace battery since I buy it . tip : switch off the keyboard and mouse at the end of the day or whenever you do not intend to use the device for a long period of time . this definitely conserve battery power .
Keyboard	POS	5	when my 3-year old Microsoft wireless keyboard bit the dust last week , I have to briefly use a spare , straight , non-ergonomic keyboard and it feel awful . what a relief when I get the Logitech keyboard in the mail yesterday ! very comfortable to type on , fit my keyboard tray just right , feel better to type on than the Microsoft keyboard do . and the laser mouse that come with it in this combo package also be a pleasure to use . the keyboard have a lot of functional capability that I probably will not use , but that be just icing on the cake . the comfort , for I , be the best feature of this keyboard . this be a excellent choice , if I do say so myself .
Keyboard	POS	5	my girlfriend want this for she MacBook pro . she purchase a pink case on Amazon as well and I think she would like this one and she be be want a keyboard cover . as soon as she get it , she love right away .
Keyboard	POS	5	when I really like a product , I be always curious about the negative review . with this keyboard , it appear that these concern personal preference that no single keyboard can fulfill for all user . I guess that some day there may be a keyboard that can be modify by the user to any sublayout , key size , and the like . this keyboard can not do that , but it be about as perfect for I as they come . the keyboard layout be standard and straightforward : no touchpad , special key , etc. -lrb- well , there be those speaker key above the numeric keypad . . I do not use they , but they also do not make the keyboard larger -rrb- . I like that because it keep the size to a minimum without diminish the usefulness -- for I . it be not particularly important to I that it be really thin , but I really like that look . now the important stuff . the key feel good to I , and I think that as long as key have good tactile feedback , you will get use to whatever keyboard you use and come to like that feel . you brain adapt , which mean that if you use another keyboard with a different feel , you will not favor that at first either . someone do note that the f and j key be not as easy to feel as on some keyboard , but you get use to that as well . I be attract to this keyboard because I sometimes like to work in a room with muted illumination . I would find that sometimes I would need to punch a key that I do not use much -lrb- say , a f-function key -rrb- and would struggle to find it . that be not a problem now . I start use wireless keyboard 2 keyboard ago , and will never go back to cable . I love not have another cable on my desktop . plus , I can type with the keyboard in another position if I have to -lrb- troubleshoot the computer , etc. -rrb- . the tradeoff have always be the battery , but the rechargeable nature of this keyboard be wonderful . I charge they first when I get the keyboard about a month ago , and it be still on full . and , if the battery need recharge , I just plug in the usb cable for a hour or so , and can still use the keyboard . I have to admit that I really like Logitech product , have be use they since the first 3-button -lrb- ! -rrb- mouse in the early 1980 's . I have never use a Logitech product I do not like . maybe I be bias .
Keyboard	POS	5	the item be great , it work especially well in poorly light area ! the back light keyboard have be the best I have see and I highly recommend
Keyboard	POS	4	the Steelseries g6v2 be space efficient , heavy , and have a excellent tactile feel to it . it be a perfect keyboard for those who never have a mechanical keyboard before . the only criticism I have be that the shift key and backspace feel different and worn compare the the rest of the key and that the Return\/Enter key displace the \ | key down near \/ ? which be tricky to get use to .
Keyboard	POS	5	if you be in need of a serviceable replacement for you Mac keyboard , at a fraction of the price of a Mac brand keyboard , this be the keyboard you want . it be a little noisier than the Mac keyboard , but in term of user-friendliness and styling you will not do better in term of function or price . the media key at the top of the keyboard be handy too . the only superfluous key seem to be the power on key at the top right , which will not actually power on my iMac . I still have to hit the power on button on the back of the iMac unit itself . other than that , I find this keyboard a great , neatly-priced replacement for my old Mac keyboard , which start to lose key function , key by key .
Keyboard	POS	4	overall , this item be well worth the money . I would like it if it have more clip on the top of the screen but overall it be secure and fit well . look just like the picture .
Keyboard	NEG	1	this adapter would not connect any work PS\/2 keyboard to the usb port on either of the two pc I need to connect . very unsatisfactory . I solve my problem with a different -lrb- keyboard & mouse -rrb- adapter .
Keyboard	NEG	2	this keyboard be cheaper than its Sony brand competitor for a excellent reason - it be simply not as good . I be a fairly good typist , and this be \* much \* slower than use Graffiti to enter information .  you have to poke and push very hard to get the keystroke to register , and the divide nature of the keyboard make it very difficult to get up any speed at all . I could not type more than a few word without have to go back and add miss or extra letter .  I would only recommend this keyboard if you can not cope with graffitus at all . enter any large amount of text will simply take you too long and drive you insane with the pointlessness of become a two-fingered typist otherwise .
Keyboard	NEU	3	this be a great keyboard in theory . I love the feel and consistency of the key , and the variability of the backlight . I can do some serious typing on this keyboard and enjoy every moment of it . well , assume I remove all of the macro key , which I do . they get in the way -- I align my hand by feel , base on where my left pinky find the edge of the last row of key . if you stick a extra column of key there , I line up too far to the left and disaster and frustration ensue . for a day or so I try to jam my pinky in the crevasse between the macro key and the normal key , but that be uncomfortable and make it difficult to hit Tab . then I try to position my hand in a more traditional typing posture , which do not work very well . I could have stick with it and re-learn to type , but I like the way I type now and do not want to change , so I pop off the macro key and all be well . only downside be , the blue led be pretty bright without key to obscure they . I might paint or tape over they . issue number two be that in low light , the painting on the key be very hard to see because it be dark gray . the light-up portion of the key be fine -- perfect , in fact . the altered font do not bother I at all . what do bother I be that I have to lean in and closely examine the key to figure out what they shift function be because I can not see they . Blue lead + dark gray paint + black key = very poor usability and visibility , especially in low or no light situation . lastly , my keyboard arrive defective , but it take a day or two to notice how . the spacebar be just a little too loose , so when I hit it at any kind of angle with my thumb , it will grind against the x or the m key , depend on which thumb I use . this cause superfluous xe and m , cause I lot of frustration . I try to adjust the spacebar to see if it be out of alignment or something -- there be nothing I can do , it be just not work right and have to go back . so I have request a exchange from Amazon . unfortunately , it be out of stock and I be still wait for a new one after two week . in summary , I like this keyboard and can not imagine use anything else anymore . I just wish it be better design and better manufacture .
Keyboard	POS	5	this keyboard be great . it install instantly and be work flawlessly ... for a reasonable price . the curvature of the keyboard be a nice touch as I do a lot of typing .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I originally give this a high rating but remove it when , after have it for only a couple of week , find that a entire row of key stop work . I originally like the price , about a third of a Apple original , the light and compact frame and the action of the key , but seriously , I will not buy this brand again and will think twice about the re-seller as well .
Keyboard	POS	4	personally , I love this keyboard . no one be more resistant to change than I be , so it be highly unusual for I to try , let alone use , such a untraditional-looking product . this keyboard do take a little get use to -- make no mistake about that . the hardest thing for I have be find the `` 6 '' key -lrb- across the top -rrb- -- it be on the leave `` half '' of the keyboard , a fact which my right hand sometimes have trouble remember . yes , the arrow key be a little small , and the Insert-Delete-Home-End-PageUp-PageDown key be not really `` instinctively '' position , but the Delete key be the only one of these that I use a great deal , and it be still at the bottom left of that set of key , just where it should be . I use a standard keyboard all day at work , and I have no problem go back and forth between the two , so that should not be too big of a issue among prospective buyer of this product .  while I have no wrist problem , I know that I do not type `` correctly . '' I have try wrist pad before , and I utterly despise they . I be not the type of person to buy something because it be `` ergonomic . '' frankly , I buy this keyboard because it be `` unusual '' and because I still trust Microsoft 's name on a product . as it turn out , I get a comfortable keyboard that just so happen to significantly help my typing posture -- not a bad deal . you can buy a keyboard with a bunch of internet and shortcut key , but why waste money on those little extra ? give this keyboard a try , especially those of you who just can not stand wrist pad , and I bet you -lrb- and you wrist -rrb- will come to really like this product .
Keyboard	NEG	2	I give this product a try hope to use it to control my media laptop connect to my home theater . it look and feel solid in the hand and come in a nice box . unfortunately , while the product work fine close to the laptop , if the unit be more than 4 foot away from the receiver it only work intermittantly and by the time you reach 6ft away it do not respond at all . it just do not work when I be sit on my couch try to control the laptop . also for some odd reason if I use the laser pointer -lrb- which I honestly care nothing about -rrb- it would break the bluetooth pairing and you would need to use another mouse to re-connect the device I may have recive a faulty unit but I have notice other complain of short range as well so I have decide to return the unit for a refund and explore other option .
Keyboard	POS	4	good product ! - the keypad feel good - soft and rubbery . - soften key click slightly , but more than that it change the sound . I like the new sound more . - I be sure it protect the keyboard well . nothing 's happen to it yet since I get the product today , but from other review it protect from spill , dust , dirt , etc. . but a couple of problem : - CAN NOT see the letter on the key with the backlight - normally it shine through the clear letter on the key but it do not anymore . this be probably the biggest problem with it -lrb- and clearly not a huge deal -rrb- - it be be less than a day of use it and a tiny hole have appear . I do not know if it be there when it ship or if my brother tear it , or if it be a problem with the product itself , but it be there -lrb- although it be really really small . -rrb- - came in the mail so it be a little bent , and not quite a perfect fit on the arrow key or the edge . - dust stick to it since it be a little sticky . I have not wash it yet but hopefully it 'll be easy to wash . over all , it look , feel , and sound great , but it do not work as well as I hope . but since it be on sale when I buy it - go down from 20 dollar to 2.48 - it be definitely worth the price . I would buy it for up to 5 dollar - buy it for any more would be a waste .
Keyboard	NEG	1	do yourself a favor and save yourself the 90 + dollar . this thing be a flimsy , cheap plastic piece of junk that rely on the pressure of two plastic piece , compress together to keep itself attach to you chair . I be very excite to try this out , since I renovate my office a bit and remove my formal desk , and now need a place to rest my kbd and mouse . talk about depressing . the box it come in have better production value . first , the keyboard tray be completely separate from the rest of the mount item , so at any second the thing be bump , jiggle , or downright fall off during normal movement . not to mention it be literally a black piece of plastic no better or bigger than the smallest , cheapest cut board you could buy for you kitchen . next , the armrest mount , when mount evenly have a little piece that fit inside in order to adjust for the curve of you chair armrest . this piece will fall out with hardly any provocation . also , the bracket that hold the front and back in place be do so with screw - that 's right - it be not like they be adjustable , smooth piece that snap into place like you would expect - you literally have to take these small rough edge bracket and screw they into the bottom of the armrest cover . and because you be simply hold they in place with pressure - guess what - any bump against the back of the armrest cover and the whole thing slide forward dump everything in the floor . oh and do I mention that if you use this on a chair with a wood frame you just scratch the hell out of the wood ? yea - you do . additionally , the armrest sit in so far that unless you have a super-sized chair base , or be anorexic , you can expect to not be able to spread out , or sit as comfortably as you like , or on some chair , literally have this thing dig into you . I could see where you basic , run of the mill , 30 dollar office chair with a short back and tiny armrest would probably do ok with this thing -lrb- but then , why would you need it since you would probably have a desk to go with that kind of chair -rrb- , but for 90 dollar - I mean really - 90 buck ?? - you would be better off get one of those laptop station with the beanbag bottom that fit in you lap for half the price . I literally put this thing on three different chair , test each one for a full hour or so of normal operation , and throw it back in the box . mobo should be ashamed of themselves for put such a price tag of this crap . this be not worth it , but spend you money how you want .
Keyboard	POS	5	i recently buy this item as a christmas gift and i test it out to make sure it be worth what i have pay for it . and it be ! this lightweight keyboard be a must have . i do not have any reception problem and the mouse be so great . it feature many shortcut for internet surfer . it be comfortable and stowsaway easily when not in use .
Keyboard	POS	4	I have recently be give the opportunity to work at home . by which I mean , the boss tell I that `` nobody in this office want to look at you dumb face any more '' . ` Opportunity ' , ` ostracism ' . it be all semantics . anyway , if my face and I be go to work at home , I want to do it in comfort . so I set about make myself a ergonomic space to work in . if I really want to cast off the shackle of workplace injury , I have to escape from the desk . with this keyboard , I can type in any position -- sit in my chair , hold it in my lap , lie on the floor , or stretch out on the couch . especially stretch out on the couch . grant , I can not see the monitor from there , but as long as the keyboard be in my hand -- or by my foot , or under my head while I be doze -- then I be ` work ' . a awful lot of my email start out `` Dear fksannnnnnn ... '' , but that be a small price to pay for eliminate repetitive motion injury and wonky back spasm . awesome product !
Keyboard	POS	4	still love the layout of this keyboard . I can not stand typing on a standard keyboard for over a few hour , and this one seem to fit I best ergonomically . it be a little pricey for be so loud -lrb- clickity click click -rrb- , but still my favorite solution .
Keyboard	POS	5	I get this a replacement for another keyboard that die on we . we have only have it a few week , but no complaint here . it work well and do not feel cheap .
Keyboard	NEG	1	`` Works with you exist hdtv and cable or satellite system to provide seamless access to the web , you tv , compatible dvr , and Android app ... '' no , it do not . the revue do not give you `` seamless access to the web . '' and it do not allow you to download and run android app . I buy a revue when it be first release . since then software `` update '' have make it actually do less than when I first get it . when it first arrive I could use it to browse and play video from my media server . now , it display `` Network Error '' as I try to browse folder on the server and , if I be lucky enough to be able to list the video in a folder , it display `` Video Error '' for about half the video I try to play . the hardware be great . the software be not . we have be promise update to the software for month and all we get be `` security update '' that break existing functionality . until the software be fix , statement like `` Works with you exist hdtv and cable or satellite system to provide seamless access to the web , you tv , compatible dvr , and Android app ... '' be out-right lie and false advertising .
Keyboard	POS	4	I be use the keyboard for a computer I have hook up to my live room television , when I be sit on my couch . need to get a usb extension cord to make sure the keyboard could see the receiver , but after that it be work pretty well . miss letter sometimes when I get in a fast typing groove , but overall , it work great for its purpose , be a convenient keyboard and mouse pad together that I can use across the room . a standard keyboard and mouse be definitely better , mean more precise , and less miss , if you situation would allow for it .
Keyboard	POS	4	I buy this keyboard for use with a new raspberry pi . unfortunately , it cause problem with the r-pi and force you to unplug the keyboard and plug it back in again after about 50 keystroke . otherwise , its a nice keyboard for the price . Works fine on my Mac . some of the key be a bit small and it will take some get use to .
Keyboard	POS	4	great product ! it be a minor adjustment get use to key , as they seem to ` stick ' at first . -lrb- though the skin be soft and smooth , not tacky . -rrb- in particular , the space bar be a issue for I , need too apply more pressure for it to work . less of a problem , now that my finger have adjust . also , I love that the keyboard be protect from the usual dust\/dirt , require less cleaning , and less worry about spill ! the color be fun , too . I 'll probably order the blue and the black , too !
Keyboard	NEG	2	feature be great , however it have some issue where if you press the space bar on the top right corner , then it produce friction with the body of the keyboard . the friction thus cause the space bar to not go down at once or it cause the user to have to apply more -lrb- un-ergonomic -rrb- pressure .
Keyboard	POS	4	I have have no problem , the keyboard be good and I enjoy typing on it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy this as a replacement for a old -lrb- but good , I think -rrb- Gateway keyboard . this be the best keyboard I have use in my 30 year of use computer . well build and for I it be the Rolls Royce of keyboard . the fact that it be a smaller layout work fine for I . I have average size hand that fit very nicely on the soft touch key . plus it be a classy look piece
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use this keyboard at work for year and like it so much that I purchase one for home use as well .
Keyboard	POS	4	have the infrare version as well this by far be the best ir need to be point to the computer and you need to constantly check the screen if you mistype anything its not the case with this BT device love the size love the mousepad work great def reco
Keyboard	NEU	3	Disapointed in the `` super-loose '' feel of the mouse scroll wheel and the mouse 's smallish overall size . also , I would have prefer a larger keyboard delete key which be on other model .
Keyboard	POS	5	I receive this today in the mail and start use it as soon as I open the box . it require 2 AAA Batteries so if you do not want to be replace the battery every so often I would recommend buy some rechargeable one . now for the main review ... \* the keybaord be very slim and it have a nice look to it . it really do look like a original Apple Keyboard except the material be different . \* if you dont use it for a certain amount of time the keyboard automatically stop work with the device until you press a button on the keyboard . this be very convincent in order to save battery life . \* it have numerous button the control feature such as the brightness of the screen of the device and the volume of the device . this be also very convinient instead of go into you setting to change something like that . \* I be a pretty fast typer and there be no lag what so ever on this keyboard . I have have other keyboard before in which I experience lag , but not in this one . overall this be a really great keyboard that I recommend for all of you that want to type faster than use you touch keyboard . I rate this product 5 star out of 5 star ! no bad thing about it what so ever ! I hope this review help you out !
Keyboard	POS	5	this be a standard Dell keyboard . as such it be very high quality , it be great to find one at this price .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I switch over to bluetooth keyboard and mouse from the lenovo after 6 mouth of use . i be shock how fast the bluetooth keyboard be compare to this . the rollerball be bad on my hand and do not move that far .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I buy the mouse\/keyboard to supplement my office laptop for two reason :  1 -rrb- for ergonomic reason , I want a wireless keyboard that fit into my desk 's small pull-out keyboard tray , while still allow room for a full-size mouse on the same tray . the keyboard fit perfectly . the keyboard be similar in size to a laptop keyboard , so do not buy it if you want a regular full-size desktop keyboard .  2 -rrb- the idea of a in-air mouse seem cool . ok , it be cool , but it be not easy to control smoothly . the only situation where I 'll use the in-air function be when I be give a presentation with my laptop screen be project onto a wall screen , and I need stand away from the laptop .  as someone who have suffer a previous repetitive stress injury related to computer usage , I find my hand hurt use this mouse within the first hour of use . in my opinion , the mouse be too narrow , cause I to unnaturally clench my hand around the mouse to grasp it . as such , I do not use the mouse . everyone be different . test this mouse at a store , if you can , before purchase .  my solution be to buy a separate Microsoft wireless mouse . yeah , that be right , I have separate usb antenna for my keyboard and mouse plug into my laptop . it be a shame about the Gyration mouse be narrow , because I think a in-air mouse would have good potential for people with certain disability . a crude measurement show perhaps a 3\/8ths of a inch difference in the width of the front end of the two mouse , but the contour of a wider mouse be important to I .
Keyboard	POS	4	if you spend a lot of time in front of a computer , you should invest the money to get the right keyboard for you usage . Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard rate somewhere between three-and-a-half star and four star for those who risk carpel tunnel syndrome from overuse of computer mouse , e.g. , in corporate financial analyst circle . the UltraNav keyboard mitigate problem cause from overuse of computer mouse by incorporate TrackPoint and touchpad point device on the keyboard itself . compare to the grip that be require to actively control a mouse , the TrackPoint require pressure from only one finger ; while the touchpad can be control by a light touch . as other reviewer indicate , Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard be lightweight , and of a solid build quality . I find the UltraNav 's trackpoint to be perfectly configure out-of-box . other trackpoint device -lrb- I have use Dell and HP Compaq corporate laptop -rrb- feel `` loose '' by comparison . the UltraNav 's touchpad support virtual click -- which simulate mouse click by quickly tap on the touchpad ; and virtual scrolling -- which enable quick scroll down or across a window by slide one 's finger down the right side of the touchpad , or across the bottom of the touchpad , respectively . the touchpad 's driver software enable both feature to be tailor to preference , and come with a practice `` game '' to help ensure that one 's preference be just right . the UltraNav TrackPoint come with a third button -lrb- in addition to the standard left - and right-click button -rrb- that can act either as a scroll lock or a magnifying glass . both the touchpad and TrackPoint may be adjust for left-handed use . both be also simultaneously active , but one or both may be deactivate or set to use a subset of they feature . I keep both enable ; I use the touchpad to move around broadly , and the trackpoint to move around and select item more precisely . with Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard , a mouse be no longer need . the downside to the UltraNav keyboard generally revolve around its lineage as a ThinkPad laptop keyboard . like most other laptop keyboard , the UltraNav keyboard have tiny function key , and tiny Insert , Delete , Home , End , pageup and pagedown key . several keyboard function -- include the three volume button , the Fn key , and the blue mechanic -lrb- thinkvantage -rrb- key -- may be render useless for those who do not pair they UltraNav keyboard with a Lenovo computer . Lenovo should have be smart enough to include software to help such user remap all of those non-functional key to do something more useful . this keyboard also lack Windows key -lrb- the Windows key and right-click key -rrb- , and instead have -lrb- previous Page -rrb- and -lrb- next Page -rrb- key . I be not convince of the utility of the latter , because it be just as easy to press   and   to move backwards and forwards in a web browser . the UltraNav keyboard also include two usb 1.1 port ; which be less useful today than when this product be introduce , since many usb device these day can take advantage of higher usb 2 speed . remember to install the UltraNav driver - before - plug in the keyboard into you computer for the first time . Windows Vista 64-bit user should consider use the latest generic driver from synaptic because Lenovo 's Vista 64-bit driver do not support virtual scroll for the touchpad . both the Synaptics and Lenovo driver however , do not support the magnifying glass action for the Trackpoint 's third-button . Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard merit serious consideration from those seek a solid alternative to computer mouse , and can sacrifice a bit of keyboard functionality . hopefully the next version of this keyboard will incorporate with Windows key -lrb- since they be make available in the ThinkPad 60 series keyboard -rrb- , usb2 port , and maybe multi-touch support for the touchpad .
Keyboard	POS	5	I get a new Lenovo Thinkpad x201 with docking station to replace my old corporate rig , and alas there be no place for a serial keyboard -lrb- dinosaur -rrb- , so I need a usb keyboard . this keyboard look like it fit the bill , and since I also already have a nice Logitech wireless keyboard\/mouse setup for my home system , I think I would give this keyboard a try too . it work perfectly , install automatically in Windows 7 . it be very comfortable to type on -lrb- fast -rrb- , and have really nice no-slip rubber foot on the bottom . you literally can not go wrong with this as a good basic keyboard .
Keyboard	NEG	2	buy if you enjoy turn off the numlock key every time you turn on you computer . otherwise you password will fail . the designer make a stupid gaffe with this design . most recent computer have remove numlock setting in the bio . so buy this if you like to remember to do unnecessary task . in other word the keyboard be the opposite of convenient - frustrate to use . enjoy !
Keyboard	NEU	3	I be use this on a Toshiba laptop , and it work as soon as the bluetooth wizard configure the device . the problem be , once I shut off the keyboard , I have to go through it all again . however , window bluetooth manager show the device be connect , but the keyboard do not even transmit a signal . at this point , I have to remove the device from the list device , and re-install it . then it work , just as before . but , I drive a limo and will use it to allow my customer to browse the web for tv and music video . and , thus , I need two . one for they , and one for I up front , in case something happen and I have to fix a problem . so , with the dongle that be in the drawer , they both work fine , at the same time . the bluetooth dongle I have , get confuse or something . but , I can not figure out why neither of they will function , even though they be connect , accord to window . that be a bit of a hassle , have to re-install they , each time they be turn on . but , that be most likely a system problem w\/my laptop and not with the device . I have see comment that the sensitivity of the pad be not all that great , and I find it nearly equal to any mouse . a slight more effort , to get the cursor from one end of the screen to the other ... . if it be not for have to re-install everytime I turn the unit back on , I would have ZERO complaint ... ; - -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	4	I be concern when I order this keyboard that it be not original from Toshiba , but I buy it anyway because of the price . it fit perfectly , be easy to install and work perfectly . the only difference between the original one and this one -lrb- other than the `` l '' key quit on the old one -rrb- be that all the key on the new one be glossy . it really do not bother I , just want to let you know , just in case you care . great product , well package , and easy to install . -lrb- I find installation instruction on the net -rrb- . enjoy a keyboard with a `` l '' key finally .
Keyboard	POS	5	this be one of the few usb to PS\/2 adapter that work with Cybex \/ Avocent KVM switch without skip , multiple entry or lack of power draw from the keyboard PS\/2 input . the cable be thinner than the older version of the same model from IOgear but I have not see any degradation of performance .
Keyboard	POS	4	this work really great on my Mac Book . it be really necessary to prevent those white key from get dirty and to keep out crumbs\/dust . I type so much that six month later , the color on some of the most frequently use key be start to wear off , but it still work fine . it be not so much purple as it be bright pinkish-purple .
Keyboard	POS	4	for 96c and free shipping , this item be a steal ! the texture itself feel really soft and smooth . -lrb- personal preference -rrb- stick on the key , and doesnt slide off . almost Perfect fit . i only wish theyd cut out the white character so the keyboard back light would go pass through they .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I be typing on my new Kensington keyboard right now . it be just fine . the only problem for I be that it have no usb port . my fault for not look closer at the description . I just assume they all have usb nowadays . oh well .
Keyboard	POS	4	after check out the web site try to find out when this product would be available , it arrive ! what a cool look product ! it come in a neoprene case and have a metal look to it .  what I like the most about the product be input address and email . if I would of have this product when I first buy the old Palm pilot year ago , I would of save hour .  the only downside I see to the product be that it be not a `` durable '' keyboard . you have to have it on a flat , hard surface to use -lrb- not on you lap -rrb- . the w-fold do not lock once it be open , so make sure you keep it on a desk when you be use it and do not just pick it up with one hand like you can with you pc keyboard .  if you type memo , email or travel with you Palm , buy this product !
Keyboard	NEG	1	Logitech rep in BestBuy say that this unit would work with all hdtv that have a hdmus port . incorrect . you need to have a hdtv that have the circuitry to accept hdmus version 1.3 or higher .
Keyboard	POS	5	let I say this first of all . if you do not like noisy tactile keyboard this one be not for you . if you have use a IBM model m or one of the old Northgate keyboard you will love this keyboard . I have have computer since the old Heath kit and then buy a Northgate computer with the state of the art Intel processor - a 386dx and with the computer come a Northgate Omni keyboard . I love it . that all that ledt of that old system . Long toss but keep keyboard . the Model S Professional be the keyboard I purchase . it be the one with the letter key . they make one without letter so be sure of what you want . I have have it now for a couple of week now . it have the feedback that I like . you know when you press a key , you hear the key-press as well as feel the positive feedback . it seem to be very well make . it be not ergonomic as there be no wrist rest . it be not a media keyboard but I do not use those feature anyway . I have own a Logitech Wave and k350 keyboard and a Microsoft media keyboard -lrb- 6000 -rrb- . I just do not like the feedback from these membrane keyboard . oh yes it be a wire keyboard with a two port usb hub located on the side . to get the full benefit of the unlimited n-key rollover you need the old style ps2 port and in addition a usb port so that the usb hub on the keyboard will function . very expensive but well worth the price .
Keyboard	NEG	2	not satisfy . very difficult to pair . if you could , it disconnect in a minute . too small , key combination be difficult to use . no amazon , no return !
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use the Logitech Combo mk520 with keyboard and Laser Mouse for a while now , and the operation be so seamless that I generally forget I be operate wireless at all . I have always use wire keyboard and mouse , and of course find the wire restrict - especially when I need to access the rear panel of my pc for any reason . my one previous experiment with a wireless mouse be short-lived , communication be inconsistent and eventually the software\/device crash . no problem here . setup be very smooth . although some prior reviewer note the keyboard touch be either better or worse than they be use to , personally I do not see any difference . I do not use many of the special key or feature . as note by many other , the calculator key be most handy and welcome . the music related function of mute , volume , next\/prior track all operate perfectly . I understand that the f1 - f12 key can be program to perform different function , but frankly I be not that interested . I use this equipment on my home pc , and for my purpose the additional programming be unnecessary . mouse operation be identical to my prior wire mouse . scroll be smooth . I do have to get use to the fact that if I accidentally knock my mouse to the right , since it be not physically connect to anything , it will indeed crash to the floor . it be a bit alarming for the klutzy , especially that one time the case pop up . but it be not overly delicate , and pop the case back down result in no harm , no foul . overall , this be simply a outstanding product in my experience . if anything , I have experience fewer problem with the Logitech wireless combo than I previously have with hardwired keyboard or mouse equipment .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I purchase this keyboard look for a cheap wireless keyboard and touchpad combo . at a distance of around 12-15 foot the response be ify . within range the device work well except for the most annoying thing about it . the device refresh every 30 seconds or so and this be especially irritating when try to watch a movie . it will also slightly move the cursor from time to time which make it worse . sometimes you get what you pay for .
Keyboard	NEU	3	my Targus Stowaway keyboard for Visor Deluxe seem to have die over the weekend after eighteen month . actually , it be a internal conflict within the Visor . I have add a jumper wire inside the Visor so I could charge from my hot synch . cradle after a corresponding modification to the cradle ... my stowaway keyboard work just like before after make this modification . then I download Targus ' lastest version of the driver for the keyboard . a couple of day later the keyboard be completely non-responsive . I have remove the jumper now . I later find the real problem be that my Visor be in its final stage of life . the keyboard do have a nasty habit of cease to communicate with my pda . by experimentation , I learn that a soft reset follow by a warm reset get it go again . the keyboard work well when it work , but too often it do not . again , this be probably more of a problem with the Visor than the keyboard .
Keyboard	NEG	1	this product do not work at all with my system . it do not lay flat , and be very difficult to type on . I have to write a lot for my job , and it be very difficult to use .
Keyboard	POS	5	then you need this keyboard ... take a little get use to but once you master it , you pain will go away over time . also keep other from use you keyboard !!! love this ergonomic product .
Keyboard	POS	5	I receive this product on November 5th 2011 . it be perfect ! it take 4 day to ship for free with super saver shipping . specification : 5.9 x 2.3 x .5 inch -lrb- l x w x h -rrb- , weight : 100g or .22 pound , operational range : 10 meter -lrb- for real ! -rrb- ! pro : small , good range -rrb- 10 ft , back-lit keyboard , small usb receiver that go into keyboard , look exactly like picture -lrb- have same button -rrb- , nearly all button find on laptop keyboard , come with usb splitter ; one side charger and other side female usb -lrb- genius -rrb- , button be easy to press , fair price -lrb- cheapest on internet -rrb- , laser pointer , and great bonus sleep feature . con : none . only thing be that this be make by favus entertainment if that somehow change you decision . if I ever need another wireless keyboard , this be the one I 'll buy for sure ! thanks , pjdsmt
Keyboard	POS	4	I buy this as a backup to my wireless keyboard . I do not want another old keyboard clutter my limited workspace , and this fit the bill . it always work when I need it , and when I do not ; I just roll it up and shove in the back of a desk drawer .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have to order a new keyboard after my original with my iMac succumb to the effect of a cup of coffee . the new one work great . I be very pleased with Apple product .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I brood on buy the virtually indestructible keyboard for several month . all the review I read tell I not to do it , but I do anyway . so why should not you buy this keyboard ? simply put , the key touch response be horrible . you can not fly over the key like you do with a normal keyboard , because they require a lot of pressure to input the letter you be typing . second , the key be lay out strangely . for instance , the spacebar be actually two key instead of one long , thin bar . so if you hit the middle of you spacebar by habit , you thumb will land in-between the two . also , the backspace button be the size of a normal letter key , which make it difficult to reach when touch typing . it be just very poorly design and not useful to anyone who type by touch . however , the illumination be pretty neat , and it do roll up as describe . I be hope it would work out for I so I could wipe it off when I spill a soda or drop a crumb in-between the key ... but this be not my solution , unfortunately . I can only recommend this keyboard to someone who be a `` hunt and peck '' kind of user , since they will probably be able to focus enough pressure on the key that the stiff input will not affect they typing style . for the speed typer , someone who use they computer nearly all day every day , stay far away .
Keyboard	POS	4	I have not use it as much as I could , but it have do exactly what I expect . I connect it to my vizio vtab108 easily . I type something on evernote and on dolphin browser . feel a bit weak but the key respond well .
Keyboard	POS	4	I recently purchase this mk320 wireless keyboard and mouse from Amazon . both be work great and catch the signal from good distance . I try from 5 foot and it be work fine . I would say consider this price -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- , this iteam be worth by .
Keyboard	POS	4	the keyboard sport slick design , unique functionality , and it be the most comfortable keyboard I have ever use -lrb- in 15 year of pc use -rrb- . it be a little buggy when use with a KVM though . it will take some get use to , but once you learn how to work with a ergonomic keyboard , you 'll have a hard time go back to a regular keypad . it be a must-have for my fellow carpel-tunnel survivor !
Keyboard	NEG	1	typical Microsoft nightmare . first the instruction for pair the keyboard to the computer do not clearly state you have to type the passkey number \*\* on the keyboard \*\*\* & PRESS ENTER to PAIR the keyboard with the computer . I spend hour try to get the keyboard to work . what throw I off be the first time I set it up , I do not have to type the passkey on the keyboard . the keyboard and computer drop the connection and when I try to re-install it would not pair with the computer . bring it back to Staples for a replacement . -lrb- too bad I do not find out until too late that my keyboard be function - it be the documentation which do not work . -rrb- get a new keyboard , get it to sync once , then it drop the connection and I could not get the keyboard to broadcast - keep push the bluetooth button to make the keyboard discoverable , but only get a green light and no flash red . then no green light at all . Staples be go to be sick of I try to return the new keyboard for the old one , but this be a disaster . look for a HP or Logitech bluetooth keyboard .
Keyboard	POS	4	although you should be able to use this keyboard with any computer , it be ideal for use with Thinkpad laptop . I have a Thinkpad x series . I spend almost half my time at location where I be directly work on the laptop 's keyboard . but other time , at home and at the office , I have a docking station and a external monitor . with that setup I use this keyboard . since the key placement be almost the same , it be very easy to switch between the laptop and the external keyboard ! however , one thing that I do not like be that although the key be shallow like laptop key , they do not feel the same . they be softer .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I usually do not bother write a review but for this specific item I feel like it be a duty to do it . I be one of those early adopter that buy anything new and never return they regardless of if they suck or not . I be very excite to get that brand spanking new Google tv but what a appointment it have be , the Google tv do not bring anything to the table period , it do not a little of every but very poorly . the build in web browser be useless since you can not install any plug in nor open a new tab , the keyboard do not have a light build in so forget try to use it in a dark room , the app ... well there be pretty much nonexistent , no storage space ... if you goal be to watch a bunch of movie and video on the internet you can just forget about it , the Google tv just will not find anything for you . it be a great idea but fail execution , use it for a week then return it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have have my mouse and keyboard for about a year now , and so far , no problem . I still have the orginal battery in my keyboard . here be a little list of thing that I do not like about the keyboard and mouse : ... . . none . here be a list of what I like about this mouse and keyboard : ... ... . . everything .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I have order this item twice and neither time do I receive the item shown\/described !! instead of receive what you want you will in fact receive a crystal cover with no keyboard cover !!!
Keyboard	POS	5	I be just browse around to see what keyboard be available and I be surprise to see the trusty Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite still on the market . I have be use this keyboard every day for the past eight year and it have not fail I yet . what be especially great about this keyboard be its easy cleaning . after remove the 10-15 screw from the back of the keyboard , the key pop out in three section : left hand , right hand , and number pad . I scrub these with soapy water and a brush and rinse all debris away under the powerful spigot in my bathtub . I let the key section dry for a few hour and reassemble the keyboard . I have be do this every few month for eight year and I have yet to strip any screw or break anything . the last time I clean it , I use a little bit of rub alcohol to remove some of the palm oils which be embed into the plastic palm rest . this keyboard look as good as it do in 2002 , and none of the key have begin to show any wear either ! I have to agree with other reviewer that the arrow key layout be not the best . I remember use the prior model of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard about ten year ago , which have a better design with full-sized arrow key . I be consider order another one of these just to keep it in the closet in case the one I be use to type this review break , although I suspect that this one should last I 10-20 year give its current condition .
Keyboard	POS	5	wow ! I be a -lrb- girl -rrb- gamer and I have be want this for quite some time now and I be thrill . the key be so smooth ! typing be a breeze with this . I love that I can control my speaker with the wheel on the right side without have to go into sound setting or the volume control on the speaker themselves . it make it much easier when it be right there in front of you . I have yet to use the macro as I have be a bit too busy play game to be honest , but I plan to fill they all soon . it will be nice to not have to type all the information now that it be a simple press of a key . my profile disk would not work , but get the dl on Logitech 's web site be no problem . I have be miss out and really glad that I finally get this . it be more than worth the wait !
Keyboard	NEG	1	I like the concept of a keyboard that could dock my ipad2 , sync it , and charge it . too bad Apple do not make one compatible with the ipad 2 .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I do not like this product . the keyboard function do not work consistency . the pointer do not work .
Keyboard	NEG	1	before Gyration Inc. can compete in the Mouse & Keyboard arena , they must learn to design product that be completely in sync with Windows ! I even take extra step in download all driver need from the Gyration Website , but this slick and very design drive package still could not give a `` Ultra Performance '' . the keyboard would sometimes read and sometimes not ... and the mouse would force Windows to crash ! it be too bad , I want it to work . I guess I should stick to the `` Old School Products '' with more experience .
Keyboard	POS	4	I like this keyboard a lot it work well and even though I do not think I would use the extra programmable key I do sometimes . the problem be that I sometimes hit the Back and forward key when it would be better not to . mostly it be my fault but I think the could have be place better . the last Microsoft Natural keyboard I have have a screw up arrow keypad and that be why I buy this one to replace it . I be use to the standard keyboard configuration . I like this keyboard because it be standard for the most part with a few extra . this time they do not change the basic setup they just add to it .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I pick this set up because I want a second one of the keyboard -lrb- which I love , see my review  Logitech k350 2.4 Ghz Wireless Keyboard  ... not . the mouse be full-sized and full-featured . very flexible with the software as far as reprogram the button . however , there be two feature of this mouse that will cause I to either put it in a drawer for emergency replacement or just give it away . 1 . the scroll wheel : I have two other Logitech mouse that I use most of the time : a MX Revolution and a Darkfield Performance MX . both have very fast scroll wheel . once you get use to that , you never want to go back . this mouse be painfully slow in comparison , and , although via the software you can reprogram it to two other scroll mode , both require move the mouse on the desktop rather than just move the scroll wheel . 2 . this be the real deal-breaker : the finish on the top of the mouse be gritty and irritate my palm . I use this mouse for about 4 hour , do normal `` stuff . '' my right hand be back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse , but mostly I be click around the web and my system . at the end of the time , the palm of my hand , in the quadrant under my pinky and toward the heel , be irritated . I could not figure out why . then I compare the finish on the m510 to my other two and realize that the other be MUCH smoother . I check my husband 's stash of sandpaper , and I would say that the m510 have a finish on the top that be just a bit smoother that 600 grit wet or dry sandpaper . apparently I do not settle my hand all the way down on the body of the mouse all the time . part of my hand hover just high enough that it `` brush '' over the surface of the mouse . I never realize that before , but now that I know , I 'll never buy a mouse without a smooth top surface again . if you mousing technique be different from mine , this could be a great mouse for you , but not for I .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I buy this from clearance monster use . it arrive with a note inside state there be no battery and no manual but it do not illuminate so I be highly disappoint ; ok I understand it be use but the paper work inside never say anything about it not work and I feel you folk rip I off besides the fact that when it arrive the inside of the box and some of the contents look like it be throw around and not properly pack NOT HAPPY that I still need to turn on a light at night and be the sole purpose of buying .
Keyboard	POS	5	the first one I receive be doa so I get a refund and order another one . I have have the replacement for about three week and it be great ! the keyboard charge within a couple of hour and it use the apple 30-pin connector so it be very convenient in that respect . I have not do a rigorous battery test on the key but I have use they for a couple of hour straight without a hitch . the key go into sleep mode after a couple minute to save battery and reconect in a second as soon as you strike a key . it conveniently have a switch on the side so when you do not need it you can just turn in off . it have all the key like a regular keyboard . the right shift key be a little weird to hit as well as the delete key , they both take a bit of get use to but not too bad , other than that it be a relatively nice keyboard to type on . I be write the whole review with it . there be also a whole set of very useful function key at the top such as brightne , home button , search , select all , copy , paste , cut , play pause , next track , previous track , volume up and down , mute , and lock . the keyboard be hold on by pretty strong magnet and can be remove if not need . the case be synthetic leather and it feel nice , it have a loop to hold a stylus below where the home button go . the inside surface of the case have a suede feeling . all of the opening for button , mic , speaker and camera be well place and easily accesible . the be one mod I have to do however ; the flap that hold the ipad in place start get some play and the ipad gigle around a bit and I get nervous about it fall out , specially after read a review that it have happen to somebody so I get some velcro with the sticky back and put it on oposite side of where the flap meet the case and problem solve , my ipad be securely in place and I can take it out easily if I need to . with the couple of flaw it have the price more than make up for it , and at $ 35 you can not go wrong and get a great keyboard case for all of you that need to type while on the go .
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy this keyboard\/mouse combo because I need a way to play my computer game that be display via hdmus to my big screen tv . this combo have a huge reach and I have never have a issue with the signal be drop or laggy . I buy these somewhere around 5 month ago and the original battery be still display as full with pretty heavy daily use . never see a mouse like this one , do not have the typical red laser eye for tracking , have no light at all actually , but it literately work on anything include my jeans . Logitech do it again , I be weary of spend this kind of cash on a keyboard and mouse , but I be very happy I do .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I love everything about this keyboard except for one problem when i be typing , at anormal speed , it type a million of eaaaaach letter , like this , i do not od that with the a be in each , the keyboard do . its really annoying , especially when it also go for the backspace . mean that if I be at the end of `` each '' and want to fix those a 's i would press backspace and my enitre sentence would be delete . besides that its great its also constantly behind , by like a full second
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy the Saitek Eclipse II Keyboard as a upgrade from a smaller illuminating keyboard . I really like the feature on this . it be well lay out and very well build . it be get a nice weight and feel to it . the key feel great while typing and actually have a little bit of texture to they . even the character on the key have style . I especially like the glossy black finish to the main board part . the illumination be not terribly bright , but it be enough to find the key in the dark and make it look cool . the color can be change with the press of a button and the intensity of the light can also be adjust . it do not come with direction , but everything be pretty easy to figure out . great keyboard !
Keyboard	NEG	1	the '' \ '' key be located somewhere very uncomfortable -lrb- below `` enter '' -rrb- . as I do a lot of programming and need to type the key pretty often , it be just a painful to use the keyboard . I regret I have not examine the layout of key carefully before purchase it .
Keyboard	POS	4	you can not beat the price on this keyboard skin . I like that it protect the keyboard - it add a barrier from liquid get into my laptop in case of accidental spill , and keep dust and lint from get in between the key . it feel good with its nice rubbery grip , but it do take a little bit of get use to . con : it do not fit perfectly snug so there be a few area on the edge that slightly buckle . the rubbery feel take get use to so at first you typing will slow down because it feel like each key be stick -lrb- even though it be not -rrb- . you can not tell if the cap lock be turn on because it cover the little light . overall I recommend this skin and I actually end up buy another one for my daughter too .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have read up a lot on the black widow from Razer , and I be honestly not so sure I want to buy it after all the bad review and the forum post that people keep say they be have issue with the keyboard , but eventually I choose to take the risk , I mean Amazon have a amazing return policy so if something go wrong I could always return it . anyways the keyboard arrive quickly and I have be use it for roughly a month or two and so far have have none of the problem post by a lot of user . the back light be perfect for work in low light , and I 'll admit the key do clack a little loudly but its not really a problem for I . as other people have mention , yes the font be a little weird at first but it really be not hard to get use to it , or the swap of the number and alternate symbol on they . all in all a very good product that have spoil I , as I refuse to use anything but mechanical anymore !
Keyboard	POS	5	great product and love use it ! I have have it for about 2 month and have not have any technical problem with it .
Keyboard	POS	4	I like this keyboard a lot . it be on a little expensive side , but I think it be worth all the money in term of comfortness . if you be familiar with the layout of a natural keyboard , and if you do not need look down every time you type , you will love the comfortness of this keyboard like myself . the soft padding and the reverse tilting -lrb- bottom side of the keyboard be lift with the stand include -rrb- seem to give I extra mileage every time I use this keyboard . since the last one I use be a Microsoft Bluetooth Elite , it would not be fair for I to rate the responsiveness of this keyboard . I be not a gamer , but I could not stand the jumpy sleep\/wake mechanism of the bluetooth keyboard -lrb- otherwise Bluetooth Elite be a very solid product ... stylish , too -rrb- . finally I decide to go back to a wire one , and I do not seem to have the problem any more . if you be , however , a sniper typist , one-shot-one-type , I see a small problem . with the reverse tilting , probably you will find yourself do extra neck workout , reach out you head to look down every time you type . also if you be not fully familiar with the natural keyboard layout , probably you will sometimes have to look down and you will find that you finger block you view to the letter on the key with the stand attach . sure you can use this keyboard without the stand , but then probably you can find a alternative choice ... something even cheaper maybe ... the keyboard layout be what you can expect from any natural keyboard . however , the extra function key -lrb- favorite , sound on\/off etc. -rrb- layout do not seem quite intuitive , and icon on those key be hard to recognize . as a personal opinion , I wish those icon illuminate for better recognition , if they have to have low contrast against the luminance of the key . there go my 5 star keyboard .
Keyboard	POS	4	the keyboard work excellent all around , the only thing you should be aware of be that some of the non word key be closer to the word than normal keyboard be
Keyboard	POS	4	once you use a color backlighted keyboard you 'll never like any other . if you like to be online in a dark room , it be the best ! the Saitek Eclipse keyboard be durable , survive multiple drop onto hard floor . but the key can become blur as paint wear off . also , the Zippy backlit offer more color combination , more control and be prettier . the Zippy be shiny , piano black with flatter , quieter , more responsive key . the Zippy be more compact , which not everyone will want , but which better suit I . compare for value and feature . I have own 3 Saiteks , but love the Zippy more . zippy bl-741 usb V. 2.0 512 Color Gradation Illuminated Backlight Keyboard be available on Amazon for $ 44.99 + $ 5.99 shipping .
Keyboard	POS	5	this cable be very simple to use and be about $ 45.00 less than the name brand model that do exactly the same thing .
Keyboard	NEU	3	this cover be not a great fit for my keyboard , but it do stay put once you have type on it a bit . it take awhile to get use to , but now that I be , it really have speed up my typing and protect my key from get dirty . it be easy to pop it off and clean it , but then of course it be weird to fit it back on . however , I try typing without it the other day , and it be a very odd feeling , so I guess I have get use to it . the main reason I feel it speed up typing be because you finger will not slide around the key , and with the extra friction you do not have to be as precise . the reason for my rating of 3 be that the blue be considerably lighter than it appear in this picture - much closer to sky blue than to true blue . I would have return it but do not want to deal with the hassle .
Keyboard	POS	5	pro : key have excellent feel and the program key make fly Microsoft FSX much easier con : blacklighting could be a litle brighter on the high setting but still very adequate for fly at night with only ilumination from the monitor ' purchase for the blacklighting and programable key feature and have not disappoint . keyboard dimension w\/o wrist rest 21.5 w x 8.5 deep . I have to re-adjust my pull out plastic keyboard tray to accodomate the depth . my old keyboard be 6.0 deep and I need the new one to clear the desk overhang to allow access to the very top control . I rarely use the top control and could have leave the old tray in its original position . the back lighting be blue and have 2 brightness level along with off and the adjustment key be above the f-12 function key . the wrist rest be easily detach and since I do not type other than email I have not install it as the additional depth would have add another 2-3 inch . it be a great gaming keyboard especially for Flight Sim use
Keyboard	POS	5	work great !! go the best buy way and have to return asap as they key board have a range of 3 foot this unit work great up to 30 foot away from laptop hook to plasma tv
Keyboard	NEG	2	some the key be in wierd place and backspace button be small rather than rectangle a little hard to get use to
Keyboard	POS	5	I read some of the negative review and I be hesitant , but I seem to have get lucky because mine have no problem and this keyboard be amazing . none of my key be touch each other like some older review complain of , and the feel of the keyboard be perfect . I love the feel and the sound of each key click as a I compress it . the speed of my typing instantly rise a substantial amount , while the error I typically make have be reduce . I have use this for typing papers , programming , and gaming . it be great for all three . my reaction time for gaming have increase due to the short actuation point of the mechanical key and I be typing faster and more comfortably when work on homework . I highly recommend this product to anybody consider the purchase - it be completely worth the money . though I would recommend wait for a Friday when Amazon do electronic deal because the keyboard often drop below $ 110 then .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I recently purchase the Logitech Media Keyboard . the numeric key on the right side of keyboard do not work . it come with almost no write instruction -lrb- I would have be satisfy with something print on the box -rrb- . Logitech help do not offer 24 hour \/ seven day a week support . -lrb- they must not have pay they Indian & Russian phone bill ! -rrb- the key imprint look like they be put on with whiteout and they must have be try to save money because they be at least 1\/64th of a inch long . the CIA should buy  Logitech 967740-0403 Internet 350 Vista Qualified Usb Keyboard - black  altogether a complete waste of money and perfectly good cheap plastic !
