Baby	POS	4	the sheep itself be very soft and very cuddly -lrb- i also have the back to sleep bear and the slumber bear by Prince Lionheart and these be not as well make or as attractive to a small baby -rrb- , the white sound -lrb- ocean and rain -rrb- be great and very effective although i prefer the in-utero sound of the slumber bear \/ back to sleep bear as they combine the heartbeat with a swooshy white noise that have be very effective for my daughter -lrb- the heart beat on the larger sleep sheep be very ` thumpy ' not white noise -rrb- . the timer setting be great , 25 min be ideal for my child , and 45 min for a more fussy night - Prince Lionheart go off after 5 min - however the Slumber bear \/ back to sleep bear be sound and movement activate and this be a real winner for I as my baby wake frequently at night and resettle herself when the white noise restart ... the only problem with the sheep be that i would have to go into the nursery to restart it myself and once my daughter see I she get upset when i leave again . the reason we have all 3 be that the first slumber bear we have stop work recently and we need 2 sound box go off at once to settle she because she like she white noise very loud to drown out she brother shriek \/ sleep talk ... I use this to get she to sleep initially and the back to sleep bear for resettle in the night .
Baby	NEU	3	I like everything about it & its a good size the only thing I do not like be that the little white plastic stick that hold the bottle be not strobg there all cheapy . . that be if yuh want to dry glass bottle . if you only use plastic or intend to use it for plastic only then this be for you
Baby	POS	5	love it . Super soft , and great gender neutral color . very easy to take on and off baby . Wish I could get it in a bigger size now that baby be get older .
Baby	POS	5	we begin use the Halo SleepSacks as soon as we son learn to roll over and could not be swaddle anymore . I love the soft , breathable cotton material . I can dress he in pajamas appropriate for the temperature \/ season know he will not be overheate with the cotton sleepsack on top . they be durable and wash well . I be happy that they come in x-large . my son be very tall for he age , but at 13 month he can still comfortably wear a sleepsack to bed . I think they be a safe alternative to blanket and more convenient for the child who toss and turn and would kick a blanket off anyway . as soon as we put on he sleepsack he be know it be bedtime . it be a great signal that end we bedtime routine .
Baby	POS	5	this be a really nice sleep sack . we favorite be a jersey one from the UK . this one be we backup . godd value .
Baby	POS	5	these be great bib ! this be the second one I have purchase already . I probably would not recommend this for baby who be just start solid -lrb- I use the cloth bib -rrb- but these be so great for self-feeder . they be easy to clean too : I either wipe they down with a wet paper towel or I wash they like I would regular dish -lrb- sponge & soap -rrb- for the extra messy meal . no stain so far on either one -lrb- even with spaghetti sauce -rrb- . love these !
Baby	POS	5	buy these for my newborn she have large finger and the gerber newborn mitten be too small . these be large she can open she hand . the material be also very soft and color be neutral
Baby	POS	5	I be so happy that I buy this pump ! I have receive a Avent single electric breast pump for my baby shower , and while I be only use it for occasional pump it be fine . however , once I go back to work , I need to pump more frequently and it take a very long time to pump both breast ... at least a hour for both , longer if I want to be thorough . since I be pump at least 3 time a day , that be much more time than I could spare ! I have research the high end pump , and I be go back and forth between the Medela pump in Style Advanced , Medela Freestyle and the Ameda purely Yours Ultra . since I be live in Europe at the moment , I realize that the Ameda be difficult to find , mean that part and support would be difficult to find as well , so that be out . I really want something hands-free but I do not want to pay so much extra for it , and from the review I have read , the hands-free apparatus can be complicate to use . so I opt for the pump in style and I be really glad I do . it be super fast ! really ! I can empty both breast in less than half a hour , rather twenty minute !!! that time save really add up and I would be happy just with that alone , but there be more positive . the adjustable suction power be great because my breast no longer hurt after pump . with my Avent you could adjust the speed , but not the power -lrb- which be quite strong -rrb- , and I never realize how much my breast have ache afterwards until use the Medela . it be easy to clean and it be much lighter than I expect . people have complain about condensation in the tube , but I just keep the pump on for a few minute with only the tube attach and have not have a problem . it be also much quieter than my old pump , and my little boy sleep soundly next to I while I pump . I also solve the hands-free dilemma by cut hole in a old bra which fit too tight , first position the breast shield , then attach the connector through the hole in the bra . the tight fit be important so the shield do not get displaced as the milk fill container weigh the pump down . that work great and I do not have to spend extra money . I only wish I could get larger storage container , but the 150ml one be the only one available here , mean that I have to stop pump to empty the milk into a larger container . that be the only negative I can think of . I highly recommend this pump , it be worth the money ! I only wish I would have buy it sooner .
Baby	POS	5	I receive this as a baby shower gift from my aunt and I absolutely love it , as do my husband . the music be not loud but it be not suppose to be , it be after all a device to get you baby to go to sleep . I be glad I ignore the bad review about the sound because that turn out to not be a concern of mine at all . it be so easy to assemble , take I 5 minute and it be do . I love the Bach , Beethoven , Mozart and Rainforest sound option - my favorite be definitely the rainforest though , very soothing . the ` fuzzy ' leave open and close and the leaf with the animal attach spin around slowly . this will definitely put any baby to sleep , it be so comforting and soothing . I would give this product 10 star if possible , I love it . it also go perfectly with we jungle theme baby room , it add the final touch to the room and it look perfect . I highly recommend this product to any and everyone .
Baby	POS	5	I have for the past year and I love the Medela pump in Style Advanced . since my son be 3 week old I have be pump exculsively and I highly recommend this pump . I have the model previous to this one , the only difference be the bag . I have travel serveral time in both airplane and car and this pump be great . the car adapter do not work the strongest in all car , however I can always get enough suction with the battery adapter . as with all pump I have have to replace membrane , but I find I could buy they online or locally . the ice pack for the bottle holder do not stay cold enough long enough for I , so I replace it with another longer last ice pack .
Baby	POS	4	the game itself be cute . however , I think the pacifier would already be cut out . they be not . everything come to you print on one sheet . I guess I should have open the box before the day of the shower . I do not , and so with not have enough time to cut they out , we be not able to use it . oh well . my fault I guess . should have inspect it closer when I get it .
Baby	POS	4	I buy two of these seat saver for my Honda Odyssey to accommodate Britax Marathon carseat . yes , the basis be wide , but be not that the point ? the non-slip surface on the underside grip the leather very well and my car seat have no slip and slide when latch in and secure . the front flap be great for keep melting snow and ice and general muck from my kid 's shoe off the front of the seat . I wish I would buy a third for the infant car seat !
Baby	NEG	1	this absolutely do not fit the Chico Keyfit 30 car seat . these car seat do not snap into the frame . do not waste you time purchase ! we have to return .
Baby	POS	4	these be great for when it be too warm for fleece sleeper , but too cold for no blanket . my only complaint be that even with closely follow the care instruction , we XL cotton sack seem to have shrink considerably . it just barely fit my 20-month old length-wise even though she be in the 50th percentile for height . even so , there be a gap in the market for product like this one , so I would consider this one to be a must-have . she will not keep a blanket on herself , so this be we only solution .
Baby	POS	5	I have read the other review and agree that the lid be a pain when up against a wall ; I have not experience a problem with the cushy seat . I have a toddler boy -lrb- tall and slender -rrb- who have be through another Safety First 3-in-1 potty , a large potty insert seat , and the Fisher Price Frog Potty all before my mother purchase this one to try . my son love it ! the first 3-in-1 do not have enough of a lip for pee , the insert seat be not comfortable and have a hard shield , and the frog potty have such straight wall that the pee will spray out front\/back\/sides at any give time . we use this potty downstairs and my son have actually request another one for upstairs . until something just as comfortable and with a cup that prevent spray-out come along , the other issue be not enough to prevent this from be the best potty out there for a little boy .
Baby	POS	5	love these bib for my refluxy baby . she go through several a day . they be a little bit big around the neck , but she be only two month and these be for three month and up .
Baby	POS	5	I agree with all the positive review . this bib be easy to clean and really catch all ! I have hand wash mine and I have not have any problem with it at all . I also dump one in the laundry by accident and it come out fine ! I buy other soft bib with pocket before and they turn moldy when they get wet . the hard pocket bib , like Baby Bjorn be awful . they be too hard and all my baby do be cry and try to rip they off when he have they on .
Baby	POS	5	I recently receive this for my daughter who be 6 month old . I have 2 previous halo sleepsack and love they , but she be outgrow they . the cupcake pattern be adorable ! she love sleep in she sleepsack , and they zip from the top down which make middle of the night diaper change very easy . we love this product !
Baby	POS	5	excellent product . would highly recommend this . my baby do not appear to like be swaddle with a blanket and always manage to kick she way out of it which worry I greatly , the thought of she get tangled in the loose blanket . I no longer have this worry and she seem to get a better sleep with the sleep sack and be warm throughout the night .
Baby	NEG	2	this bib be probably my least favorite and most seldom use . the `` special milk-catching design '' be just bulky under baby 's neck and do nothing to stop drip . the `` waterproof inner layer '' admittedly do save baby from get wet after one bottle malfunction , but it mean the bib feel kind of stiff . I be a lot happier with a thicker material bib instead that feel nice to touch and can be bent and fold as require . I would not recommend this to anyone .
Baby	NEG	1	so so mad because the monitor break after 10 day use . I have to wait another 6 day to get the Medela pump from Amazon to send home . my child have to eat formulum and express milk for 6 day . more stress and more tire for a new mom like I because of the unreliable machine . will not recommend this product .
Baby	POS	5	have be hunting for mitten that could stay on my son 's hand and finally find one . absolutely help when we go out in the cold and not that easy to pull it out ... Love the design and color . unlike other mitten these be soft on baby 's hand and still do not get wet very fast if he be suck . and best part - you can change the color by turn the shaded part the other way !!!
Baby	NEG	1	I hate these bowl . I be go to return they . the lid be super hard to get off and the suction do not work at all ! sometimes I can get the bowl to stick for a matter of seconds , and I can not get they off . then my son reach over and pull they off with no effort at all . if these be wash in the dishwasher and the suction cup be touch anything during the dry cycle , it will become deform and ruin any chance you ever have of it suction . I would not recommend these to anyone .
Baby	NEG	2	I get these lock because I do not want my son pull all the stuff out of the kitchen cabinet all the time . but they would not work with the way we cabinet be build and when I put they in drawer , they be pretty easy to pull off with just the adhesive . and two break when unsuspecting relative give they a tug think something be stick in the drawer\/cabinet . I be impress by the mechanic of how they work , but in the end it be just easier to put the non-child-friendly item out of reach . however , if you have a drill and the time to put they with screw - and you cabinet have the right size lip inside and the drawer be snug , it might really be what you be look for . my advice - get a couple and see if they work before buy into the whole system , which be what I do .
Baby	POS	4	these be pretty good cute and not too expensive . seriously hairclip be too expensive these day , especially consider we lose one almost everyday after daycare .
Baby	POS	5	this teether have work wonder for my daughter ! she never take a pacifier , but love this . she chew all over this thing and we have never have a problem with she choke or gag herself . we try so many different thing to help she with she teething pain , and this seem to be the only thing that really help . I 'll put in it the fridge for about 15 minute to get cool and then its all hers . also , when we first introduce this to she , she reject it for a few day . so do not give up on you little one , give they some time to get use to it . I would just set it on she high chair tray and let she decide what she want to do with it .
Baby	NEG	1	so I be currently take care of my 4th kid so I know a few thing about freezing milk . we have pack a freezer full of milk for 4 kid now over the past several year . Problem with these bag - when dunk a bag of frozen breast milk into hot water to thaw it out - the bag rip - a small hole will inevitably leak out milk . its happen about 70 % of the time out of the last 30 bag I have have to thaw . absolutely ridiculous . how hard can it be to make a milk storage bag ? the plastic need to be thicker .
Baby	POS	5	I use Avent 4 both my kid . it be great ! I recommend it to family n friend and most change to avert and stick with it !
Baby	POS	5	we purchase two pattern and love they both . it go well with we jungle theme . the quality be great , even after several washing it look new . I would recommend this for sure .
Baby	POS	5	my wife and I order these and be extremely happy with the quality of the material and finish . the cover be easy to use even with a newborn who be kick and scream ! the leg gusset really do prevent leak and we son be very comfortable in they . he be a relatively small baby at 6.5 lb but the x-small fit he perfectly and we expect it to last as he grow through 12 lb .
Baby	NEU	3	so far the actual diaper seem to fit well however I order the pattern `` Bubbles '' for my 2 month old and receive a pattern with huge ugly catfish on it -lrb- which be not even one of the pattern list ! -rrb- . they be not even cute & cartoon-ish , they be massive whiskery catfish - the diaper actually gross I out to look at ! I call to complain since it arrive a few day before we be to leave for vacation , and Amazon drop ship I a replacement which arrive 2 day before we be to leave . and of course , it be the catfish again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the sticker Amazon use to catalog say Bubbles , but inside have twice now be wrong . they have since -lrb- finally -rrb- refund I the money , but I need a swim diaper for we vacation , and thanks to Amazon we be out of time & out of luck : -lrb-
Baby	POS	5	my 7 month old grandson be in heaven ... he have two very sharp little bottom tooth and he immediately start chew and pull on this weird little thing . it be very pliable and soft all around and he love chew on the ring as well as the leaf . he do look rather clownish with the big green leaf on either side of he mouth but if he be happy , then I be happy . I buy three , two for we and one for he parent house and I put one in the freezer . my grandson be a big boy and this be a big pacifier , I be not sure if a smaller\/younger infant could handle it . but give it a shot , sometimes all they want to do be chew ...
Baby	NEG	2	I just order this and it be go right back . my 2 year old , be below or average height and pretty skinny too and the bag be still too small . he do not have much leg room width wise either . it be a good light weight sack if you order one size up for you tot . too bad mine be too big for it . i really want to like it . update : i order the merino wool kid 2-4 for my tot and it be PERFECT . pricey but perfect . lot of leg room and it be snuggly warm .
Baby	POS	5	I buy this blanket for we fussy 7 week old daughter and could not believe it - it make swaddle a snap !!! my daughter be a absolute houdinus and could get out of every swaddle blanket we try -lrb- and we be swaddle use Harvey Karp 's method -rrb- - but we try this one and it be the first she could not get out of - so from then on , it be the only swaddle blanket we ever use ! the thing that be so great about it be that not only do it make swaddle a snap but baby can not get out -lrb- or pull fabric up over they face -rrb- . I have buy one for every other friend expect and have always hear great success story ! Worth every penny !
Baby	NEG	2	i have buy several item from luvable friend and i will be honest to say i love they product . but these bib , although cute , be simply too small for we baby which be 5 month when we receive they . also the velcro part be too big and too rough .
Baby	POS	5	nice soft sleep sack that provide just the right amount of warmth for my baby . long length provide enough room for my boy to be comfortable . i would definitely buy it again . the only complaint would be that the color be not as bright brown as picture but more of a greyish brown ... do not really matter that much though
Baby	POS	4	it be very cute and it work well . the only thing be it be a little short . the baby really love it and it go with we theme .
Baby	POS	5	warm and soft . Easy to put on baby . my little one laugh at the zipper when we put it on he and take it off . Roomy enough for he squirmy little leg and do not restrict he sit up when he wake .
Baby	NEG	2	everything else about this spoon I like , except the handle be heavier then the top of the spoon . so everytime you set the spoon down in a dish , it fall 's out . ususally land on to the floor and make 's a mess . would not buy these a again .
Baby	POS	5	I think the sleep sac be a wonderful invention . I get peace of mind and my daughter stay warm all night . I do not have to worry if she kick off she blanket and be cold , I do not worry about a blanket get wrap around she face . all in all I feel really great about the Halo SleepSack . another plus be that it arrive before I expect !
Baby	NEU	3	the picture of this belt on Amazon show pink , white and black stripe , but the version I receive be pink , white and light brown stripe . I email the seller and they offer for I to return it as they do not have a `` black '' version , but that be a hassle . otherwise , the belt seem to be good quality , though the buckle mechanism might be tricky for a toddler to work . we 'll see after she try to use it .
Baby	POS	4	I truly appreciate this playpen since they pay attention to detail but still make sure it be convenient for the mom too . I have c section and this playpen be right for you cause it be not too high for you when you have to bend down to put baby in the playpen . the canopy be something extra that make it look different than other playpen . lot of space to put stuff and diaper storage be useful as well . I really recommend : -rrb- to all mom . very nice playpen and worth all my money i spend .
Baby	NEU	3	these bib be definitely make very cheap . do not expect to last too long . it start fray after the first wash . they be not waterproof as they claim .
Baby	POS	5	as we all know , you be suppose to put you baby to sleep on he back to help prevent sid . the SleepSack be a great product ! it keep baby nice and warm , yet you do not have to worry about a blanket . and there be space down in the bottom for he foot so he be not too restricted . also , the great thing be that it zip from top to bottom , so you do not have a big zipper poke baby in the face .
Baby	POS	5	this be a awesome product . my baby love it from the start . we buy it when he be 2 month & it be very difficult to get he to sleep . he take to it right away . he be 4 month now and love it more than ever . the music be soft and have the perfect volume for he to fall asleep to . the light be just bright enough to light the mobile up so he can see it spin in the dark . it be definitely worth the money . if something happen to this one , I would buy the same one again .
Baby	POS	5	my baby love it . I could not find a single item he like to chew on besides he hand . I be get frustrated . I be so glad I buy this . he love it . he chew on the berry part and the handle . it be perfect size for he to hold . my baby love the pacifier and after I receive this item in the mail I think he might confuse they , but he do not . I be so glad I purchase this item .
Baby	NEU	3	when it be on properly , this cover do not often leak , be a nice color , and fit snuggly . however , by 18-28 lb. , my son be all over velcro like vulture to a carcass and unless the cover be secure under a onesie , and sometimes even then , I will often find the cover and insert down in one pant leg . the velcro do not require a lot of tug to loose , and if a diaper will not stay on , its effectiveness be lose . paired with the price , this cover have become a back-up for I and be a disappointment .
Baby	POS	5	great product , just as describe , make sure you have a really deep spacious change area as it be big , which be not a bad thing . nice and cushy for baby , it come with bolt to bolt it down , which for premy I see no need for , but maybe in the future . I be still think about that , do not know if I want to drill hole in the top of the dresser when it be later go to be use as a toddler dresser . but ... that be say I be very happy with this , glad i do not buy the cheap wal-mart one ... no comparison !!!! I would recommend this to anyone look for a really nice change pad ... and thank you to the seller WOW that be the fstest shipping ... order April 9 , daughter recieve it on the 11th ... she have identical twin girl so it will be get alot of use ...
Baby	POS	4	these wrap be very easy to use with prefold and clean very well in the washer . the only thing I don would like , which be a minor issue , be that the side on the back curl in . this be only a problem if the diaper be not wet or dirty and I just want to change out the prefold . sometimes it will curl in and get dirty . otherwise , I be very happy with these cover .
Baby	NEG	1	after view the picture , I be excite about this baby hat . the pom pom look very cute , and the hat be say to be make of wool . its name also suggest that it be come from Korea . well , after wait for several week , I finally receive a small parcel with the sign `` China Post '' on it . I open it , and there it be . the hat be cover in some white stuff , which I think be some packing fluff at first , but it turn out to be glue fiber . who on earth would glue pom pom on a baby hat ? and glue they so that the glue -lrb- it seem to be the type of glue one would use with a glue gun -rrb- would go through the `` wool '' and actually touch\/scrape the baby 's head ? also , there be nothing here to suggest that it be , indeed , make of wool . I be extremely disappoint in this product and will try to return it , though if I be to pay for return shipping to China , I guess it stay with I . just look at the picture that I take of this hat , and do not bother order it . Update : after contact the company about a refund , I promptly receive they reply with a apology for the low quality of this product , and they refund I money that I pay for the hat -lrb- but not the shipping cost -rrb- .
Baby	POS	5	this sleep nest be perfect for we little one who be too young to pull up she blanket . instead of just kick off a blanket , she stay nice and warm and comfortable in the sleep nest . we love it !
Baby	POS	5	when I be register for my baby shower I see this . it be to cute to take a chance on not get it . so I purchase it myself . it be so cute ! the bunny tail on the back be adorable and there be the cutest little gift tag on it that look like a package of seed . so it would make a great gift to : -rrb-
Baby	POS	4	the boppy be so nice for my newborn to lay on and I could prop he up with it . he love tummy time with it and it work great to have he awake while on it . I know it be a breastfeed pillow but I do not really use it as that very often . I nurse off and on but mostly pump so that be most of it but when I do nurse , it do not seem to help very much with position , etc. . I still think it be a great baby purchase but if you use it simply for nursing , I do not think you will use it much . especially after you get the hang of it , you will not need it anymore . I enjoy this purcahse and would recommend it . great for a 0-6 month old !
Baby	POS	4	these mitten have work out great ! we start use they when we son be around 4 month , and at 5 month they still fit well with room to spare . we do not put they in the dryer , to prevent any shrink issue , so I can not comment on how they would hold up there . the velcro be fantastic at keep the mitten on he hand - he tend to slip right out of other mitten . they look big enough for he to continue wear until he outgrow he scratch issue !
Baby	NEG	1	I wish I have not spend money on these . they be cheap and do not hold up . please save yourself the frustration and buy higher quality bib . these only get 2-3 use . there be nothing water resistant about these .
Baby	POS	5	this outfit be quite a hit at the baby shower ! yes , it a bit large ... but , that be ok ! better too large than too small .
Baby	NEG	2	this come unwrapped in a big Amazon box with other item I order -lrb- book , toy , etc. . . -rrb- unlike the other item the bib be not wrap in plastic or paper to protect it , and it arrive with scratch and scuff mark . in addition , the edge have extra material hang off . I have see this product in physical store , so I will pay a few $ more for one that look new .
Baby	NEU	3	the bib be great to coordinate with you little one outfit , but they be poor in quality . I would not purchase again .
Baby	POS	5	I buy this for my daughter when she be around 6 month old , and she have sleep with it every night since then . it be small , lightweight , and the perfect size for she little hand . besides be about the cutest thing in the world when you see it tuck underneath she arm while she be sleep , it have also save my hair during nursing session . I always have Sweet Pea available when I nurse , and now instead of pull my hair or scratch my face she hand be busy hold and explore she baby . I do like have the outer pea pod for when we travel or take the baby somewhere because it keep the baby cleaner . my daughter be now 11 month old , and she be so attach to she Sweet Pea , that we buy a second one just in case we need a back-up !
Baby	POS	5	my husband and I purchase this item when my daughter be 8 month . we get it to make do daily thing a little easier without worry about she bump she head . we love it . we only use it for a short time a few time a day and it be great ! it make it easier to make dinner . I plop she in it in the kitchen and we hang out while I be cooking . it make it easy to answer the door and not worry while my back be turn for a few seconds . she enjoy it a lot . we put some snack in it and she eat they and play away . I do not know how we do without it !
Baby	POS	5	I have wash they so many time already and they be still in great shape , and they keep the moisture away from my dd chest and cloth .
Baby	POS	5	this teething ring work wonderful it be right at the child level when be hold child gravitate towards it . fit in child 's hand well . it be beautiful and I get lot of commplement on it people do not know it be a teething ring .
Baby	POS	5	we swaddle we baby from birth to about 3 month . he begin to associate the blanket with nap time or bedtime . when he begin roll over , we need a non-swaddling blanket option that would give he the same sleep cue . the HALO sleepsack work great . it be soft and roomy , but we do not worry about he end up with the blanket over he face or in he mouth . the zipper open up from the bottom , which mean there be no uncomfortable zipper up by he chest . there be plenty of grow room -- he be now 7 mo , and still fit in the sleep sack with room to spare . the tag on the back be scratchy , but that can easily be take out .
Baby	NEU	3	I usually love this brand of cover , but for some reason it seen like this one leak right from the beging .
Baby	POS	4	so we just go through colic and the dreaded 4 month sleep regression phase . when we move we baby to she own room around 3 month , we put a floor fan in there for white noise . she wall be right next to we tv room , she brother be next door and a loud 2 year old , and she big window be right on a busy street . and she be never a really good sleeper . while for some baby -lrb- lucky lucky parent -rrb- a sleep machine be all you need - for we we know it be just a stress-reliever for we , so that we would not have to worry that noise be interfere with she sleep . -lrb- we could tick that item off the list and move on . -rrb- the fan be just way too cold . so I purchase the sound machine -lrb- marpac 980a , see other review -rrb- and this sheep . I get this sheep for the car actually , as one other reviewer have mention it help they baby not scream in the carseat . after look at both -lrb- the marpac and the sheep -rrb- - the marpac end up in she room for consistent white noise all night , and the sheep go in the car . I do not want to worry that the timer function be the reason for poor sleep -lrb- ie when she wake up at night , she can not go back to sleep because the sheep be no longer on - tick another thing off the list ! -rrb- the sheep be really soft . unfortunately , the sheep do not keep she from scream in the car seat . however - it be great for I ! it be now in we bedroom , hang next to the bed - and it have be fantastic for I - as sleep deprive as I have be , it be often really hard for I to get back to sleep after get up to feed or tend to she or my son if he be sick and really need I in the middle of the night . have try muscle relaxation , all that other stuff that I usually do not need , but it would not work . have use a sound machine in the past -lrb- not the marpac -rrb- and hate it . the one I have try before all sound tinny or annoyingly inconsistent . the rain setting on this sheep , and the timer be perfect for I - have no trouble fall back to sleep at any time . thank you sleep sheep !!!!!!!
Baby	POS	5	I love , love , love the Summer Infant Bibbity . it catch the mess and be dishwasher safe . I rinse it off during the day and toss it in the dishwasher in the evening . no muss , no fuss . buy it , you 'll like it .
Baby	POS	4	this bib be a good product . keep baby clean from chin to wrist plus , he love the sound it make !!
Baby	NEG	1	I buy this pump because the hospital say it be a great brand to buy . I be ready to throw it out the window . it start out you set you speed which be fine , but then part way through pump it will change the setting on you to either way to hard and it hurt very much , my nipple have come away raw from this dang machine , or it will go too light to the point where no milk even come out . it also do not pump both side equally . it will do the side that I put the main pump on -lrb- the one that you set it with -rrb- really good but then the other side wont hardly do it at all . I can be at 3 ounce on the one side and only have like 1\/2 a ounce on the other . I would never buy this stupid machine again . it be not worth the money !!!! by the way this be Jared 's wife : -rrb-
Baby	POS	5	I have the chalk mat by this company , so I try this apron . another great product that be smart , practical , and beautiful . Easy to wipe down and I do not have to fight with my kid to get they to wear it . another great gift option . we use they for art and craft to cooking to play in the sink with rubber ducky . and of course , it be eco-friendly so totally safe for my kid and the environment .
Baby	NEU	3	the costume be make with nice material . the only downside to it be that the head piece be extremely small . it would fit a baby under 12 lb . I have to have it alter in order for it to fit and unfortunately its still pretty small .
Baby	NEG	1	I have buy 2 of these bib , and have only have a problem with the polka dot pattern one . the instruction say they be machine washable , but the print start come off after I hand wash it with regular dishwashing detergent . then , the wash machine take the rest of the color off the bib . it be effective at keep the baby clean and I be always surprise at how much food be catch in the front pocket , but , for the price , I would expect it to stay look new as well . I have have it replace twice now , and will just get a refund this time . this do not happen with the flower pattern .
Baby	POS	5	these be amazing ! they stay on every second of the day ! I have be wash they every day so we can use they !
Baby	NEG	1	these be def . the worst burp pad I have ever come across . for starter , they be tiny -lrb- not to mention that they also shrink ! -rrb- . secondly , after one wash only , they look as if they have be use a million time . the material be horrible - rough , fade and not smooth - I can not even let my baby put he head over these thing . in all , this be a waste of money and I would stay clear of they .
Baby	POS	5	buy this for we 5 mo old daughter and she love it too ! she even sit in it just to play with a rattle or watch a show . like most child she have a lot of thing and at time we living room look as if she be the only one who live here . so this product be able to store away be excellent and it be safe , roomy and very cute ! not to mention ... the price be excellent too ! really worth the buy ! happy parenting !
Baby	POS	5	definitely worth the inexpensive dollar it cost . help keep carseat in place , as well as protect the seat -- a major bonus . I end up order more for relative ' car !
Baby	POS	4	good price , clean easily , fold and store easily . the tray do not have a lip high enugh to stop food from hit the floor but we just use it as a booster for my 1 and 2 year old .
Baby	POS	4	it have help my son sleep better thru the night and the sound be very soothing .
Baby	POS	4	I like these because my son just pull off the velcro one , but the head hole be really big , so the collar of he shirt can still get dirty easily .
Baby	POS	4	this outfit will shrink some if it be not wash carefully ; so head up on that . other than that ... I know my baby will look completely adorable .
Baby	POS	5	I use it at home and outside . it be somewhat flexible , so I can roll up and stuff it inside my baby 's lunch box . it catch most solid and liquid -lrb- soup -rrb- . but , I have to take it off when my baby want to drink water or milk so that he can place he arm comfortably .
Baby	POS	4	this a very cute pack n ' Play and be very functional and sturdy . it have everything you need to create a mini baby station for change and nap . the only reason I do not give it 4 star be that the change table seem to roll baby a little to one side . it do not seem dangerous , just a little annoying . the nice thing about the change table be that it fold away and be tall -lrb- easier for tall folk to change diaper -rrb- . we find we really do not use the changer as we have a seperate change area that work better for we at home but it would be a nice feature to travel with .
Baby	POS	5	I pick this sleeved bib because it be reasonably price . I already own a bib with sleeve so I know what a great idea this product be and well worth the money . I be curious about how this brand would hold up to the standard . the two bib be well make and large enough to last through toddlerhood . best price for the quality ... worth get !
Baby	POS	4	my 6 month old son seem to enjoy eat with the spoon . he be not of the age to hold they himself and I worry that they may be too heavy and long , but in the meantime he enjoy the color and the tip do not hurt he gum .
Baby	POS	5	I have give Sophie Giraffe as a gift to two different young mother . my granddaughter be impressed that I know about Sophie G. it seem Sophie G be popular among she young mother friend . my granddaughter say that she son , my great grandson , love the toy and he four year old sister like it too . my husband and I be the godparent to my husband 's niece 's daughter who be now marry and just have a baby girl . mother and baby girl be please with Sophie G and Chan Blue . the giraffe toy remind I of my own daughter 's love of a giraffe toy when she be a infant . I recall how easily she hold onto and maneuver the giraffe in she hand bring the toy to she mouth . yes , I do have to keep wash the toy down .
Baby	NEG	2	these be not soft . . also they do not soak properly ... I will not buy these again ... I realize later that since most part of the bib be embroidered , it be not functional as bib as the embroidered part do not soak well . .
Baby	POS	5	this item ship a little slow but be exactly what I want ! the shelf be nice and roomy for storage . the wood be in great condition and I like the wheel . very good look at a great price . if you be look for something moderate then this change table will be perfect !
Baby	POS	5	we little one look very cute with this bib , and we do not have to deal with the stain anymore . we love it !!
Baby	POS	4	I love this sleep sack . I like how large the size be -- great for older baby . the only thing that keep I from give it a 5 star rating be the zipper . I have 2 and both zipper be not the best quality . with that be say , I would still buy another and recommend the product to someone .
Baby	POS	5	I have be use this pump for the past 5 month since I go back to work . the pump work wonderfully . I use it 2 to 3 time a day . Medela also have great customer service !
Baby	NEG	2	I buy these because I want something that look fun and kiddie and they be . just do not expect something big . these be more comparable to face towel and the stitch on the edge could be better . a lot of extra thread that I have to trim . because it be pretty small we use it more as bib when feed we daughter .
Baby	POS	5	I be a mother with 3 young child . my youngest be 8 month old and grab the spoon while I feed he mushy baby food . even though he always wear a bib , he clothes usually still get dirty . I wonder if any bib would actually keep he clothes clean . I have compare the Bumkins Superbib , the Babybjorn bib , the Bibbity bib , and the Bumkins Sleeved bib . with my first child , I quickly realize that use cloth bib and put they in the laundry after each meal be a terrible idea . they would get moldy and I have to own a dozen bib . then I switch to Bumkins Superbibs . they be very easy to use . I just wash they in the sink after meal and hang they on my bib dry rack . the bib be dry and ready to use again by the next meal . Bumkins Superbibs be lightweight and my baby never mind wear they . since the pocket be soft , they do not work well if the bib have be keep flat in a drawer . I always keep my superbib hang upside down by the pocket on the bib dry rack . so , the pocket dry in the open position and work better . my 3 year old daughter love to wear she Bumkins Superbibs and they be great for she but they do not adequately protect my baby who fling oatmeal . both the BabyBjorn and the Bibbity bib be SMALLER than the Bumkins Superbibs . the Babybjorn bib be make of hard plastic -lrb- like a cup -rrb- . it say `` soft '' in the description but that be just nonsense . the bibbity bib be softer , like rubber . the Babybjorn bib be difficult to put on the baby because it be so hard . even the neck strap be make of stiff plastic . I have great difficulty adjust the neck hole because it keep hurt my son 's neck . I never could get the hole small enough to keep food from escape onto the clothes below he chin . plan on baby cry the entire time you be fiddle with this bib . the pocket of the bjorn bib be great and always stay open . however , because the pocket be so rigid , it clash with the tray . my son sit on a chair that clip onto the countertop . the bjorn bib pocket keep get catch under the countertop and then it would yank my son 's neck . he really hate wear this bib . the BabyBjorn bib be super easy to wash in the sink . it be easy to dry with a towel so you do not need a bib dry rack with this bib . the bibbity bib be much better than the BabyBjorn bib . it be softer and feel like rubber . it be awkward to put on at first and my son be mad . however , he get use to it . I be able to get the neck hole small enough to keep most of the oatmeal out without hurt my son 's neck . the pocket stay open pretty well . the pocket do work better than the Bumkins Superbib pocket . the bibbity bib be about 1 inch shorter than the Bjorn bib and be 2.5 inch shorter than the Bumkins Superbib . so , some food still end up on the child 's lap . the bibbity bib be very easy to wash in the sink and dry with a towel . I think the bibbity bib work a little better than the Bumkins Superbib overall because the pocket catch more . however , my 3 year old daughter refuse to wear the bibbity bib , and say it hurt she neck . she love to wear she Bumkins Superbibs . UPDATE : now my son be 13 month old and refuse to wear the bibbity bib at all . it be too heavy and uncomfortable . unfortunately , all 3 of these bib leave way too much food spill on my 8 month old 's clothes . if you have a baby who eat mushy baby food and grab the spoon , a regular bib just do not give adequate protection . so , I buy the Bumkins sleeve bib . it be great ! it cover everything , even he lap ! he could feed himself oatmeal and he clothes be very clean afterward ! the sleeved bib be very easy to clean too . I just wash it off in the kitchen sink and hang it on my bib dry rack -lrb- which sit next to my kitchen sink -rrb- . the sleeved bib go from drip wet to completely dry in 2 hour . since , the bib dry fast , I use the same sleeved bib at each meal . this way I only have to buy one . in conclusion , I recommend the Bumkins sleeve bib for any baby who eat pureed food . when they start on finger food and become a little neater , the Bumkins Superbibs and the Bibbity bib be good . the bibbity work a little better than the Bumkins Superbib but you child might think they be uncomfortable . I do not recommend the Babybjorn bib . sorry , Babybjorn . I love to wear my baby in you carrier : -rrb- UPDATE : my son be now 13 month old . he refuse to wear the bibbity bib at all . he also pull off he Bumkins Superbibs , throw they on the floor , and laugh . I put he in the Bumkins sleeve bib for every meal . he do not mind wear it and he can not get it off . it also do the best job of keep he clean . I wash it in the sink after meal and hang it on the bib dry rack . it dry in about 2 hour . I use the same bib all the time . I put it in the laundry every few day . here be a link to the dry rack I be talk about  Mommy genius dry rack -- Dry or Display just about anything -lrb- Baby Bibs , Plastic or Reusable Food Storage Bags , kitchen Dish Towels , Bathroom Hand Towels , Washcloths , Mugs , Sports Water Bottles , Herbs , Mittens , Children 's Boots , Lingerie , Holiday Orname ...
Baby	POS	5	I absolutely love this dress table . although I would have prefer something with drawer -lrb- which I would get when my baby be older -rrb- , this come in handy and do a good job of keep mommy organize . the change pad be thin , but it do not bother I or the baby . of all the baby item I plan to give away , this be one that I would be keep .
Baby	POS	5	they match my nojo butterfly ensemble that be my nursery theme . Super absorbent . Modern and chic baby look . I love polka dot for girl so this be too cute . they look expensive but be a great price .
Baby	NEG	1	this bib be WAY rougher than it look ... almost feel like someone go over the fabric with a knife and make it shabby ... in the picture it look like it be a sort of spandex or wetsuit fabric which be what i be expect . for the price , i wouldnt recommend to anyone . im return this on Monday
Baby	POS	4	this be a tough decision for I . I absolutely love the color and design of this outfit ; however , the material be a bit thin . so ... 5 star for the adorable factor and 3 star for material grade . overall score ... 4 Stars . I opt to hang dry this one . if I do throw it into the dryer , I will turn inside out and dry on lowest temperature to preserve the bright color .
Baby	POS	5	Minor Cons : - slightly time-consuming to wash multiple piece . - bottle always leak for I , I personally have to use another brand for feeding -lrb- Tommee Tippee be exceptional for combine breast and bottle -rrb- . - the bottle-pump be top-heavy and fall over if you be not careful , and can leak a little when on they side . - a little milk get under the ` petal ' and can occasionally be slightly messy . pro : - Super comfortable !!!! - Super fast ! - Super suction -lrb- but you 'll hardly feel it -rrb- ! easily compare to the hospital grade pump I use , but without the discomfort . - infinite personalized variety in speed , rhythm , and suction intensity . I can change the variable as often as I want throughout the pump session so that it remain comfortable and can be match to the change of my flow . - double my output in half the time over my manual pump . - the \* only \* pump I would ever want to use multiple time daily . it be just so entirely comfortable and fast . the other pump -lrb- even the hospital one -rrb- make I slightly sore and make pump a burden , especially the more frequently I use they . - one reviewer say it do not work with very large nipple . I have find this to be untrue , you just have to be more careful with the placement and wet you breast first with a little milk to make it easier for they to slide into the funnel . but it do work .
Baby	POS	5	I wait a really long time to buy this because it feel like a lot of money to pay for a smock . I regret wait at all . it make feed time infinitely easier - I do not have to completely strip down my toddler anymore or spend hour try to clean out stain . it be long enough to cover he lap beyond the highchair tray -lrb- if you do not use a tray , part of the leg will still be expose for spill -rrb- . the neck be high enough to cover he collar which use to get hit even with a bib . it be really easy to clean , and I be no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy , stain food ! it be completely worth it and I wish I would have it since he start solid . later edit : we have now have this smock for about 2 year and it be barely show sign of wear . I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meal . the best way to get it clean be to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair . it will dry extremely fast and get really clean . if you do not turn it inside out , the sleeve have a hard time dry on the inside where the absorbent fabric be . we love this smock and just order a second one for my daughter .
Baby	POS	4	the Gerber mitten you find in the store be too short and the wrist be too big . these give my son freedom to move he finger but do not fall off like the other . the wrist size be perfect and the fabric softness and thickness be great . my only complaint be that for something so simple and easy to make , they be not finish well . the serger string where just hang out . I tuck they in myself , fear that otherwise they could unravel . anyone with a serger could easily make these , but with a baby and another child keep I busy , I do not want to take the time -lrb- especially at this price point -rrb- . oh , and one of my bow fall off the first time they be worn , so we 'll see how they hold up .
Baby	NEU	3	the only reason I be give this product 3 star be for the simple face that it be cute & unique . however , the material its make out of should have be advertise differently . I expect it to be harder , like a teether usually be . this teether feel like a generic dog toy that you can pick up at some dollar store . we buy they for we dog all of the time b\/c he actually enjoy tear they up & its easy for he & cheap for we . when I open the package I be greatly disappointed . plus it have a squeaker ! even worse when it be just like the toy you buy you pet . we dog be so excited & I be afraid when we daughter start to use this it 'll become a dog toy the second she drop it ! it cost way to much for what it actually be . so do the other teether sell by this company . they be all cute over price dog toy . : -lrb-
Baby	NEG	1	absolutely awful ! I buy these because I could not find anymore at the store . I love the design ; it be cute and not full of today awful cartoon character . I even think it be nice that I get 8 bib instead of 6 . after one wash , 4 of the bib be rip at the neck line . and 1 completely destroy . I never even get to use they . I be highly disappointed !!
