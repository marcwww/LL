Vacuum	POS	5	I try 3 other brand return two and keep this one . the reason be it have more power and you can do at least 2000 sq with the thing versus the competition . I highly suggest it !
Vacuum	POS	5	I love this vaccuum cleaner , i buy it fro my honda odyssey & it work perfectly as i want . great product highly recommend .
Vacuum	POS	4	vacuum be excellent . a little on the heavy side like the other review say but a excellent value and plenty of suction . make you carpet stand right up . fast shipping and delivery make this a great transaction . excellent seller . would highly recommend both the vacuum and the seller . thanks
Vacuum	POS	5	amazing cleaning power - and I be pretty picky about cleaning -lrb- ask my better 1\/2 -rrb- . great vac for the price . suck up dirt that we previous vac never do . easy to clean filter - dry pretty quick . kid love to see the dirt after dad vac . very light and easy to drive . purchase after read review in lead consumer magazine - they be right . no reason to spend 4 or 5x this much on ANY vac .
Vacuum	POS	4	okay , first off , I be go to address the consistent note I have see in all the 1-star review of this vacuum . those folk all say that there be no suction power in this vacuum . nothing could be farther from the truth !! this little guy be actually lift my rear-seat floormat off the floor ! if that be not suction power , I do not know what be . the unit fold up nice and compact and fit with all its accessory into a nice black bag that go almost unnoticed in my trunk . on the subject of accessory , there be a couple of brush , a hose , and a adapter for the hose . if you have pet hair that have weave itself into you car 's cloth upholstery , you will need to use the brush attachment to get the hair out . that would seem to be common sense , but again , look at the negative review , I think some folk expect a 12-volt vacuum to just lift it out on its own . \* shrug \* it be very easy to clean , too , and it have a handle to turn to agitate the filter inside to keep it suck up detritus when the receptacle be \* almost \* -lrb- but not quite -rrb- full . empty the vacuum be a breeze , too ! the only reason I be not give this a 5-star review be because the 12-volt adapter sit very loosely in the 12-volt outlet in my car -lrb- all three of they -rrb- . I drive a american car . the 12-volt outlet have be standardized for some time , now . so , it be a little frustrating to have to play with the plug until I find where it will sit and not randomly become disconnect from the power , even though it look like it be still plug firmly in . all in all , though , a very good vacuum , and I would highly recommend it !
Vacuum	POS	4	great vacuum . do a good job cleaning and stand up to abuse very well . outlast and outperform other similarly price vacuum . great\/cheap vacuum that you can use for a long time , then replace when it finally die .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I agree with some of the other review about the product be make cheap . I think it do a great job on my carpet , but in just a few month , the foot pedal start pop off everytime I use it . without the foot pedal , the vacuum will not stay upright without fall over . I think this could be a great product with some minor change in the design , but I would be hesitant to buy this again . I have only have mine a year , and I be already look to buy a new vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	this vacuum be horrible . the battery life be about 5 minute and it take a long time to charge . it also do not suck good ! it be the biggest waste of money ever . this vacuum do not even deserve 1 star !
Vacuum	POS	5	order from Amazon , free shipping over $ 25.00 and the best price on the web . better yet i receive it the next day . I could not be happier .
Vacuum	POS	4	wow ! the suction be great on this vacuum and I love the minus attachment , it work great on stair . great price too . it be a great vacuum !
Vacuum	POS	5	I already own one Eureka Boss sweeper and decide to purchase another one so I could have one upstairs and one downstairs . I have a Kirby sweeper and wind up hate it . the Eureka Boss have powerful suction , and have the hose and attachment on board ready to go be wonderful . I have asthma , and my doctor also recommend it .
Vacuum	POS	5	the product meet the advertised claim . very handy on hard floor . a bit heavy but very manageable . really get under the bed easily and kill the huge dust bunny that live there . clean out easily . I would buy another without hesitation . would be very handy in a rv since it store compactly in the include charge stand and be powerful enough for light clean up on the carpet area .
Vacuum	POS	5	pricey . but worth it ! best vacuum I have ever own . quiet . Great for clean both wood and carpet floor , furniture , curtain . Easy to handle . it be pick up ton of cat hair and debris my other well-rated vacuum be miss . I love it !
Vacuum	POS	4	I take away a star due to not receive the advertised ` scent tablet ' which be the minor value add that lead I to pick this particular seller . however the bag themselves be fine . they have the cardboard collar as oppose to plastic , but it work . I have also try Filtrete , Crucial , Green label , etc. . they all work fine . in fact in 10 year of Miele ownership , I have only ever have 2 bag fail and they be both official Miele brand bag . as I have read on other review for the various bag , I agree it be hard to say if they all actually filter as much dust as Miele -lrb- or maybe even more -rrb- but I will say that I do not notice any residual dust inside the bag chamber regardless of which bag I have use -lrb- other the two previously mention Miele brand bag that fail -rrb- . base on all of this , in my experience , there be no reason to pay for the expensive , price-controlled Miele brand bag . the machine be expensive enough in the first place , and replacement part cost a arm and a leg . so save money on the bag !
Vacuum	NEG	2	after research consumer report , I buy the above captioned vacuum cleaner instead of buy another Hoover to replace my twenty-one year old machine . the Eureka come without its tool or wand . the yellow switch that be suppose to toggle between floor and carpet just flop , unattached to anything . the vacuum do a good job on the carpet , but I only have one carpeted room . it do not pick up anything from the bare floor , include Cherrios , rug fuzz which it throw off the carpet onto the floor , kitty litter or dust . and , yes , I do switch the indicator -lrb- not the yellow switch -rrb- from carpet to floor as the Eureka customer service rep. ask I . it be heavy -- on my scale , 23 pound , without the box . if I still have say box , I would return it this minute . I have not be able to try the hose attachment since the promise wand and tool have not arrive . I would not recommend this product to anyone .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have a older portapower-hoover and I recently buy a new one . it be great and the only thing I do not like about it be the new hose because it be too short and low quality . the old hose be longer and make well and I do not use the new one at all , my wife & I clean house so we use the Hoover constantly it be light and durable . Hoover should have keep the old hose . J.H.
Vacuum	NEG	1	I wish there be a no star option . we buy we boss about 10 month ago for light cleaning between the housekeeper come out . my wife complain after a week that it keep shut itself off so I take it apart and clean all the filter . I run it for a few minute and tell she it be fine now - do not think much of it . a week later she report the power paw stop work . a week after that she report the vacuum be shut itself off again . I clean all the filter -lrb- again -rrb- and give it back to she . the filter be not dirty , but I clean they anyway since it do the trick the last time . she say it be a pain and stop use the vacuum alltogether - go back to she old stick vacuum . fast forward several month - we now have a dog and it be time to break out the boss again . this time I take control -lrb- convinced my wife be do something wrong -rrb- . after apologize to she for think she be wrong , and apologize again for not return the vacuum while it be still under warranty I be now on a quest to buy a new vacuum . I be glad to read so many positive review - let 's see how those vacuum hold up after a few month of `` light housework '' . junk - very disappointed - very . I guess in some case you really do get what you pay for .
Vacuum	POS	4	I buy this little vacuum for my brand new car , and I have be quite pleased with it . a lot of people on here be compare the suction power to something more powerful , like a Shop-Vac , and that be a little unfair -lrb- this thing be only use a 12volt power source after all -rrb- . also , you be suppose to free up the vacuum 's filter every once and awhile by turn the dial on the side of the unit , and that help tremendously . this be great for people who simply want to keep they car clean - it be not mean for heavy-duty application .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have own this vacuum for a few year and I have find it to be the absolute best cordless vacuum . it hold its charge , it do not get clog -lrb- provide you clean out the filter regularly , and it have a good power level that allow I to do spot cleaning . we have adult child , grandchild , pet that shed , and even some messy adult in we household -- and this vacuum be perfect for clean up after they without have to lug out the big vacuum . I like this product so much that I just buy two more for my kid who be in college . in previous year they bring other version of cordless vacuum to they dorm , but they never last . I be confident that this little vaccum will do the job and even return home with they in May .
Vacuum	POS	5	after have go through a Oreck , a Hoover and a Dyson , I finally have a vacuum cleaner that have quality construction and control . I love the `` twist '' part , it make get into corner very easy . the hose be very easy to use -lrb- especially in comparison to the Dyson -rrb- . I be a little old lady with a very bad back . I have no problem use my Miele . it do a great job on get up pet hair and in this house a vacuum cleaner have to handle pet hair from two cat and two dog . I actually enjoy vacuum with my `` twist '' , my house have not be this clean in year . Revision I should have wait a while before write the review . the twist go through one bag perform well . it go downhill from there . I can not go over more than two square yard without a blockage . unstop this thing be ridiculous . there be three area where one can try , but it be virtually impossible to get a wire into the hole . trip to the repair shop be a inconvenience , but have to be do . I be very disappoint in this vacuum cleaner , wish I never buy it . 0
Vacuum	NEG	1	I have have this vacuum for about 1 year . I be look for a new one currently . I have have to purchase a new belt every month . I just eat they up . it wasnt bad at first but over time it have get progressively worse . this month alone I have go through 4 belt . I get so frustrated yesterday I just throw it in the trash .
Vacuum	POS	4	buy this product primarily for clean the car and small accident and job around the house . the cordless feature be a definite plus when do the car and quick job like vacuum a hard to reach corner , edge or books\/bookcases . it do a nice job of a dust off a bookcase that have not be clean in several month , but I find that empty the dust from the bin be not quite a open and shake operation . a bunch of the dust clump in the back of the collector bin filter do not empty out until I remove the filter and use a small brush to help it empty out . the vacuum be extremely portable and -lrb- for I -rrb- have a rather loud whinning motor noise . but I guess this be to be expect with a small vacuum with expose exhaust . Trumps the dustbuster I previously own with more suction and a hose feature .
Vacuum	NEU	3	its a great vacuum . although cord constantly come out of the volt socket . its a little lose and you have to be careful . other than that , its a great vacuum . do the job well .
Vacuum	NEG	1	it get hang up on everything , even where the floorboard be slightly uneven . it pick up mainly with the cleaning paper but I can not find much in the vacuum repository . sometimes it get in the middle of the room and stop for the longest time then start go in circle , all about the same size . I be not too happy with it
Vacuum	POS	4	the hose be pretty short and I always tip over the vac when get corner or window . it be on the loud side too . otherwise great and the heap filter be a must for kid and city with lead paint !!
Vacuum	NEU	3	I purchase my Carpet pro Cpu-lt February , 2011 . love it -- not too heavy and it do the job . it quit work in September , 2012 . I have never own a vacuum with such a short life , and I only vacuum about once a week . I be really disappointed .
Vacuum	POS	4	great vac for the price and power . could use a none strechable hose and better wasy of attach the cord . have a funny burnt smell when in use !
Vacuum	NEG	1	I wish I have listen to the bad review on here before I buy , especially consider what a pain it be to return a vacuum cleaner by mail . the first time I use it be ok . I be disappoint with the power , have to go over the carpet in the same place a couple time before it get everything . the 2nd time I use it , the attachment hose stop work . it be not block , it simply be not suck , and have not ever since . also , the bagless design be awful . it be near impossible to clean without make a mess . I be use to bagless vacuum and the extra work it involve , but this be just non-functunal . do not buy it .
Vacuum	POS	5	the Hoover Commercial Portapower Vac : I love this vac . I have shoulder problem and can not push a big vac . the suction on this be fantastic , the industrial cord super long . the reusable bag - very sturdy but the absolute best part be the click in component -lrb- not to downplay the suction -rrb- . the hose stay together . this be replace a Hoover windtunnel and a Eureka Boss upright for attachment cleaning as the hose on the windtunnel be too difficult to extend far and the Boss attachment would spring apart with any kind of tension . this be perfect for step , car , the laundry room and ceiling as you simply walk and suction . the one drawback be that I have a favorite horsehair brush attachment that do not fit due to they latch design but they provide more than enough attachment to make up for that . I wish consumer vac could produce such a sturdy hose system .
Vacuum	POS	5	these bag fit nicely into the Miele Canister . there be no plastic use , only cardboard , and the inventive `` enviro-closure '' be awesome at prevent dirt spilling out on bag change .
Vacuum	NEG	1	there be a problem with this vacuum cleaner just after 2 month of use . it have a lot of noise , you can not image the sound of it . it be also warm up easily . vacuum capability be ok but not great . it be heavy . I certainly not recommend this vacuum cleaner .
Vacuum	NEU	3	run with paper waste collection bag instead of the provide cloth bag make the unit very weak on suction . I would recommend a small square shop vac instead . such as ridgid 4.5 Gallon my Hoover arrive miss the follow part : 1 . bag 2 . belt to hold bag to bag support tube 3 . bag support tube the instruction be so poor , you might never figure out you be miss these thing and start use it without the paper bag .
Vacuum	POS	5	I already own a factory recondition version of this model , so I know it would be good go in . I need a second one for a second house . these baby deliver a huge bang for the buck . they use paper bag -lrb- cheaper to buy on Amazon -rrb- but its still cheaper and easier than clean a bagless hepa filter , which be expensive to replace every 6 month . and this vacuum really suck the carpet clean . my only disappointment be that it come without the `` power paw '' hose attachment , which I would have like to have . they tell I that the recondition unit do not come with those accessory .
Vacuum	POS	4	I buy this because of back problem , it be so easy and convenient to use . glad I make the purchase .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this thing work great at full charge ... so for about 5-10 min or so . then it start drop off pretty fast . I buy this about 2 year ago and I be pretty disappoint with the battery life . the other downside be it charge very slowly so it be not like you can use it for 10 min , charge it quickly then use it again . if I have a chance to do this over , I would by a cord unit .
Vacuum	POS	5	I get mine at Big Lots Dept Store . I pay $ 99.00 , and it be refurbish . this come with a full warranty . I have have it now for about 2 month . its a very basic no frill add vac . do a great job . now if I could just teach my cat to run it , I would have it make in the shade .
Vacuum	POS	4	this vacuum be one of the best vacuum I bring it move easily and pick up easy . these two thing be highly important to I consider I be in a wheelchair . I would prefer self propel but for the price you can not beat the way it move .
Vacuum	POS	5	I own my own cleaning business and this vacuum be a time saver on stair and hardwood floor . any high pill carpet though I have to use another vacuum for . light weight and great .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have have this vacuum for several month now and I love it ! the first time I use it I be horrify at the amount of stuff I could hear come out of my carpet . I love that I could actually hear it because it be such a quiet vacuum compare to most other -lrb- it be the quietest I have ever have -rrb- . in 10 year this be my fourth vacuum and I be in love with it . it be perhaps heavier than some but it be so easy to manuveur that I do not notice it be weight . the suction be wonderful and it do well on tile too which surprise I . some vacuum just blow the dirt around but not this one . the extension wand look like it would not reach far but it stretch to be very long . I can easily leave it at the bottom of we stair and reach up 8 stair or more . I would certainly recommend this vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	4	decent replacement bag and I have use many of these with no problem . I would have rate they at 5 star but they do have one small glitch . I believe these be originally design for older Bosch model with a elongate container\/bag compartment . the current model bag compartment be wider than long so that be the glitch . the Bosch bag be design for this and if you be look for a better fit , then I would choose that route . but for the price , these be a great alternative . in my opinion 20 bag at the same cost as 5 Bosch bag be worth it . they do fit fine and might hold a little less due to be lengthwise . instead of just insert the bag , I will open\/fluff it up and then insert it . it take all of about 10 seconds . if you just insert the bag , the bottom fold over and obviously it 'll affect how much it can hold . as a quick comparison Bosch bag sit sideways and these sit lengthwise . Hope that help .
Vacuum	NEG	2	this 4870mz machine clean very well , but I be not the least impressed with the cheap plastic part . the on\/off switch be cheap and have go bad cause the wire go to it to melt . it be a wonder it do not cause a fire . I would rather spend more money for a quality build machine that will last .
Vacuum	POS	5	great vacuum for the price . I be extremely pleased with this purchase . the vacuum have a great amount of power and the attachment provide make it possible to clean any surface . amazingly fast shipping as well .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be a really nice little vacuum , very versatile for small job . we use it on hardwood floor and well as rug and have pretty good suction power and be very easy to glide on carpet of rug when bristel be turn on ... seem that the rotate action help propel it forward . we seem to be vacuum more often give the size and portability . highly recommend for small job or apartment . the con I see be the capacity ... remember , this be not a big Vacuum , but as long as you do not mind empty it after each vacuum , you should be fine
Vacuum	POS	5	this little commercial vacuum cleaner be one of the best buy out there . I can clean up great Pyrenees hair with ease and empty out the bag and start over again with out clog up cleaner like other machine I have kill with dog hair .
Vacuum	POS	4	it be perfect product for the price I get it for . great suction power and do the job as advertise . my carpet look really clean after use this vacuum . I be really with this buy .
Vacuum	POS	5	the Black & Decker car vacuum be compact , plug into you car outlet , and do a good job of remove my dog 's constantly shed white hair . it come in a handy carry case , and store in the car easily . it be simple to put together and get the job do .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be one fantastic vacuum , I can go over the carpet several time and could not believe the stuff that come up . this be not a expensive vacuum but man oh man it really suck ... ... ... ... in a good way -lrb- ... -rrb-
Vacuum	POS	5	I order this vacuum base on consumer report , concentrate especially on its ability to pick up pet hair . it work marvelously . my rug be totally free of pet hair after I have vacuum . it be a bit heavy , but I can live with that . the attachment be simple to work , and it be easy to turn off the beater bar -lrb- for my more fragile handmade rug -rrb- . it be quiet , too . this be the best vacuum I have ever own . it come quickly and well package , and this be the best price I find anywhere .
Vacuum	POS	5	the moment I plug this vacuum in and turn it on , I love it ! I love the fact that I be not tug on a canister behind I all around the house . I can vacuum a entire floor from one plug because of the long power chord . the suction be excellent . the motor be relatively quiet . I like the small head for vacuum in small place . I would highly recommend this vacuum to anyone with hard wood floor .
Vacuum	NEG	2	buy this vac after read review and check consumer report site . the suction be terrific and it seem to be build by the Romans . it would likely be very suitable for a large house with thick wall to wall carpet . however , my house have hardwood floor with fringed area rug . the vacuum be so powerful that you have to be very careful around rug fringe and it be so heavy that it be very tiring to use on hardwood floor -lrb- although it offer this setting -rrb- . the foot pedal be extremely stiff which be very annoying , and the cord fastener -lrb- which pin down the last bit of cord when you wind it up for storage -rrb- be so stiff that it be unusable . I be search for something more suitable for my house .
Vacuum	POS	4	I really dig this little vac . it reach into space that would be inaccessible with any other hand vacuum I have see . it be very convenient to be able to set the canister down , or hold it in you other hand , as you vacuum -lrb- especially for door jamb and other place that require a reach -rrb- . I find it to be perfect for clean up my little apartment . after read other review , I expect the battery life to be worse than it be , though I do wish vac like this come with adaptor . I recommend it .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have be use Oreck Vacuums for year . I know that there be other vacuum on the market that look great and have a lot of hype , but forget they ! this be the best and it last forever . it be light , get under bed , easy to use , and clean great .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I can tell you one thing , it certainly do suck ! Ours last no longer than 6 month before we give up on it and throw it out . only a week or so after purchase this vacuum , it start make a awful buzz sound that would not go away regardless of how many time you clean it or remove debris from the head . most of the time it seem like it be just blow dirt around rather than suck it up . the front of the vacuum be constantly cover in dust and vacuum cleaner powder .
Vacuum	POS	4	I think maybe potential purchaser would like to know that the fhv1200 Flex Vac run for a little over seven minute continuously before the motor start to slow down and lose power . -lrb- never run a nicd power product completely dead , some of the battery cell will `` reverse '' and be permanently damage . -rrb- the time to fully recharge after run the vac this long be about 20 hour -lrb- figure a full day to keep it simple -rrb- . the charger be a small wall adapter type . I think the power be very good for a rechargeable vacuum -lrb- a little more than you average `` dustbuster '' -rrb- . as a example , it will easily suck up cat litter , small pebble , and pot soil , but will have trouble suck up a glass marble or penny . I do not think mine be too loud . it have that high speed `` whine '' sound combine with the sound of rush air , but the combination be somewhat muffle . it definitely do not sound weak . it almost sound like a corded vac . the fhv1200 smaller than you might expect , and the build quality be very good . I be not normally fond of black and Decker , but I like this little machine . ... and the blue led charge light be cool ! Minus one star because it take a looooong time to recharge ...
Vacuum	NEG	1	we get this vacuum because it have great review , and when we see the Amazon price it be a do deal . I like to vacuum and could not wait to use it . it be easy to put together . it be very light , so light it feel cheep . the cord be very short so you have to change outlet often . to clean the filter you have to put you hand up inside it and dust fly 's everywhere , and it be just gross . when I use it I could not even get it to pick up grass that have be track in . when you try to use the hose , everything fly 's out the back end all over the place . we think maybe it be just that unit , so we return it to Amazon -lrb- super easy -rrb- . they send we a new one right away . and same thing , nothing get suck up unless you have the time to go over each spot a dozen time . it be junk !
Vacuum	NEG	1	buy a vacuum , it quit work after one or two use , I have be tryint to contact the seller with get no response ! Super dissapointed with the seller !! they have be terrible to deal and still to date have not take care of the issue , Amazon have step in to make thing right .
Vacuum	POS	4	my wife and I have decide several year ago to go with a bagless model also make by Eureka . not a good idea , for we anyway . the dirt cup fill up quickly with we Golden Retriever 's hair and be constantly clog . when I decide to go back to this model that use bag I be a little bit skeptical thinking we be make a move backwards in ` clean technology ' . I be glad we do now though . we have have this machine for a couple of month and it be by far a better unit . this vacuum have not clog once in that time and even with we constant need to pick up West Texas dirt the bag be only about half full in that time . you do need to adjust for carpet height closely to maintain a good suction , but it be very simple to tell when it be not adjust correctly . my only concern have be with the light plastic construction on some part , but I guess that be the trade off you make for a lower price . we also buy the year supply of bag , filter , etc. and after see the retail price of bag around town , we be glad we do . if you do not want to spend the money on Dyson or another high dollar machine , this be a good choice .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be a powerful vacuum cleaner . the level adjustment and the attachment work great . it be pretty heavy and may not be a appropriate choice for those who need a lighter vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	we return this vaccum . the hose be too long and will not stay in it be place . it flop all over while you be vaccume . -lrb- have to wind it around the front of the machine to keep it from come undo . -rrb- the attachment fall out of they place as well , so you be always fiddle with they and the hose . the cord get tangle up with the hose and attachment , so that be another thing you have to stop and fix  eureka 4870mz Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner  it seem to pick up well , but all the adjusting and fiddle negate that . not a user friendly item .
Vacuum	POS	5	after break my Dirt Devil bagless vac -lrb- no fault of it be own -rrb- , I have to find a new vacuum . what I favor about this vacuum be the easy release of the dirt chamber and the better filter design compare to the Dirt Devil . surprisingly , this vacuum be quite noticeably quieter than the Dirt Devil , yet do not seem to lack any power in comparison . I think at first it be weaker since it be so noticeably quieter , but that just be not the case . assembly be very easy , I recall only need to attach the handle with a single screw and it be pretty much ready to go ! I have be a Dirt Devil loyalist since my Dirt Devil Breeze be still run strong after 5 year before replace it with a new one , but Bissell have definitely impressed I with this one ...
Vacuum	NEG	1	it be great for a month or so but the battery keep get weaker and weaker . I throw it away . one star for longevity failure .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this vacuum cleaner be heavy to lift or move in another direction , it be cover with dust on bottom part of machine . it seem to pick up dirt very good but I use on my sofa where the pet hair be the worst but it do not do a good job at all . I do like it for a large area because it move by itself just when you change direction it be heavy . I like the attachment with it , so easy to use for sofa .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have have the Oreck XL2100RH Commercial for ten year now and think it be a great vacuum . I just buy a new roller for it on Amazon for a great price along with some belt . have to replace the fan housing assembly three year ago when the plastic crack , but it work fine now . just do not let the handle hit the ground too hard , I think that may be how I crack the fan housing . keep it clean around the roller and belt for optimum performance . it be amazing how fast dirt and pet hair will build . it do a great job on pick up pet hair . for the price , you can not go wrong .
Vacuum	POS	4	i have several cat in the house , wood floor and linoleum kitchen . the little vacuum work pretty good ... probably not good enough for the price . i would be more impressed if it have a swivel head . it do not blow the lint and hair around , but do actually pick up pretty good . it lack suction to pick up small particle of cat litter , but all in all be not bad . the charge only last about 10 minute , and would be nice if it last just a few minute longer . my square footage be about 1500 foot . i do love the cordless feature and it do fold up nicely to charge ...
Vacuum	NEG	1	I just throw away the Miele s7210 . it be less than a year old . the bag will not stay on the post to catch the dirt . the part of the cover be make of such cheap plastic they break off . it not worth the massive amount of money . DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT !!!!
Vacuum	POS	4	I be not impress when I start to assemble the vacuum , it seem a little flimsy , light plastic cover and the filter fall out at first . I be more impressed with the power and suction once I assemble and use it . this be a nice vacuum and do a good job cleaning . I have not use the attachment yet . I would buy this product again , it do the job and the price be very good . I have a commercial type Hoover prior to this purchase , I be use to good cleaning from a vacuum , this do not disappoint .
Vacuum	POS	4	I have have mine for about 2 year now and have drop it down we stair at least once , I routinely drop the handle wand thing on we concrete floor and basically do not baby the machine at all . it have have ZERO damage , apart from the baseboard paint scuff all over the container . this thing be build like a rock . the power head be annoy in that it `` skip '' when be pull backward on low pile carpet . I do not know if that be avoidable . the `` 3 speed '' on the vacuum be also annoy in that it default to the medium speed anytime you unplug . I will admit that there be rare instance where I will not want full suction , but hey who in the world do NOT wan the vacuum to suck at high power pretty much all the time ? that kind of annoy I . other than that , I love it , and I must say that it be worth the price . every other vacuum I have have have have moderate or complete damage after a few year . this be go strong . I do wish the cord be longer . of course it vary by one 's house size , but I always seem to need 10 more foot on the cord .
Vacuum	POS	4	we have have one for year , we need another one for the second floor as repeat haul up and down the stair have hurt the old one . I have purchase a huge stock of filter and bag for this model so decide to go with it - not to mention that it be still a consumer digest best buy . no issue whatsoever , it be probably a little noisy but we be use to it - have not owner another vacuum model in over 6 year . the additional accessory that have a roller attach to the hose be great for carpeted stair . you can not go wrong with this solid piece of machinery .

Vacuum	NEG	1	this be the 5th vacuum I have ever own in my life . I have have it for 5 month now and absolutely can not stand it . it emit a high pitched shrill when in operation and be exremely loud . it give I a headache listen to it . it be annoy that it always switch into bare floor mode when upright . every single time I use it , I have to lean down and change it off bare floor to carpet . the release latch be difficult to engage & I can not do it just by a simple step on it . I have to lean down & pry it open with my hand . the power button be not conveniently located . it be on the main shaft , require the user to lean way down to turn it on rather than it be a simple flick from the handle . I also do not like the `` power paw '' attachment located on the very front top . it be constantly get knock off . I have not notice that be do any particular better cleaning than any other machine I have own . I definitely would not have purchase it if I have try it out in a store before-hand rather than get it on line .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I just purchase the Miele twist and I know how these review be important to I , so I hope that I can help someone esle who be consider the Miele s7 series -lrb- any model -rrb- . I research the motor as I be tell by the salesperson that the `` twist '' have a cheaper motor than the Salsa , etc. . this be not true . they all have the same motor - look at Miele 's website . the $ 100 difference be the filter and headlight . you can purchase the better filter and put it in the twist and have the same machine without the light . I debate on purchase off of the web , so I could save money . in my research I find that Authorized Dealers DO NOT honor the warranty if purchase from the web !!! so buyer beware . upon purchase and give it a test run , when I go to use the hose attachment it come out of the machine before I could even stretch it to full length , which be really not very far , if you like to vac high place - forget it . the hose attachment be much like a dryer vent . bottom line : the Miele twist be very easy to vac with and because it be on a petite side it can get to many little place and the swivel future be wonderful . it vacuum well , however , go over the same area with my old Riccar , I could hear it pick up debris that apparently the Miele miss . I think this machine be good , however , I think there be other that might be better for the price . I rate it a 3 star .
Vacuum	POS	5	though large and somewhat cumbersome , this fine piece of equipment be incredibly powerful and offer a good range of setting and extension . I be also able to find replacement bag very easily on amazon . two thumb up .
Vacuum	POS	4	have own it for several week now , so far so good . I be hear little thing get pick up that I have never hear before , and we vacuum somewhat regularly -lrb- at least 1-2x per week -rrb- . do not stink or smell like dust so the description of it be a good one for allergy seem to hold up . overall , a good buy for under $ 120 through amazon.com Retail price be closer to $ 200 , but then again , no store carry it within 30mus of we location .
Vacuum	POS	4	we have be very happy with the use of this product so far . my mom have one and have have some trouble with belt but we have not have any problem yet .
Vacuum	POS	5	this vacuum work PERFECT for hardwood floor and on carpet ! it be so easy to use and fold up for super easy storage ! I want to get a Dyson model but find out the battery would only last for 14 min when fully charge and do not work well on carpet . Consumer Reports also rate this model high and that be how I end up purchase this .
Vacuum	NEG	2	this be probably my fault for not read more carefully but I think this would be a good vacuum for my car , to clean the upholstery and floor as well as the mat . it be actually a mini size which would be ok for a computer keyboard but nothing else that I could use it for so needless to say , I be very disappointed .
Vacuum	NEG	1	get the previous version of this model -lrb- red pet vac -rrb- for christam last year -lrb- 08 -rrb- I live in a small apt and only vacuum about once a month . the vacuum already break . something happen to the brush , not the belt . the brush end up tear up the underside of the vacuum melting and shredding the plastic . now im stick use the hose to vacuum everything ! for the price -lrb- over $ 200 -rrb- be be definitely not worth it ! im very disappointed . try to get a refund or get it fix an customer service would do nothing for I . also the vacuum be very big and very very heavy . very disappoint with Eureka brand . look for a new vacuum at a affordable price but dont know which company to trust !?!?
Vacuum	POS	5	as the title say , for the price this be a great vacuum . my wife and I have a 2000 sq ft house that be mostly hardwood with some carpet . it clean on both nicely . when we get the dog she want , or the kid we both want I think we may upgrade . I might be totally underestimate this though . I have yet to see how it handle pet hair , or how messy my future kid will be . plus : the canister be easy to clean . there be a adjust knob for the floor type you be vacuum . lastly , I have not have to use the add piece because simply remove the house have prove sufficient for pick up anything the base can not . the one negative I can think of ... as with most vacuum the cord be a bit of a chore . all in all , it be cheap , it work . Great for light vacuuming and possibly more .
Vacuum	NEG	1	this vacuum have give we nothing but problem since we have have it . after the first month of use it the suction of the hose would not work properly if the whole sweeper be not take apart and clean in the sink after only a week worth of use . then it would start to stink like rot fish after use and wash under warm water , which the instruction say to do to clean the filter . would never buy this or recommend to anyone !
Vacuum	POS	5	this be one of the lowest-priced bagless upright hepa vacuum available on the market . in the 2 month since first use this vacuum , I have have be very pleased with its performance . it be very good at pick up stuff in my carpet . the only nitpick I have be that the dirt cup be small compare to other vacuum I have owned\/used , and empty it require expose the lower filter to some debris drop down into it . other than that , this Bissell be reasonably powerful , easy to use , easy to assemble , and reliable . the furniture brush work well . for the money , this vacuum be hard to beat . it be a excellent value and well worth you consideration .
Vacuum	POS	5	plenty of suction , nice long cord , for quick pick up . not the best for deep cleaning rug , but for the price , a good value .
Vacuum	POS	5	this be a must have vacuum ! my mom buy my two sister and I one over 25 year ago and we continue to use they and have give many away as gift . it be the best vacuum for hardwood floor , tile or linoleum . the suction be fantastic and since everything go straight into the bag you can pick up sand or even small piece of glass with it . it be great for clean out the car . I guarantee you will be surprise by the suction of this little Hoover Portapower !
Vacuum	POS	5	so after 8 year my hoover vacuum bit the dust . I actually do not do most of the vacuuming , my boyfriend do . so i research for the best vacuum with all of he requirement : 1 . must be bagless . `` I hate fumble with those stupid bag . '' 2 . must be upright . `` I do not want to be drag half the machine behind I '' 3 . must have cleaning tool . `` I have to get under the table and the baseboard too , it get gross ! '' this one meet all of he requirement ; bagless , upright , 4 tool . and it meet mine : must be reasonably price . we go to we local target and buy it , not ten minute after we be home my boyfriend have it out of the box and be go nut on we apartment . it be honestly hilarious , every minute he be scream out something like , `` this light be awesome babe !! '' `` oh my god , babe ! check out this turbo brush ! '' `` this thing have so much suction !! look at the crap I pull out of the carpet '' `` oh man , this vacuum rock !! '' we have only have it for a day but my entire apartment have be vacuum not once , but twice because he have to move all the furniture to vacuum underneath it . I love this vacuum because my boyfriend love it . you swear he be five-years-old and I buy he the newest , coolest , most awesomest toy ever . best purchase ever .
Vacuum	POS	5	seriously , not much to say that all the user -lrb- and vacuum repairman -rrb- have not already ... this be the best vacuum that I have ever use , hand down . I do a lot of research and consider all of the very expensive wind-tunnel , canister , and bag-less system , but `` Carpet pro '' keep pop up everywhere . the final straw be when I go to a vacuum store and repair shop and after about 20 minute of talk to the technician about the top of the line eureka and Dyson unit , I tell he that I be tire of buying , repair , and replace vacuum . I ask he what to buy if I simply want a well-working vacuum that will be the last vacuum I spend money on . he reply be two unit , the Carpet pro and another brand which cost in the region of $ 700 for the entry model . he state that both unit be `` truly professional '' -lrb- and not just a ordinary vacuum with the word `` professional '' write on it , in the case of the Carpet pro -rrb- and each be design for very aggressive daily use , such as to be use by a cleaning service or theater employee . they be not design for they feature or marketing trick , but for longevity and quality . if the repairman can compare this vacuum to a $ 700 unit , then I be all-in at just over two hundred dollar . important note : this vacuum be rate lower power than many other compete model , but the Carpet pro have far more suction , I can personally attest . this thing will suck you carpet off the ground , not a exaggeration . my very messy carpet in my art room look nearly \* brand new \* after I vacuum with this unit . if I have picture , you still would not believe it . this unit be very solid and the picture do not do justice . this unit be build extremely well in Germany , and consider that this unit have a real stainless steel beater bar -lrb- the rolling-pin-looking thing that hit the carpet , dislodge dirt -rrb- , stainless ball bearing for the bar , and the overall build quality make this unit a clear winner . no , there be no fancy vortex and you have to use a bag , but there be not a vortex vacuum on the market that could compete with this unit . I dare you to find another make of vacuum that include stainless bearing , let alone one with a stainless steel -lrb- or just \* METAL \* -rrb- beater-bar for anywhere in this price range . most vacuum use plastic beater-bar -lrb- or rarely wood , if you be lucky -rrb- and they have a press rod through the center of the bar , through which it spin . these will eventually melt and become loose ; rattle on the rod and in the compartment . not the Carpet pro , which have dedicate seal stainless steel bearing and the entire bar be metal , not just the metal rod that go through the plastic beater-bar , like that of the competitor . another thing to note , clear plastic be much more brittle than color plastic , and also much more prone to be damage or discolor by uv like that which come from the sun . most competitor use clear plastic that feel light , flimsy , and cheap , apparently to show you that the unit be work and to give the impression of it be more technical than it truly be . also realize that a lot of money be spend by the manufacturer to make they product look like it be technologically advance . money be not only spend on the design and r+d , but also in have to mold plastic in fancy , complicated , design and color to give that appearance . but this actually hurt the durability and longevity of they product and cost you more to buy the unit . the Carpet pro use a very rigid and thick color A.B.S. high impact plastic that do not flex or feel light . instead , it feel like I could whack this thing with a baseball bat and it would not break . it also feel like it be design for function and then wrap in this strong plastic . most of the other unit look like they be design and function come after . bottom line be that the Carpet pro , from a distance or picture , look like a very cheap , generic vacuum . however as soon as you get closer , touch it , or even use it , you will know the difference . anyway , the technician be ask $ 400 for the unit and if he would have lower he price to $ 300 dollar , I would have buy it through he . however , I be able to buy it on Amazon for 207 include s + h. if I have no other choice , I would have be happy pay the $ 400 after own this vacuum for about 6 month . search thoroughly ... read all review of this vacuum on Amazon and throughout the internet . if you want marketing and a fancy-looking vacuum , buy elsewhere . if you want something that will last the rest of you life , build better , and also perform better than almost any vacuum on the planet , this be you answer .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I have purchase this vacuum partially due to the rave review here . however , my expectation be not fully meet . while I would agree that this be a good vac for floor and small rug , I would not commend the suck power of the motor , and hold it on the showlder do not get comfortable with prolonged use and when you need to bend -lrb- it fall off -rrb- . in general for the price it be a good deal but it be useful to remember : you get what you pay for ...
Vacuum	POS	5	just purchase the Eureka Boss Smart Upright , base on a review in Consumer Reports -lrb- a `` cr best '' -rrb- . this vacuum have unbelievable suction !!! it pick up item my expensive Kirby miss and great on hardwood\/tile floor ! the attachment be easily accessible , too . you will not be dissappoint with you purchase .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be very happy with this product . great suction and easy to operate and empty .
Vacuum	POS	5	this vacuum cleaner perform exactly as I expect . I set the Roomba to run every day while I be at work and it sweep up everything and then return to it be charge base . the Roomba will never take the place of a standard vacuum cleaner that do a much deeper cleaning but now I only need to clean once a week . if you have pet like I do , you will need to empty the collection bin every day . but this be still faster than a regular vacuum cleaning every day .
Vacuum	POS	4	I get this vacuum for my fav . drive , since it go through a lot of abuse like camping and frequent visit to crystal beach with friend . have trouble clean all that sand every time , especially if you be finicky about you drive , so long story short , this vacuum as i call it cyclone , have a powerful motor , with rpm 's better then most of the handy vacuum on market . the pivot nose be a great help since it reach tough space ... the power cord be long enough to reach far end ... . and can be hook up to you cigarette lighter port ... powerful enough to suck penny so be careful ... . though a bit over prize toy ... but worth buying ... ...
Vacuum	POS	5	I be afraid that this vacuum would not have enough power to pick up the dirt in my car because of some of the review . I find that it work fine ! it be not a high power vacuum , but it pick up very well in between . the adjustable nozzle be a plus . it have be able to get to most -lrb- if not all -rrb- area of my car . it be very convenient .
Vacuum	POS	5	we get this Black & Decker compact vacuum cleaner more than a month ago and have be very happy with the quality , construction and performance of this little guy . First of all , it come package in a reusable box with a handle . the unit , the attachment and the little attachment holder that snap on to the unit so you can carry you attachment around the house with you all fit in the box for neat storage . as other reviewer say , this cordless vac must be recharge for about 20 hour after use . the charge last long enough to do those little cleanup chore around the house : vacuum up seed around the bird cage -lrb- use the round rubber attachment for floor -rrb- , clean the baseboard -lrb- there be a neat brush edger for that -rrb- , get into the crevice in the couch -lrb- a four foot hose help -rrb- and vacuum the stair . it be light and easy to carry -- I hate have to haul out the big vacuum for every little thing . the vac be bagless and easy to clean : just open the plastic door on the side and dump or brush out the accumulate dust and debris . I have have all sort of cordless vac and this be the best one yet .
Vacuum	POS	5	all the preview review be right about this product . it give enough power to get all the dirt that it be in you car . I must admit , for the price , the product be axcellent and easy to clean .
Vacuum	POS	4	my husband be skeptical when i tell he i order a vacuum online ! he 1st question be , `` if it be commercial do that mean it be go to be super heavy ? '' Ugh ... have not even think of that and do not remember see any review about it be weight !! I be happy to report that this vacuum be not heavy at all and probably lighter than my last . thing i love about it ... great suction , weight , and the way it lay flat to clean under furniture . thing i do not love about it ... this model do not come w \/ extension hose and the one that be on it be SHORT and i also do not care for the way the cord wind . that say , i think this be a great sweeper , especially for the price !!
Vacuum	NEG	1	because I work in a different state from where I actually live , I buy this 18-month ago in order to have a vacuum cleaner in the apartment I be rent . it seem to work ok but it be not long before I notice that the dirt never make it through the hose into the clear area where it be suppose to accumulate . I look up information about this and it be suggest that I could wash the filter , so I have try that but nothing happen . now , about every other time I vacuum I have to remove the hose and clean out all the dust and fiber that have accumulate . I have hear that bagless vacuum be bad , but this one seem to barely suck the dirt off the top of the carpet and I certainly do not feel like it ever provide a good cleaning . I be pretty sure when I move out of this apartment I should borrow a decent vacuum from a friend in order to give the carpet a good cleaning . I be also glad that I own a Hoover at my actual house and I certainly would not consider buy another Bissell after this experience .
Vacuum	POS	5	even if it be not price so low . it be work well on carpet , any height . the hose attachment be easy to use & seem pretty durable . it work fine on bare floor -lrb- ceramic tile , wood , concrete -rrb- . with the money save on this I also purchase the Bissell Pet Hard Floor Vacuum for $ 50 which do a fantastic job on the bare floor & be very lightweight . this vacuum be also not a heavyweight which I really like . so , wow for $ 130 I be set to clean & these machine do a good job .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I buy this to replace another Eureka Boss Vacume cleaner , that finally wear out . it be very similar but the vacume hose be much shorter on this new one . I be estimate it at 5 foot but I believe Eureka state it be longer . I replace the vacume hose on my old Eureka twice so I know this one will break\/tear also at the noozle . I have already order the extended 15 foot vacume hose to replace the short hose one on the new one . would recommend anyone buying this vacume cleaner to also buy the 15 foot extend hose at the same time . with that say , the vacume cleaner perform well , especially on carpet . it be noisy but most vacume cleaner be . I like this new one . have always have Eureka cleaner and be happy with they . give it three star because the hose be just too short on it . buy the 15 foot extension and you have a great cleaner .
Vacuum	POS	5	just get it and totally impressed with the power and they variety of attachment . it also have a nice long cord which be very handy .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I get this vacuum a few week ago and i hate it , it be awful it do not really suck up anything . I would not recommend this : -rrb-
Vacuum	NEG	2	I would not buy this product again because of poor design and quality . the vacuum be basic and function as it should but feel cheap and piece continually fall off . for the money I would look for a Kirby on the secondary market or buy any other brand .
Vacuum	POS	5	the robot go to work from the very first day . my husband have a guy night that weekend and all he could talk about be how impressed he be . I have not have to complain about pet hair since . he program it to do it be thing at 2 pm while we be both still at work . awesome !
