Sandal	POS	5	the keen sandal be simply the best I have ever have . they be very comfortable , fit you foot perfectly and the toe protection they offer be superior to any other I have ever try !
Sandal	NEU	3	after year of speculate , I purchase this 1st pair of Birks not know what to expect . the cradle you foot be in , be at first difficult to get use to with the ridge but soon become comfortable . they may be good for walk anywhere that do not have pebble , because once a pebble find it way onto the footbed , you have to take off the shoe to shake it out . otherwise the comfort level be definitely outstanding . I have be advise to not get they wet , that for I at least , be a new concept when wear sandal . at this price , they be definitely worth a try .
Sandal	POS	5	this be a gift purchase . always a great purchase with Rainbow . usually buy brown or tan . go for black . happy with purchase .
Sandal	POS	5	comfortable , hold up well , dry out after get wet and dont look dark like the leather one get after get wet , and they look good too .
Sandal	POS	5	have keen item before , easy to put on & take of . love the man 's shoe because of the wide foot . find it more room when item arrive do not have to break in . wear my first pair to the old country , have to take shoe of at security check point go through do not have to struckle . ship good , get item within 7 day . love to buy from Amazon .
Sandal	POS	5	this be my first birken actually , I use to think that they be too hard to wear and that I would hate they . well , give it 1 week so it fit perfectly you foot contour and I promise you will not take it off again . I spend my whole summer wear it all the time . it be very comfortable , it go with anything I be wear and it be very light in the foot . it be half a size larger actually , so keep that in mind when you order it ! all in all , I would buy it again !
Sandal	POS	5	I give these to my son last week for a birthday present . this be he second pr . the first pair last 7 summer . he like the removable strap and find they very comfortable . he be please with the fit -lrb- wear 10.5 and I get size 11 since they do not have he exact size . thank you Amazon for another great bargain !
Sandal	POS	4	all of these positive review lead I to believe that many of they be fake . that be say I like these sandal . they have have cover for you toe so you do not jam you they on anything , they have bumpy bottom for better grip , and they feel comfortable to walk in . the one thing that I do not like about these sandal be there be only one strap ! even when I tighten the strap all the way they feel loose if I do not wear a double pair of sock with they . I think I buy a size too big but the lack of extra strap for a tighter fit be a bad idea . I be return these but I may buy a smaller size in the future .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these for my husband for we Disney World vacation . they be great and comfortable for the whole week !
Sandal	POS	5	I be look for some sandal there be water proof . I have own a bunch of other leather Rainbow sandal but find they do not do well when they get even a little wet . these sandal hit the spot for just in time for my beach vacation . they be pretty comfortable but not as nice as the leather . I find they dry quickly and be not at all slippery on possibly slippery surface . I do not remember see on any of the tag if these have a lifetime warranty like the leather version .
Sandal	POS	5	pro : - solid , stable sandal with great foot support . - as always with keen shoe , the wide toe area make it very comfortable . - opening be wider than the classic Newport which make it airier for the summer . - Top be make of nylon in h2 vs leather in the classic . this make it quicker dry and lighter overall . - climb a jaggy volcanic hill in Saudi Arabia and Mukenya in Kenya , and the traction be amazing on these . con : - sand will mound up in the toe area since there be no hole for it to escape . - if you be hike trail with lot of loose debris they will get in the shoe and it be a bit of a nuisance to try and get they out without take it off . recommend you try the classic Newport and the h2 before you purchase . I find the classic 's footbed completely incompatible with my foot , but the h2 be perfect . the reverse may be true for you .
Sandal	POS	5	I have this one before and worn up . need a new and same one because it be perfect for my foot - comfortable ,
Sandal	POS	5	I be go on a camping trip that involve cave walking and learn at the last minute my sneaker would not be appropriate and be advise to buy a pair of Keens . I have -lrb- 48 hour before I leave on the trip and make this purchase with a one day delivery -- and it arrive on time . the shoe be perfect , comfortable and have not only walk in cave and up gentle sloping cliff , but in the backyard -lrb- very comfortable -rrb- and even in the ocean and beach in Hawaii . these be perfect shoe if you have to deal with moisture while walk . 5 Stars for sure .
Sandal	POS	5	I use to buy this 5 bottle at a time and have I know they be go to discontinue the scent , I would have buy as much of it as possible . it be the perfect type of sandalwood scent for this mix . impossible to come by lately . I wish they would start make this again !
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these with we Colorado trip this come May in mind and I have gotta say we get a great price ! and my husband have never once like a pair of sandal , but these in he word `` Feel amazing , so comfortable '' they look really nice on too : - -rrb- I be order a pair for myself right now !
Sandal	POS	5	these have become my go to shoe in summertime . this be my first parus of keen shoe and I bout a second pair base on how happy I be with these . you can ; t go wrong with these .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these shoe because I need something to get around in for a 2 week trip to Hawaii . I get they a couple day before we leave so I have no time to break they in , but they feel break in the first day i wear they . I wear they hike and on the beach and on volcanic rock . I have never be wild about sandal , but I can tell you I be anxious for spring in Colorado so I can wear they again . I be a photographer , and I pretty much expect to wear these pretty much all the time during summer landscape shoot ! I highly recommend they !
Sandal	POS	5	these be so cool I be so glad i can wear these and be cool like a surfer even though i live in the central valley
Sandal	POS	5	buy they close to 3 year ago and they be still go strong , even with daily beach use for a solid year and a half .
Sandal	POS	5	I be on about my fourth pair of these . they be almost the only shoe I wear on the boat in the summertime . the sipe sole afford traction on a wet deck . I find the best price on Amazon , so I order two pair ... one for home and one for the boat .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these shoe for a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon . I go from the river to hike rocky path , sandy path , down creek bed and back and not one blister , and they provide great support on the rock as well . I be go to buy another pair . love 'em !
Sandal	NEG	1	great concept , but poor quality . tear apart at the seem after one use ; a moderate 8 mile hike in the wood . these would be such a better product have they have better craftsmanship . definitely not worth $ 100 if you plan on do any actual hike with they .
Sandal	POS	4	I buy this because I like the product . I have have it before and about every 2 year I need a new pair since I wear they out . this product rock just like the one I have 2 year before that , and the one I have 2 year before that . I be a fan .
Sandal	POS	4	I get my exercise by walk in chest deep water . the surface I walk on be smooth -lrb- too smooth , occasionally -rrb- but these shoe keep I move well . they fit well and be very comfortable . I be have some difficulty become accustomed to the rubbing of my toe on the interior of the shoe but I will , no doubt , become inure . I be pleased with they . mike hogan
Sandal	NEU	3	these seem like nice sandal , and I think they would be comfortable if they fit . I order my normal shoe size , but they be much too small to wear . I recommend order a bigger size .
Sandal	POS	5	they be every thing that I expect . they look good and be comfortable and I expect they to last a very long time .
Sandal	POS	5	these sandal have be a must for my wardrobe since I buy my first pair about 5 year ago . they be comfortable and versatile , stylish and appropriate with jeans or a suit . I have receive many compliment about they , and have they in black and brown . I be glad they be available on Amazon .
Sandal	POS	5	these be super comfortable birk . Perfect for dress occasion or go to the beach . comfortable feel on top with solid corks\/leather-like material on sole .
Sandal	POS	5	I have a pair of keen sandal several year ago and really like they but the soleskept come unglued . this pair have a different sole and that will never be a problem . I have orthotic in some of my other shoe but these feel like they have good arch support right from the start . I be very satisfied with they !
Sandal	POS	4	there be plenty of review here explain how awesome these Keen 's be . I agree . these be the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn . wear they exclusively for a very active week-long trip to Kauai and they be perfect . keep my foot cool and comfortable and provide great support for hike and walk . I only have two criticism : they get smelly very quickly and the sole be not as grippy as expect . walk for a day or two in these and they will develop pretty strong foot odor . scrub they with soap and water get rid of it , but it return pretty quickly . also , I expect the black rubber tread to have good grip on rock and such . they be okay , but tend to slide more than expect . perhaps the sole be make to be more durable and be a little too hard to get good traction . they be great for dirt trail or on concrete or asphalt . I do not trust they on wet rock or slick surface .
Sandal	POS	5	Ok , I be not the `` review stuff online '' kind of person ; this be the first time I have do so . but as I put my four year-old pair of Keen Newport h2 sandal on this morning , I be totally appreciate they comfort and longevity ! I can honestly say that when these wear out -lrb- whenever that may be ! -rrb- , I will go out and buy another pair . they be just well-built , comfortable , and attractive as these kind of sandal could be . my foot have be so happy !
Sandal	POS	4	I receive these for part of a costume . the geta be very good quality , but note that they be not the traditional style : these have more the profile of a pair of high-heel than the more traditional double-t shape such as worn by character like Urahara Kisuke in Bleach . more likely , these could be worn in a costume in place of flat , black sandal . the strap feel a bit tight around the toe and strangely weak , though they feel like they will last through a weekend-long convention with no problem . that say , I receive these before they be re-list with the `` colorful strap , '' so you will not get the same sort of strap . the wood be surprisingly light but durable . I have accidentally clank the two together with no damage to either . these do have light sole , as well , so you geta will not be make direct contact with the floor . the pair I receive be almost precisely a men ' size 7 shoe . thankfully , my foot happen to be just smaller than that . they may take a little get use to , as I still can not wear they for more than a few hour at a time . these be definitely worth a shot if you have a way of make it work into either you wardrobe or you costume .
Sandal	NEG	2	very comfortable , foot love the massage from the nub . Quality have go south . the massage nub break off at a unreasonable rate . be prepare to buy replacement often once you get addict to these .
Sandal	POS	5	I purchase these for my 13 year old . they be instantly comfortable , and he wear they everywhere .
Sandal	NEG	2	I love my keen sandal , mostly due to nice fit , they be a little sweatty though . so much that I buy the shoe -lrb- very good -rrb- , buy the work boot -lrb- steel toe also very good -rrb- , buy the sock -lrb- not so good -rrb- . I do not honestly wear the h2 sandal that much , maybe have they about a year -lrb- buy they last late summer\/fall -rrb- , but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe , 4 -5 month a year or so . so we go to Grand Tetons , these be my `` off hike day '' shoe for the trip . we do a 6 mile flat hike and the back rip out of one of they . by the way the sock have hole in the side -lrb- not heal or toe like you might expect -rrb- . use to be all they product seem to have 5 star rating ... I think the expansion to all kind of shoe may be cause some kind of performance issue . so not much use , the tread on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heel rip . I dunno if I will get another keen shoe , I be see some of they newer stuff have some bad rating . still I would take they over almost anything Teva , but not at full price . I guess I would take another shot for $ 50 or $ 60 ... but for $ 100 they need to last more than a season .
Sandal	POS	5	I have use this sandal for hike , walk dry or in the rain , run , and bicycling , it handle everything ! never get a blister , and they feel so comfortable , even better than my Nike Airs , its amazing . I wear these the whole day my foot never experience any irritation , they be just great ! keen # 1 !
Sandal	POS	4	a lot of people say it feel a half size too small but I think it feel true to both size and width . I receive these shoe and be please to find that there be not any break-in time . I have a job where I walk around for 8 hour straight ; I wear these the first day without any pain later that evening or the next day . there be a adjustable elastic cord that can be tighten , but I think the shoe be more comfortable if they be leave a little loose . I have they tighten one day and notice a pinch sensation after a couple hour of use . another reason to wear they loose be that it make it easier to put they back on if you foot be wet or sweaty they feel like they have very good traction but I be not walk through river with slippery rock so it be not the best test . because these be closed-toe sandal , it create a problem when small rock , sand , or other object get into the shoe . I find that I can not just wiggle my foot around to get rid of the nuisance , I need to take the shoe completely off and dump it out . another thing I notice about these shoe be that it dry out the back of my heel . I only have to apply lotion once to correct the dryness and I have not have a problem since , but it be something to be aware of . overall this be a great sandal and I do not have to worry about stick or other object stab my toe because of the closed-toe feature . I have own these for about a month now and they do not show any sign of wear so I expect they to hold up for a long time . I would not recommend they for walk around on the beach because sand and rock get trap underneath you foot and up in the toe area , but for walk through river and as a casual shoe these be great . one last problem that I just think of be that they be not comfortable for stand around with minimal movement for long period of time . it be possibly just my foot , but anyone interested in these should try they on and stand around for a while to see how they feel .
Sandal	POS	5	this be the first pair of Keens my husband have have and he be pretty please with they - so comfortable and hopefully no more smelly foot !!! highly recommend they .
Sandal	POS	5	I be in my late 50 's and have not worn sandal since I be a kid . however , my son-in-law have a pair of these and recently let I try they on while visit . I be instantly hooked and order mine right away in time for a Florida beach vacation . they be send from the vendor in less time than promise and I have be wear they constantly since then . they be comfortable and well-made as Sperry boat shoe . -lrb- I have be through several pair of those over the last 35 year and love they . -rrb- they do not slip off you foot while walk and do not irritate between the toe . I recommend these even if you do not usually wear sandal , but be look for some casual attire for the hot weather .
Sandal	POS	5	Love Keens ! they be comfortable , easy to maintain , and look exactly the same after lot of wear . they be machine washable and tolerate all sort of abuse . would definitely recommend . these be purchase for my husband . they be he second pair and be pretty much the only thing he wear on he foot all summer .
Sandal	POS	5	I have purchase a total of five pair of this sandal over the year , and I have two still new in the box . I live in annual fear that Sperry will discontinue they . the cushy , just-right footb as well as the overall comfort and durability make these sandal a great value . they can be worn every wake minute even while walk great distance in total comfort . I always order my actual shoe size and get a perfect fit . Hooray for Sperry in keep old fashion , make to last value in a product that be a great performer .
Sandal	POS	4	these be great shoe as they offer firm support versus flip flop - yet just as cool -lrb- temperature wise -rrb- . these be my go-to outdoor shoe for summer , except for when I be run . I have even be tempt to wear these on a short run - but have not . the Keens be worth the price . shipping and order delivery from the seller go like clockwork .
Sandal	POS	5	my husband use to have a pair of birkenstock several year ago , and he always want to own another pair of Birkenstock . so I do some research before order from Amazon , one of my favorite online retailer . the shipping be fast with a nicely package . my husband be very happy with he gift . I be very pleased and happy with my purchase .
Sandal	NEU	3	i have a pair of these exact shoe that i wear for about 5 year before they wear out . i buy this pair last summer and they be just as wear out as the one i have for 5 year . the rubber and foam be both make of less durable product now . not nearly as supportive as they use to be . still comfortable when new , but it do not last long .
Sandal	POS	5	I receive my Birkenstocks in a timely manner ! they be comfortable the moment I put they on . I wear they almost everyday . the color be neutral , so it match nicely with a lot of outfit .
Sandal	POS	5	the very best walk shoe I have ever purchase . very resilient and resistnat to scuff and tear , unlike meny other I have try .
Sandal	POS	5	I have three pair of this sandal . my first pair -lrb- now my bicycling shoe -rrb- be purchase just prior to a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon . work well for the hiking in the canyon , walk in the river , and rafting in the Colorado . work great for everyday wear in Florida . the only shoe I wear now though my wife make I keep a pair of Allen Edmunds for funerals\/weddings . -lrb- I will be bury in my keen . -rrb- they be comfortable , great look -lrb- only sandal I ever own that people have ask where I get they -rrb- . great arch support .
Sandal	POS	5	the Sperry sandal be a well make product and have a sole that be very good on wet and slippery deck . I would difinately recommend this product .
Sandal	NEU	3	size run a little small but over all a decent sandal . this be my second pair and like original one better .
Sandal	POS	4	I buy these as a replacement pair for the old leather reef flip flop that I love but they no longer make . as state in other review , expect a serious break in period . these sandal be very tight at first and actually rub the top of my foot raw the first time I wear they for a extend period of walk . however , the strap stretch out and the foot bed compress down so they loosen up and really do become very comfortable . if you can deal with a couple uncomfortable day at first in exchange for -lrb- hopefully -rrb- a few year of solid comfort , go ahead and pick a pair up .
Sandal	POS	5	he wear out he first pair -lrb- but it take a couple of year of hard wear on the boat and dock -rrb- . he even duct tape they together until I could get he replacement - would not wear different sandal . this time I buy a spare pair !
Sandal	NEU	3	wow , just like the coral you hear so much about , the reef shoe be shrink . since 1996 this style have shrink about 2 size , and get narrower . I have a 13 foot and wear size 12 reef back in the 90 's when thing be generous . but then after after 911 they seem a bit smaller so I go for the size 13 which be just a little bigger . just now I buy the 13 and they be 1\/2 inch narrower and shorter than the previous 13 's so it look like I will need a size 14 . WTF ?!? its not some supermarket consumable item that get smaller and smaller be it ? I mean its a shoe ? I mean the size be the same right ? Whats next ? a 42 inch tv that be actually 39 inch ? what about hat , be they shrink ? Whats go on when the shoe size shrink a entire inch in 15 year ? `` ok we need to increase profit , let make the shoe smaller '' its still a good well build flip flop , but they be make in china now , be that the answer ?
Sandal	NEG	1	the last pair of keen sandal I buy , for my wife and I , be thoroughly appreciate as to durabilty and comfort , but say to say , the one we order this time be inferior in every respect . the size be mark the same , unfortunately they appear to be mean for child . the material be overly lightweight and strange , definetly unlike the one we have buy originally , which be make in the USA . Yours truly , Dennis Mora
Sandal	POS	5	hand down the most comfortable sandal out of the box I have ever worn . they go well with anything and be comfortable and easy to walk in as well as easy to clean . just a great sandal all around .
Sandal	POS	5	I have have Birks for 20 yr and these be the first that I have have that have the soft in-sole . I love 'em , superkawika
Sandal	POS	5	these shoe be no longer available in store . when I recently go on the timberland website , I find out that they no longer make this shoe . the only one available appear to be whatever be leave in the Amazon.com seller ' stock . I buy a pair of these about 5 year ago at Dillards , and they be the most comfortable shoe I have ever own until I finally wear they out . I just get a new pair and use mink oil to soften they up . it work great .
Sandal	POS	5	the Clark 's man 's Hudson Sandal I purchase be the most comfortable and versitile footwear I have own in a long time . my wife swear by Clark 's and now I do too . they can be wear with or without the backstrap , which be removable , the footbed be leather and the sole absorb you stride . I do not know they make man 's product until I do a search on Amazon.com . my highest praise .
Sandal	POS	4	very comfortable . arrive quicker than I expect . price be right . you can not ask for anything more than that unless they be free .
Sandal	POS	5	great shoe , but if you be look at these you already know that . I buy a off color because they be the cheapest here on Amazon , but they be the best color anyway . go figure . so shop around here , amazing the small difference in price . I have a wide foot and they fit I fine , seem to be true in size .
Sandal	POS	5	I highly recommend this product . it look good and feel good . a extremely comfortable sandal . I normally do not bother do review , however this product be really worth it .
Sandal	POS	5	my foot love they right out of the box ! you can take off the heel strap and use they for `` slip on '' but for `` off road '' use the heel strap .
Sandal	POS	4	love the sandal except for one thing : I find the toe strap -lrb- make of leather -rrb- to be relatively wide and stiff , therefore somewhat uncomfortable . it be possible the strap will soften and\/or my toe will toughen up as they break in . -lrb- my foot be pretty sensitive . -rrb- they be quite comfortable otherwise though , and very well make .
Sandal	POS	5	I have a pair of they and wear they out finally they start make they again . they be the same in look and comfort
Sandal	POS	5	Have have these shoe for several week now , great boat shoe , beefy enough you can put you foot down on that big snapper that be flip around in the back of the boat and feel that you foot will be protect . no scuff mark in the boat . Great for wade fishing , I walk out into the grass bed here in the intercoastal of the Florida panhandle and these shoe be work great . Easy on and off , dry pretty fast . I have a pair of speedo water shoe before these , they stink . the eyelet in the speedo have all rust and be pull through , spend the money and get a better pair with these keen .
Sandal	POS	4	I love birkenstock sandal . let 's just say that right off the bat . I love these shoe . they feel so good on my foot . when I can find these shoe on sale , I buy they . if I can not , I buy Betula Sandals ... very similar ... same feel . well , I see these advertise as my favorite shoe with a soft footbed , which I have never have before . so , I buy they . sorry , footbed feel the same to I . that be my only complaint . it be not worth the extra $ 20.00 . other than that ... a great shoe .
Sandal	NEG	1	the high and very hard arch be not right for I . I would not recommend unless you can try it on in a store to see if it be right for you .
Sandal	POS	5	very comfortable and durable especially on the inside of the shoe . these be replace a identical pair worn frequently for 6 year .
Sandal	POS	5	great sandal ! I have have mine for 4 year , and they be comfortable , durable and reasonably price . I have put mine through quite a bit of wear . Beach camping , camp shoe for backpacking , every day wear as a student , etc. . they handle all of it . as far as the smell go , in my experience the leather version smell worse than the hemp , but like any footwear where sock be not worn , there can be some odor .
Sandal	POS	5	this the one of the few fragrance that I truly love and it layer well with my favorite perfume . from what I have be tell the reason why Body & Bath do not have this fragrance in stock at time be because Sandalwood have become so rare and it be hard for they to get the fragrance at a reasonable price .
Sandal	POS	4	I love these sandal . - they be very rugged . - the snug , secure fit over the foot and around the ankle pair with the unique toe space -lrb- see caveat below -rrb- match my preferred fit for a shoe . - the foot bed have just that right amount of cushion and comfort while still feel solid and stable . they really hit the `` magic '' mix on this . - the bolster around the heel and arch eliminate side to side movement create a very stable feel about these shoe . - the hybrid nature of these shoe cause I to reach for they far more often than my sandal or hiking\/walking shoe . have you ever try to run in sandal ? how long do it take to dry hike shoe after a wade ? now to my small caveat : 1 . it may be just that I have a abnormally tall big-toe , but I could stand just one more millimeter of space in the toe well over the top . in fact , the first time I buy a pair of these , I have to return they after a couple day because my toenail just-barely touch the top of the toe well and make I nut . eventually I find a pair that have just that tiny bit of extra space and I snatch they up . this bring I to my second caveat . 2 . you would not expect it , but the size variation across style and even within the same style be pretty significant . I be sure I would never be able to own a pair of keen because of the toe fit thing . when I find they on sale recently , I decide to have another try . to my surprise , I find a pair of original Newport in 10.5 -lrb- my size -rrb- that fit awesome with no toe problem ... but they be leather , which I do not want , and they be just the most ridiculous light green color . next I try the h2 with nylon strap . the first 10.5 be way too small , for fun I try two other 10.5 s , all of which feel like they be different size . then I try a 11 . these be too big by a long-shot . I be ready to leave when I try a 11.5 on a whim and they fit perfectly ... I think you need to try these shoe on before you buy . I buy everything I can online , but in the case of keen shoe , I would be really hesitant .
Sandal	POS	5	the double layer sandal definitely have more support than the single layer . better choice and definitely worth the extra few buck . the `` break in '' time be about a week . it be not too bad the `` break in '' time as some of the other reviewer have say but after it mold to you foot , they be very comfortable and will only get better with time and usage . the strap be tight in the beginning . the size do run a bit small . I wear a size 9 man medium and order a medium -lrb- 8.5 - 9.5 -rrb- and it fit the length of my foot barely , but if I order the next size up , in the long run , it will look a bit too big . like other say , if in doubt , order the next size up . the sandal be narrow and will be tight the first few time you wear they but will be worth it . Mine be so comfortable and I have be wear they every time I step out the door . I walk my dog in they , run errand in time , go everywhere with they . I buy color gray and sierra brown . if you like the sierra brown color , I would suggest order the dark brown color because with wear and tear and footprint , the dark brown will not be as noticeable when it get dirty as the sierra brown .
Sandal	POS	5	I love these flip flop . they take a little while to break in but they be so nice . they have a good amount of arch support which be rare for flip flop , they also be very durable and be mean to last . I believe the company will even replace the top layer if it ever get damage -lrb- the Rainbow company not the store that be sell these flip flop -rrb- , definitely worth the money .
Sandal	POS	5	keen sandal shoe be great for everything . I already have a pair so we order these for my husband . he love they too . they be not you ordinary man 's sandal . they let you foot breath and the sole be make from non absorbent material which be sweat proof . they be good for hike and water activity as well as everyday wear . great product all around !
Sandal	POS	5	this be my first birky and I love they . highly recommend they for we sandalfoot . well craft and comfortable as all hell . would definitely puchase again .
Sandal	POS	5	this be avery comfortable shoe that you can wear all day . I would recommend this shoe over the loose slip-on and off sandal or flip-flop . you will have as much support as you can get from a close in shoe . I love mine !
Sandal	NEG	1	I buy a pair of these exact same shoe -lrb- size 10 -rrb- 2 year ago . they last two whole year and be still very wearable . I have just wear the tread off . I order a new pair with great confidence , and wait for delivery . that be where the pro end . the pair I receive in the mail be MUCH MUCH smaller , and two different size ! the left one do fit , very tightly , but I figure it be because they be new . the right one do not fit at all . I compare they to each other and the two shoe be different size . they be both marked US size 10 . I then compare they to the old one that be considerably larger and also marked US size 10 . my old one be also mark as make in the U.S.A. and the new one be from china . I call a friend that have also recently buy a pair of keen shoe from REI.com . they be two small for he as well , and he say one be smaller than the other ... keen , what have happen ? you go from AWESOME to lame in two year ? I will not be buy anymore keen product anytime soon . I have return these shoe to amazon , and can not review these as positive in any way .
Sandal	POS	5	we order these shoe , they be what my husband want . we receive they before time promise . completely satisfy .
Sandal	POS	5	this be my second pair of these sandle . they be smart look , extremely comfortable , and durable . wear barefoot with shorts or wear with sock for jeans or slacks . thank you , Timberland !
Sandal	POS	4	I purchase these for my husband . he have a pair like they year ago and want another pair . he say the adissage piece be hurt he foot more than massage they so we scrape those off of the shoe and he wear they all of the time now .
Sandal	POS	4	I order the woman 's Keen Newport h2 in the aqua haze\/brittany blue color . the actual color I receive be closer to the process Blue . these be Way brighter . I be expect a more muted blue . aside from the misrepresentation of color , -lrb- maybe it be my computer screen -rrb- the sandal be great ! I normally wear a size 8m , they fit perfectly , but I be a short , wider 8m , so those of slender foot be warn . you can however adjust the fit a little with the elastic tie . they be also very comfortable . not disappointing .
Sandal	POS	5	I receive these shoe very quickly and be really pleased with this product ... only one word of warn when order any birkenstock make sure you order the correct width as most of the range come in a wide width and slim width . I have a very narrow foot and these arrive as a slim fit and fit perfectly . would purchase from this vendor again pain free and no hassle ... thank you
Sandal	POS	5	my husband say : wear they daily . nice arch support , my heel fall in the center rather than on the left side , all in all the best flip flop I have ever have on my foot and I have try they all , Tevas , Rainbows , you name it .
Sandal	POS	4	product arrive on time as promise . color be good . it will require a lot of break in since it seem stiffer than other sandal plus the toe splitter seem to pinch some .
Sandal	POS	5	excellent sandal that can be worn anywhere . plus that , it last forever ! this be my second pair and i rate it top shelf .
Sandal	POS	4	at first I think spend this much money for a pair of sandle be normally not I . I would rather go to Walmart and get a pair of $ 25 special to last I a few month but the pickings be limit here on Guam -lrb- and no Walmart . a Kmart but no Walmart -rrb- I think I give `` online '' shop a try . I find these keen on Amazon and base my choice due to the color to be honest ... man 's blue yellow fade represent the Navy Colors . so I take a gamble and spend so-so money for these shoe and since they arrive I have wear they everyday . they that comfortable . the next time I need sandle I be go keen again . sorry Walmart .
Sandal	POS	5	absolutely awesome h2o sandal ! I buy my Keen Newport H2o 's in 2005 to go on a trip to Costa Rica for 14 day . I be in sand , rock , mud , muck , lava rock , the ocean , river , everything in between , and they perform flawlessly . Easy to Clean , Lightweight , durable , great support , Great Protection , H2o Friendly . I still wear they every spring and summer and they be hold up very well . there be absolutely no separation that I can see anywhere on they , other than `` 1 string '' that go around the side patch where the keen logo be located . and as far as the toe guard go ... it be extremely Tuff . if you smack you toe against a rock , it just bounce right back . you might feel a vibration of course , but I honestly never hurt any toe in these shoe ... -lrb- knock on wood -rrb- . I would not be surprise if these last another 3 to 5 yr , but by then I will have buy a nice new pair of Keens : -rrb- highly recommend !!
Sandal	POS	5	I have worn these sandal extensively and they be very comfortable and appear to be very well construct . the first thing I notice after purchase they be the weight , they be a bit heavier than you average sandal but still very easy to wear . keep in mind the sandal be white and dirt will show up easily if you be not careful . overall a great product .
Sandal	POS	5	there be allot of different vendor for birkenstock on Amazon and , in my opinion , ya get to be careful that you be get real leather instead of the Birkobuc fake leather . I have leather birk that be over ten year old and still go strong . these be real , black leather birk and I pay $ 77.00 for they . fast free shipping and a trouble free transaction . highly recommend Amazon and Birkenstock .
Sandal	NEU	3	the fit be a little tight . but the length of the sole fit my foot so I hope the ankle strap stretch over time . the size run small so get a half size down . I be usually a 10 but the newport i have before and these h2 be 9.5 . see customer pic of my 7 year old leather newport on Amazon . happy with the color but the material seem way cheaper and thinner than I have expect . not supprise since every other chinese product I buy keep get cheaper or crappier . and what happen in most company 's quality control dept ?!? do they even exist anymore ?
Sandal	POS	5	this my second pair of Birkenstock sandal in the last 6 month . these sandal be so comfortable that I buy another pair so I would have a spare pair . I be over 65 year old and I hate that I be just experience the comfort of Birkenstock . I wear a narrow in shoe and the birkenstock narrow be great ! love the comfort of the soft footbed . highly recommend !
Sandal	POS	5	these sandal like other rainbow sandal be amazing . I have have my original pair for several year . it take a little bit of time but after a little bit of time they conform to you foot .
Sandal	POS	4	while the footbed be well shaped and give good support to the arch , I be disappoint that there be not more `` give '' in the sole . it remind I of the wooden Dr. scholl sandal I use to wear in college . now , all these year later , I have a achy knee ligament , and these sandal do not do much to absorb the shock of a footfall , especially on concrete or asphalt . my foot love they , but my knee do not .
Sandal	POS	5	this be my second pair of ` bo . no sandal in the world like 'em . you will never know till you wear they . supplier be quick to deliver and as state in the listing .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy one pair and they be so comfortable and good look that I immediately purchase a second pair which I get today . do not know how well they will wear but I have never have a problem with timberland
Sandal	POS	5	big fan of the flop . give they a little wear and they form to you foot perfectly . very glad about this purchase .
Sandal	POS	5	light weight , durable , great toe protection and quick on\/off . never own a pair of Keens , Teevas or any type of sandal like this so I can not compare it to other but this particular one be a recommend . I usually wear 9.5 and the 9 fit perfect with a little room .
Sandal	POS	4	i be worry about the way the sandal look in the picture since they round up , but ddint effect walk or anything . very comfortable my boyfriend say . he like they a lot !
Sandal	NEG	1	give this as a gift think it would be a sturdy and well make alternative to the cheapo flip-flop . manage to tear up my boyfriend foot - try to break they in all summer to no avail . they be just really not flexible and whatever they be make of rub on skin the wrong way . a waste of money .
Sandal	POS	4	great product . they fit well and very comfortable . I will be buy addition pair to make sure I have they in the future
Sandal	POS	5	these flop be a little more money BUT worth be , my other half go thru 2\/3 cheap pair a season or they break apart , he be on the 2nd summer and still go strong ! when these wear out he will be get a third pair . I get 2 last year because I never think they would hold up I be wrong ! he say they be comfy and still feel good on he foot !!! thanks Rainbow !!! you will be he flop of choice from now on !!!
