Vacuum	POS	4	this vacuum , because it be cordless , only run for a few minute before the battery be out . not much of a problem for I , as my family mainly use this to vacuum the car once in a while , but could definitely be a problem for people who think this would be a compact solution to clean they home . I have yet to be disappoint with the suction power of this vacuum , and can get it into most of the nook and cranny in my car . I be guilty of snack as I drive , especially when stick in traffic , and I be also a bit of a messy eater so there be almost always crumb and rogue cracker in my car . I love use this to vacuum the floor of my car because of its compact size , and I can easily move it from the front seat to back .
Vacuum	POS	5	I purchase this item mainly for my car but this little vacuumed work great anywhere . the only thing it need be to add a charger for the car . I use the one I have for my car , it really have some great power for such a little vacuumed . it be great to clean up minor spill , cookie crumb , etc. . I also use it in the house to get down between the cushion to get crumb up . it have many use . it be small enough to put in a purse , camera bag , laptop case , etc. . it work great to clean in between the computer key and pick 's up dust very well . I would recommend this product to everyone and it also make a great gift for that person who you do not know what to get they . the price be good also . give yourself a treat and get one . you will not be dissatisfy with it . I do not work for the company or Amazon . Carolyn Salt Lake City , Ut .
Vacuum	POS	5	I just get a new car and I be a ocd clean freak etc. . it do a excellent job cleaning my car . this mini vacuum be the perfect size and very powerful . I have not find any con .
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy a Eureka vacuum as I have have my previous Eureka for 30 year . I have have other -lrb- Kenmore -rrb- as well during this period , and they all have problem . thus far , my new one have be terrific . I hope it continue .
Vacuum	POS	4	I love this little vac . it be easy to use and store out of the way . I use it on my stair , kitchen floor , and foyer . I be pleasantly surprise with the out come ; it be just what I be look for . the only downside for I be have to empty it . it be a little awkward have to hold it over the trash to empty while the lid try to close . I think if the lid stay open while be empty it would be much better . that con be very small in comparison to what you gain from this vac .
Vacuum	POS	5	I absolutely adore this little gem . besides be just as cute as can be , it be perfect for my small apartment . the charge last long enough for I to do what I need to and if it do get low I can plug it in and continue vacuuming . the cord be quite long and be perfect for those hard to reach place . I love mine !
Vacuum	POS	5	I order the Hoover brand type y replacement bag for my Hoover vacuum cleaner . they cost a little more than some generic type y bag , but I think it be worth it to buy the manufacturer 's bag to ensure a proper fit . the bag opening attach to the vacuum cleaner port and the bag have to have a immediate 90 degree bend to fit inside the enclosure . a previous bag not make by Hoover seem to fit poorly and some debris would collect inside the vacuum cleaner without reach the bag . since I have these Hoover bag , I have not experience that problem , so it seem to be worth a few cent more . shipment be very prompt .
Vacuum	NEU	3	great vacuum , really do a great job pick up the dirt , but it be a little heavy for the elderly . would recommend it for younger people .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be so glad I buy the Eureka 4870mz Boss Smart-Vac with the pet paw ! oh my goodness , it perform much better than my previous , much more expensive , vaccum ! it clean so incredibly well - great suction . and the powerpaw and hose be extremely powerful as well ! I have review vaccum for month before pick this one and boy do I ever make the right choice ! it be the same heaviness as any heavy-duty vaccum . I finally make a good-buy !!!
Vacuum	POS	5	read a number of review of different vacuum from various site . this one seem to have the right combination of quality and performance - even though the price be a bit higher than you average vacuum . we have not be disappoint . just unpack it you can immediately tell it be a quality product and well design . it be much more powerful than the Oreck upright we be replace - and amazingly quiet . it be also very easy to use and maneuver - the body easily `` twist '' to make tight turn , and also lay flat to get under bed , etc. . the attachment it come with be fine , but we do wind up also buy a `` parquet floor '' brush attachment , as we have a fair amount of hardwood floor . there be several similar model of this vacuum - all seem to have the same motor , just different `` auto feature '' , etc. . also this model come with a filter , but NOT a hepa filter . a new filter be include in each order of replacement bag . my understanding be that you can replace the `` standard '' filter w \/ a hepa if desire . I think on some of the more expensive model , the hepa come standard . the only slight negative , mention by several other , be that this vacuum be a bit heavier than we previous -lrb- and I assume than average vac -rrb- . this only come into play when carry it around - not in operation . we do not find it a problem at all for we usage , and we have three level to deal with . just want to include that comment in case it be a issue for other . overall a excellent vacuum that I believe will serve we very well for many year . definitely a case of you get what you pay for - imo it be well worth it .
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy this after get feed up with empty my canister vacuum and suck dust , and who know what else , each time . I just could not quantify spending as much money as I do only to inhale everything I would just clean out of my house . the end result be that I vacuum less when the canister begin to get on the full side because I hate the idea of have to empty it . so that be why I buy it in the first place . as soon as I take it out of the box I be pretty thrill with the purchase . all of the accessory attach to the unit securely and I have not have a single piece pop off on it be own even when lug it up stair , down stair , and put it in the back of my car . at the same time they be easy to put on and take off when you want . the only slight exception may be the power paw and the ` wide ' attachment for the hose . I have not have any problem with they but I can see how they might cause problem . the power paw be the least securely attach and the wide attachment be the most securely attach and slightly cover by the cord when wind up . pro : where do I start ? 1 -rrb- it be powerful . this be easily one of the most powerful vacuum I have ever use . it suck the litter right out of my litter-catcher-rug that I have in front of we cat box . I use to have to shake the rug out and vacuum the litter off the tile , but now I just pop on the wide attachment for the hose and go to town . 2 -rrb- it have as all the most practical attachment include plus the power paw . this pro be just about standard . all vacuum should come with the primary attachment and this one do and they throw in the power paw which be really great for stair ... just like they advertise it to be . as for the power paw , it rotate via suction . I have a bagless with this attachment and it would lose suction so quickly -lrb- pet hair in the filter -rrb- that this attachment be useless . on this vacuum the power paw be like a freak chainsaw no matter how much hair it suck up . 3 -rrb- it be easy and fast to switch from floor to hose setting and back again . I can literally go from vacuum the floor to use the hose in 5 seconds or less and I can go from vacuum the floor to use the hose with any attachment + the extension in 10 seconds or less and it only take very slightly longer to put it all back and continue vacuum the floor . go be the day for I that I do all my floor vacuum and then follow up with the hose . now I can do everything in one pass . 4 -rrb- the floor brush can be engaged\/disengaged with the flick of a switch for easy transition from carpet to bare floor . this be the first vacuum I have own that I can do this on and I will never go back ! vacuum bare floor while the brush be spin be like ... well ... it just do not work . all it do be turn everything on the floor into tiny projectile that be launch at my foot and shin . be able to turn off the brush ... it be one of those , `` finally ! '' moment for I . what I mean be , I can finally just use the vacuum on my bare floor instead of the vacuum\/broom combo . I use to sweep the bare floor up then follow up with the vacuum to get all the corner the the broom could not clear . now , because of this feature and # 3 , just the vacuum , easy peasy . 5 -rrb- it have a hepa filter that be easy to access for removal and installation . I have not have to replace it yet but I do open it up and remove it and install it just to see what it be like . Super easy . 6 -rrb- it have a light on the base for dark corner . this be good for unlit or not-well-lit area of the room . personally , I have find this more of a novelty than something I would require in a future vacuum purchase . 7 -rrb- the bag be easy to remove and install . again , this be just about standard . the last bagged vacuum I have be a soft top -lrb- the bag be inside of a zippered bag -rrb- so it be ridiculous to get the bag out and put it back it . it be the vacuum that put I off bagged vacuum . I go to canister and do not go back until now ... over a decade later . 8 -rrb- wide track . this be just a convenient feature . wider track = less pass . I have not , as of yet , have any situation where it be too wide to fit somewhere I need it to . 9 -rrb- it be a bagged vacuum . like I say on # 7 , I have be use bagless\/canister vacuum for over a decade now . I finally get so feed up with the dust cloud when empty they and tap out the filter so I would not have to spend another $ 20 so soon . I even make a special tool so that I could attach my filter to my drill and spin the dust that be pack so tightly in there out with centrifugal force . this , obviously , just make the dust cloud during canister empty worse but if I want the vacuum to have any suction it be necessary . even then , I would lose suction steadily as I suck up the cat hair . since I do not feel like dish out $ 300 - $ 600 for a canister vacuum that `` never lose suction '' yet still deal with the cloud of nasty when I empty the canister I buy this bagged vacuum . there be still the bit of dust that poof up when you detach the bag from the vacuum and there be a possibility of dust that puff out if you compress the bag but nowhere near the amount of a canister . if you be careful , there be no dust cloud at all , which be freak awesome . no more dust mask and goggles for I while empty canister ! 10 -rrb- last minute addition after write in my con . there be a second handle low on the vacuum for carry up stair . it make it so much easier to handle ... no pun intend . con : 1 -rrb- it be loud , as with every other vacuum I have ever own . not really a true con as all vacuum be loud but it be still advisory to wear hearing protection when use it . 2 -rrb- it be kind of heavy . this be not a con for I but my wife have some trouble with it when it come to stair . 3 -rrb- the handle be not as comfortable as it could be . although not entirely uncomfortable it be not as nice as some of they other model . 4 -rrb- the light on the base be not quite as bright as it could be . at first I think that it would be a really great feature but it be not quite bright enough to make a significant difference in visibility in my opinion . they could have put a much brighter system in here quite easily . Hope this help you with you decision !
Vacuum	NEU	3	it be not a bad vacuum for the price but I would not recommend anyone pay more than $ 79.00 . the hand attachment be actually pretty cool and work well on `` dog hair in the couch '' problem . I be really disappoint with the edge suction -- they be wrong to say there even be such a thing . I end up do all the edge task by hand -lrb- or broom -rrb- .
Vacuum	POS	5	I purchase a previous version of the 4870 -lrb- dark green -rrb- a couple of year ago . the newer model have only minor difference . note to dad and husband : think of it as a power tool ! I will echo the other comment on great suction and somewhat heavy weight . this be a excellent combination of power and price , but you may want to think twice if you be a smaller person who would need to carry the cleaner up and down stair a lot . I have laminate floor so the brush control be mandatory ; that feature be hard to find on other model in this price range . so far I have have two year of good service with no problem . the control for the brush and the hose suction could be more intuitive but I get use to they quickly . from other review , apparently people have have trouble with the bare floor toggle . in my experience , if you try to set the toggle before you unlock the handle , the toggle will fall back to the carpet setting and the carpet brush will keep turn ... which negate the whole point of the toggle . however , mine work fine if you set the rotary height adjustment knob to `` bare floor '' and then use the foot pedal to unlock the handle . at this point you can easily move the toggle from `` carpet '' to `` bare floor '' and it will click into place , stop the brush . yes , it be more hassle than it need to be but rapidly become second nature , and the cleaner do a grear job on my laminate floor .
Vacuum	POS	5	I purchase this as a gift for my daughter . she have 2 dog and 2 child and she be very happy with its performance .
Vacuum	NEU	3	just think I would let you know the vacuum be worth $ 200.00 do not pay any more then that , it be make in the U.S.A. which be its strongest selling point . the second be that it really suck and work great , but there be absolutely , no extra or any whistle as per say , so if you just need a good vacuum cleaner , this be it . remember you can purchase it easy for $ 200. , on line , this be a commercial vacuum cleaner , so do not pay any more then $ 200. , this be a super light and easy vacuum cleaner , but it be all plastic and light . some people say it be loud , it be but it work good , maybe even great .
Vacuum	POS	5	I receive this vacuum a couple of week ago . it really work well . I have ceramic tiling thoughout the house except the bedroom . it work on both surface well . initially I find it hard to push , but with time I find it be a lot easier . I be most happy with this vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	5	Works well ... have 5 dog , have back surgery , fill in the gap nicely between maid visit ... get the correct replacement filter
Vacuum	NEG	2	it start out well but putter out after only a year . it be cheap but you would have to buy a new one yearly . that be a waist of resource and I hate the `` make it cheap and make it not last '' business practice . I replace the bag regularly , replace the filter but it just have poor pick-up and that be the whole point of a vacuum . when you have to run over the thing you can see 3-4 time to get it , how many thing that can not be see be be leave every time you vacuum ?! this replace a Dyson -lrb- that last year ! -rrb- and will be replace by a Dyson .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this thing be wonderful for the first three year . I recall tell my wife when I first fire it up , `` we can actually have a conversation with this thing run '' . my only immediate complaint be that it do not do the greatest job with edge cleaning . otherwise , it be not be a bad vacuum consider it be be use daily for over 2,700 day straight -lrb- 5 child to clean after -rrb- . over-all : good suction , handle well , change only 3-4 belt , contain dirt very well with hepa filter , change lightbulb only once . here 's my experience with quality issue -lrb- heavy use , but not abuse -rrb- : year 1 : no problem year 2 : auto brush stop fail when vacuum be upright , but can still manually stop with lever . notice that it be not as quiet as at first -lrb- rattle and buzz -rrb- . year 3 : replace hose attachment due to nozzle end chip and crack . Flex hose leak . year 4 : replaced lightbulb . notice powercord insullation easily become chew if accidently run over cord . year 5 : quite loud now , but no noticable performance difference since new . year 6 : will not stay upright unless you adjust the yellow release pedal to lock in . there be be a few `` ouch '' with my wife and kid . year 7 : Power switch no longer work , the belt tension arm have weaken and the roller brush just ramp up and down -lrb- even with a new belt -rrb- . hose and nozzle need to be replace again , powercord and the roller brush should be replace ... time for a new vacuum . be the above acceptable for a $ 160 vacuum ? I guess , but quite frankly , I would be willing to spend a few more buck on a vacuum that get I out to 10yr and have better quality in plastic part and do not get louder with time and give I better edge suction . if it mean alot more money , this vacuum be probably hit the sweet spot . I consider give this 4 star , but decide on 3 as I be not really sure if it be above average with regard to wear and tear for this price point . I hope this help you buying decision .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I spend a lot of time research vacuum and decide that we would buy this . I purchase it about 4 month ago . I realize that if I have purchase a $ 400 vacuum I probably would not have these issue , but we can not afford that . this vacuum do as all do and vacumm up the everyday dirt , but there be some issue I want to make sure other buyer be aware of prior to they purchase this product . the only good thing I have notice be that the one attachment -lrb- not the Pet -rrb- work great on pet hair . better than my old Dirt Devil . if you do not mind my frustration outline below , then you will be happy with you purchase . my issue : 1 . the filter be horrible to clean and unless you clean they there be no suction . you have to clean two area and one do not remove from the vacuum so be almost impossible to clean . the filter itself be make of two section , a foam outer section and the inner filter . the only way to get it really clean be to wash it which be what the instruction say to do after every use . -lrb- which in itself be a pain . I have decide that it work fine to do every other time or so . -rrb- the issue be it take forever for the inner filter to dry . so make sure you have vacuum everything you need to prior to wash otherwise you can not use you vacuum with a wet filter . this happen to I , I realize I miss a large area and have to wait to vacuum it , and it make I really mad . 2 . if you be buy this for the PET ATTACHMENT , do not . I try to use it and the attachment lock up and will not spin . have be unable to remedy and the tool be useless . 3 . my old vacuum have a way to shut off spin brush when use the hand attachment and I miss that . every time I use the hand tool I have to angle the vacuum so that it do not ruin my carpet . 4 . the HAND ATTACHMENT hose do not go very far at all . you have to keep the machine close to where ever you be use it . like I say earilier , it work well for the price , but just be aware of the frustration to use it . if you do clean the filter properly it do have decent suction and work well . happy Shopping !
Vacuum	POS	5	we have be use the Miele brand bag for several year but as the price continue to increase and the quantity in the box decrease decide to give these bag a try . we be very pleased ; the bag itself be good quality , the collar be cardboard instead of plastic . Update 2012 : the most recent shipment be not the EnviroCare brand , even though that be what the photo show , but DVC brand . the bag state it come with 2 different filter but none be inside . the EnviroCare brand seem to be of slightly higher quality .
Vacuum	POS	5	this product vacuum and pick up quite well . it be somewhat heavy , but heavy be good because hold to the floor , et al. . my wife delegate I to operate this . fold-up to store , clean : require a little dexterity , and in clean out the accumulate , it be best hold over a waste basket . there be two filter , which should be `` service '' . filter keep air clean . pleased with the purchase , the vacuum be solid in consturction . it be good value , engineer well . .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be very pleased with this product . it be powerful , easy to maneuver , and empty be a breeze . be able to clean the filter save on cost . I highly recommend this vacuum if you want convenience and power .
Vacuum	POS	5	receive the Hoover on time . price be very fair . the vacuum have work perfectly since it arrive . we use it for stair and hardword floor and dust . also useful for we car . it take a little get use to use since it have no wheel and you carry it . however it be light weight make the carry very easy . you can get to almost anywhere you need to because of the extra long cord . the cord length be a real plus . the vacuum be strong and the attachment work very well . the Portapower be well make and use good attachment . I would purchase the vacuum again .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have get generic vac bag before and they be just paper . Fine . I be not that particular and the Miele bag be so expensive . I order these figure they be just paper but they be the `` cloth '' type just like the OEM . very pleased .
Vacuum	POS	5	this product really do the job . good vacuum and versitile as far as rug type and floor to vacuum . look to be durable and be easy to handle .
Vacuum	POS	5	I struggle with whether to give this unit 4 or 5 star . I be lean toward 4 because I find the hose incredibly awkward because it want to stick out prominently to the side while vacuum . this cause I to sweep a very special coffee mug off which shatter on the floor . I try to pay more attention but end up catch another glass shortly thereafter . you really have to be careful when you be use this thing because the hose extend about 2 foot to you side and will hook anything in its way such as lamp , glass , painting , etc. . at the end of the day i decide to give it 5 star because it truly be a magnificent vacuum . it do exactly what it be suppose to do . it be a light weight vacuum with tremendous suction and a long power cord . I will take responsibility for the learning curve and not penalize the device . I want to mention one other thing in relation to the weight . I have read that it be heavy . I be a fairly large guy so I wonder whether other people might find it uncomfortable . my 9 year old son follow I around the house when I first get the unit , beg for a chance to try it . I eventually give in and he use it for 15-20 minute and never once complain about the weight . he be only 75 lb , so if he can wield it , I think most adult would be able to do so comfortably .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I check out this vaccuum on consumer report which be the reason I buy it . well , to my disappointment it be the WORST vaccuum I have ever own . not only be it clumsy to use with the hose continuously fall off , but it burn my carpet whenever I use the hose . I do NOT lean on it or push it forward as it warn on page 7 of the warranty ; the vaccuum would singe the carpet just sit upright even after 10 seconds of use the hose . what a extremely poorly engineer vaccuum . what I be really surprised about be even if someone be to barely lean on it , a vaccuum should never burn you carpet . how can they even put this product on the market ?!!!
Vacuum	POS	5	this product be the best we have find for what its make for . we live in a Motor home and its the best for a quick clean and it clean very well . BUT , you have to follow the direction . to clean sweeper after each use , dump cup , and keep the filter clean ! if you let it charge for 18 hour before use , we vacuum we whole 40 foot motor home on one charge .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be sick and tired of the bagless , the mess , dust and use my air compresser to blow out all part of my Dyson canister . I really think this eureka out clean and be cleaner all around for a fraction of the cost .
Vacuum	POS	4	the vacuum do exactly what I want it to do . it be portable , and the hose feature be perfect for I . however , the vacuum be a bit noisey . other than the noise , I really like the product a lot . I would recommend it to anyone that be not concern about the noise .
Vacuum	POS	5	I use it on all flooring surface in my home . buy it to replace a dirt devil cordless vacuum , this be by far a better vac .
Vacuum	POS	4	I love this vacuum , however , it be too heavy and bulky for my 2 story house . pro : twist feature be great , easy to unpack and set up , super long cord , great suction , beautiful to look at . con : Heavy & bulky . could not vacuum the stair with it at all . do not seem to work very well on ceramic floor -lrb- would not vacuum up the paper clip I sprinkle on the floor -rrb- . best use : one story house with lot of carpet , otherwise consider a Miele canister vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	until someone can email I at cloudninesterling@hotmail.com or reply to this comment and tell I how they could rate this anything over a `` I hate it '' , I refuse to believe other be rate the correct product . I have have this vacuum for a year and have re-try it about a dozen time . no matter what setting I put it on -lrb- from bare floor up to high carpet -rrb- it simply do not pick up debris from the few carpet I have in my home . this vacuum do not work . I throw mine in the dumpster today . Mary Jennifer Pruim Age 43 Chicago , il
Vacuum	POS	5	i be search for a replacement for my kenmore cannister that lose its ooomph . after research consumer report i be just about set to buy the eureka 8340 series which be one of the top rate . after further research i find waay too many negative review in term of reliability and quality . make I wonder how this unit be top rate in the first place . one of the review mention the carpet pro series . it be supposedly make by the same folk as simplicity and ricarr . i have access to the simplicity upright and love it . after search the internet i find the best deal at allbrand direct . for $ 250 no shipping chg , they include 3 belt , 2 filter ,7 pc accesory set-15ft hose - bare floor , upholstery , ceiling , crevice tool and 2 extension . this be a great deal especially since i have stair to do . as for the unit itself = i buy the cpu-2t - 40ft heavy duty cord and 3 attachment - since i get sloppy and tend to run over the cord once in a while i think it be best to get this model - the 1t model have a light ,30 ft 2prong cord and no attachment . i have several pet - 3 cat and 2 dog and hair hair hair . i purposely leave one of my carpet alone until i get this unit . Dont let the 10amp motor turn you off - as soon as i plug this in and turn it on , it practically drag I across the room - its not self propel but the brush be so good it literally will feel like its pull you . basically in 1-2 pass the room be clean in 3 minute app 10x12 . no effort be need to push and pull it . it be 18 lb and i have no problem carry it up the stair where it quickly dispose on loose kitty litter . it also have its own build in resettable fuse if the unit overheat due to clog or full bag . although there be no bad full indicator , from past experience you ; ll know the bag be full when you look at the carpet . I be totally please with this unit . its not overly loud in my opinion . forget all those bargain deal and buy this unit . this might be you last vacuum purchase , even though other unit be 15 inch , you 'll make it up with speed .
Vacuum	POS	4	this vacuum work much better than we last bagless vacuum . it do clean the floor well , bare and carpet . the con be that be very heavy and the hose be short . to vacuum my step I have to do half with the vacuum at the top of the step and half from the bottom .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have allergy to just about everything , paticularly dust . I have switch my upright to the Oreck use the hypoallergenic bag . the upright I use originally seem to be do the job , however , ten minute after vacuumm I notice dust particle settle on the furniture and everywhere else . shortly thereafter I have a migraine . since I switch to the Oreck , I no longer have to dust everything after vacuumm and have reduce my allergy symptom significantly . the Oreck contain the dust particle in the hypoallergenic bag , be light weight and flexible enough to vaccum in tight area . love it , love it , love it !!!
Vacuum	POS	5	these bag be hard to find and really expensive most place , save a lot of money and time purchase online .
Vacuum	POS	4	it be compact , easy to clean out , and handy . not terribly impressive on either wood floor or carpet , but for the price , it be gist fine . I have a tough time clean the hair -lrb- we have longish stuff in we home -rrb- out of the roller bar . interesting idea : wash the filter clean after dump out the stuff collect - very green . not sure how long it 'll last . a relative have have one for a couple of year and be ready to move on to a more substantial and dependable vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	4	heavier than I expect and feel a little blockish to move around at first , but very nicely lowers\/rolls down step . love the attachment - especially the power paw with the brush inside . Works very well for the stair . great suction . take a little bit to get use to the setting . price be great . reliable manufacturer .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I be so po would I waste $ 57 on this . I buy this to dust around the comp. , phone , printer , etc. on the desk and because it get a 4 star rating on 85 hit . let that be a lesson . I agree with the bad review . short run time , long charge time , plus ergonomically awkward to use . I put a shoulder strap on it -lrb- need a hand free to move stuff -rrb- and a better brush head but the short run time -lrb- 5 min ? -rrb- and long charge time -lrb- every time , not just the first time -rrb- still make it a bust . build quality seem good so maybe it 'll work for someone with different need than I . in they defense , I have a B&D; Dustbuster floor vac that I love and run 4 time longer even with the powerhead go .
Vacuum	POS	5	great product , and work really well both on carpet and wood\/concrete . also work very effectively on animal hair -lrb- cat & dog -rrb- . even use it to vacuum off the couch and bedding -lrb- both victim of say animal -rrb- .
Vacuum	NEU	3	Have have two of these in the last 5 year . Consumer Reports recommend and work well out of the box . however , the beater bar motor be too weak to continue work over time . Have have both get progessively weaker and finally just stop work . I do not have pet , just short carpet . attachment do not stay on and quite heavy . hepa filter be good though . tired of buy disposable vacuum . will try a Miele with 7 year motor warranty and go back to canister vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have own this same unit for more than 7 year with 2 household use it weekly and the motor go out just in Feb. 2011 . lucky for I I be able to find the same model on Amazom.com so I jump on it asap . head up this be not the most quite of unit . Lady Lee
Vacuum	NEU	3	good suction on either carpet or bare floor but it be very loud . also , it be impractical to fold\/unfold to connect to the power base .
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy this vac last week . I charge it up a couple of time and use it to pick up cat litter , cat hair off a rug\/furniture , people hair , etc. . it work great . it make vacuum fun . I like how the caddy be attach to the vacuum and carry the tool with it .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I love this vacuum when I get it and even talk my daughter into one . great suction . but after about 4 month the battery start to give out . contact the company and they say I could not purchase a battery as I should not open vacuum . they send I a brand new vacuum cleaner instead which I think be very nice . same thing be happen again . I can barely make it across the kitchen floor without it die . I guess it be time to give on up this one .
Vacuum	POS	5	WE get this sweeper at Kmart for $ 79.99 last year . it be a extra one we use downstairs in laundry room and basement . it be a very good sweeper for the money . in fact I like the extension hose much better then we Dyson animal which be very hard to use with the beater attachment . we lend it to we son and daughter in law to use while they be pack up and move . they be very impressed with the suction it have . we tell they to keep it and I be order another one today from Amazon . Free shipping and a 10.00 rebate . who can beat that ? do wish it have a longer cord and the beater brush turn off while you be use the beater extension on stair -lrb- it will burn you carpet if set on the low setting so watch that -rrb- but i still think it be a great sweeper for the money .
Vacuum	POS	5	we spend a long time research vacuum before decide on the relatively unknown Carpet pro . despite the lack of consumer review , we choose it over several Hoover model in we price range because we question they durability -lrb- we be so tired of buy a vacuum and have it die month in to own it ! -rrb- . all we want be a basic vacuum , nothing fancy , that would hopefully last for many year . I think we have find it in we Carpet pro . it have amazingly strong suction , be actually pretty quiet , and we be almost five month in and have not fill up the first bag yet ! I be puzzle by the negative review on its performance off carpet - why would you buy this type of cleaner to use on wood\/tile ? maybe I be old fashion , but I sweep my tile floor and just vacuum the rug ! anyway , it be a terrific vacuum , a rarity in this price point . con ? well , it be big and yellow , but it be a vacuum , not a piece of art , so who care ? also , the suction be so strong , I can not really use it on my smaller throw rug , so I have to shake they outside or onto a larger carpet .
Vacuum	POS	4	I think when I buy this , it would clean cheaply and would not work well ... I be wrong , it be pretty good . not lie at all , I like it ! I can tell you it be no be near be as good as a roomba , but it be not that bad . it clean BEST on hardwood floor -lrb- because it only have suction , not brush or anything like that -rrb- . so if you have a all carpet floor house do not get this product . but if you have hard wood floor this be a good product for the price . why ? because it have a thing on the bottom that you can but a rag cleaning sheet so it would be like sweeping too . it go for about 50 min and need to charge for about ... 12 hour ... yeah I know , that be LONGGG time , but if you do it overnight , -lrb- 9 hour -rrb- it clean for a long time . so now when you turn it on , it start right away . you have to watch it because sometimes it do get stick on uneven flooring , a mat , or rug . I like this product alot because it be so quiet ! I mean for a vacuum it be super quiet . overall I like it and plan on keep it ! : - -rrb-
Vacuum	POS	4	- very good item for the price ! Works great for a hand hold item ! also great that you do not have to worry about the battery die cuz it run off you cigarette lighter ! great product !!!
Vacuum	NEU	3	I notice the other two review before I mention serious problem with they 4870sz so I think it worthwhile to add my experience . the first one that arrive just do not work . do not pick up dirt . call Eureka customer service and they could not figure out the problem so they tell I to bring it to a authorized service center . that seem pretty ridiculous to I -lrb- I should not have to drag it around to get repair when I buy it new and allegedly work ! -rrb- and I tell the service agent that . then she tell I I also have the option to return it to Amazon . so I ship the big heavy thing back to Amazon for a exchange . Amazon be great because they pay for the return shipping and within two day I have the replacement vac . well this one seem to work pretty well . the only weird thing be that when I first turn it on it seem to move forward on its on like a self propel lawnmower -lrb- which be nice ! -rrb- but within a few minute it become much harder to push . I have not have a chance to call customer service again and ask they if it be suppose to be like that or not . speak of Eureka customer service the woman who I have on the phone seem to know less about the vac than I do after read the direction only once ! that be disconcert . anyway my bottom line be it seem to work fine now for I but you might want to do some more research first . and thanks to Amazon for make the exchange so easy and painless !
Vacuum	POS	5	I have Fibromyalgia and have be look for a light weight cordless vacuum . this hold the charge long enough to do my whole house . I have 3 dog and it handle the dog hair , too ! someone write that it be difficult to empty , but I have no problem do that at all . I now have 4 other cordless vacuum wait to go in my yard sale ! this one be great !
Vacuum	POS	5	I love this little Flex Vac . it be so easy to carry and operate . I really like the easy empty side door and not have to purchase new filter . it easily come apart for cleaning . I have a huge lady bug issue in my home and this little vac be awesome for suck those little critter up . for you folk that have issue with kill they they be still alive when I empty it out outside . I do not have the chargeing issue other folk be c\/o . I can vaccum a whole flight of stair with it .
Vacuum	POS	5	leave it to german engineering ! they sure get this one right . I be really hesitant to spend this much on a vacuum but if this Miele s7210 last at least several year I will be satisfy . it be very quiet compare to the Hoovers and Electrolux that I have use and purchase in the past . I like the swivel\/rotating head design , be not originally sure about that . the layout of the accessory and design of the hose be very convenient . it have do great on we short pile wool rug , tile and hardwood -lrb- with brush head off -rrb- and the small rug in we kitchen . I run over the cord once and it shut itself off to avoid damaging anything when the brush head get jam ! now if I can only teach it to pick-up the kid toy , floor cleaning would be cake ! I will try to update this review next year to make sure it be still hold up well .
Vacuum	POS	5	my carpet be old but have finally get to the point where it be stain so badly , no matter how many time I clean it , the stain keep come back , not matter what I try , and I try everything ! as a final last desperate act , I look for a vacuum on Amazon , and after read all the rave review on this one , I buy it -- and it work ! after vacuum my carpet with this vacuum , I be finally able to get they clean with my steam cleaner . I guess my old vacuum be so feeble that it be leave so much dirt in the carpet that the cleaner just could not do it be job efficiently -- I think with all that dirt in there -lrb- I have three huge dog who live in the house , but love play in the dirt and mud -rrb- try to clean it be just make the stain worse . now my carpet be finally clean again and I be have to steam clean they only rarely , because this vacuum get pretty much everything up to the point where I do not have to clean it so often ! I be on the point of rip my carpet out and buy new carpet , so this vacuum be well worth the price -- it give my carpet a few more year lease on life !
Vacuum	POS	4	purchase to do minor cleanup on my model train layout . previously have a battery operate similiar product about same size . this do the same job without the battery expense . I try the keyboard cleaning and yes it do make that chore a lot easier . with the brush attachment it dislodge the dirt between the key to be suck up by the vacuum . then try the dust that accumulate around the monitor screen edge and corner which also woke well . good for crumb and other food item spill on yout desk also . a good value for minor cleanup .
Vacuum	NEG	1	pro : - good suction - the hepa filter be nice although I do not know how to gauge the effectiveness of it - Easy to switch between floor and hose suction - can turn off the brush when do bare floor con : - heavy - attachment fall off while vacuum - not easy to assemble the attachment - the handle release foot switch mechanism be a bent piece of metal house in fragile plastic which break after a few month . unfortunately that plastic housing be all part of the base of the vacuum so you have to replace the whole bottom of the vacuum . - since I forget to call Eureka within the first year of purchase I be tell I would have to pay for the replacement part even though I tell they it break within the first three month . I ask to speak to a manager and be tell none be available and one would could call I back which never happen . I think the part be around $ 30 with shipping which be a substantial amount compare to the cost of the vacuum . I could not bring myself to pay for the part so we live with a vacuum that fall over which make I angry every time I have to vacuum ! so since Eureka make a fatally flaw vacuum and will not support it or create a replacement part that fix the flaw I will never buy a product from they again .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be expect it to be kind of worthless . but at worst I know the swiffer pad would sweep like the Mint but a lot cheaper because this one do not have that fancy navigation . on we hard wood floor it suck up dust , sand -lrb- volleyball court : -rrb- -rrb- , and cat hair efficiently -lrb- but skip the cat toy and ribbon -rrb- . in we 1250 sq. foot apartment it travel everywhere , get the little bit of cat litter outside the litterbox , and the dust bunny from under the chair and couch . definitely worth $ 44 . do not compare it to a $ 600 Roomba . I be a computer engineer , and I can not wait to add all of the high price feature to this one on the cheap ! if all go well I 'll write a blog and how-to about it ! I plan on replace the mcu\/software with open source code , give it a charge base station and scheduler , extend the run time , speed up charge time .
Vacuum	POS	4	I really like this vacuum . it be easy to assemble , very light , and pick up every inch of dog hair . my other vacuum stop work properly and the first time I use this , it fill both bin with dirt . we be allergy sufferer so I wash the filter after each use ... which be a pain . I do not realize I have to do this before I purchase it or I would have re-considered but I really do like it . I sweep off my furniture and it pick up dirt on the carpet really well too .
Vacuum	POS	5	girlfriend and I decide to replace a old hoover bag vacuum with this one . we go through all of we option include the dyson and other more expensive model . after read all of the positive review on this vacuum we decide why not give it a try and save some cash . glad we do because this vacuum suck ! ok it actually be completely rock , and we be 100 % happy with we vacuum and amazon fast delivery and no sale tax .
Vacuum	POS	5	powerful cleaning action . strong vacuum suction , rotate brush be very effective . couple with hepa -lrb- type a -rrb- bag from Riccar , the unit really help to capture dust . carpet be visibly cleaner . Brush action help to pull the unit forward on carpet . unit do a good job pick up against baseboard . pick up everything in its way . no frill that be really unneeded for my application -- cleaning carpet . 40 ' cord be helpful in long hallway and big room . compare very well against unit that cost over twice as much . I use this one in a commercial application , and will probably buy the permutation with the headlight and 30 ' cord for home .
Vacuum	POS	5	great vacuum , this be the second one i have buy and for the money there be nun better . just keep the filter clean . my first one be five year old and still work fine , use it for the rent house now . my new one work great and i be very happy with it .
Vacuum	POS	4	to keep my floor food free -lrb- no crumb for the mouse -rrb- I use this stick vac -lrb- psv1800 -rrb- . its great for small job do between my weekly vacuuming . where do I use it ? on carpeting , hard floor and furniture . at first it be great on all surface , but after a few month its do better on carpeting than hard floor . I try to vacuum my small car with it , but its length make that awkward . although it fold , the fold be in the wrong direction to make it short enough to use in the car . << Edit Nov 2009 I take it apart recently when it stop pick up altogether . I find that the filter be completely clog . after I clean off the dust -lrb- the filter be re-usable -rrb- it work a good as new ! so I recommend clean the filter every couple of month . >> i use it mostly in the kitchen , dining room and living room . I also use it in my entry way too to prevent dirt from be track all over the house . how 's the battery life ? supposedly it will last 20 minute . but I have not run it for more than 5 minute at a stretch , so the battery have not die on I yet . be it easy to use ? yes , just unfold it and hit the on switch . however , it do require a little strength . it weigh only 5 pound , but concentrate along a stick that could feel heavy . its a little lighter than a gallon of milk -lrb- 8 pound -rrb- . empty the dust , crumb and dirt be a cinch . its bagless , so you open a compartment and everything will fall out . I have not have to reach in and scrape out dust yet . con the price keep this vacuum from earn 5 star . I do not think its worth $ 100 .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I have have this vacuum for 9 month now . the roller brush stop so I put a new belt on that come with the vacuum . it work for one day before it break again . vacuum repair guy say it need a new roller brush and be go to cost I $ 75 to repair . that be half of what it cost in the first place . four year ago , I buy a 12 amp Dirt Devil very basic vacuum for $ 30 -lrb- because I have mostly tile -rrb- . it be still run great , just think I need a more powerful vacuum ... I think wrong . bigger be not always better ... oh yeah , my mom also have a Eureka vacuum a little older than mine - totally different model and guess what ? same thing happen to she vacuum cleaner ! so now I be face with do I fix or do I buy another ? if I do decide to buy another , it will not be a Eureka .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be a great vacuum as far as suction go . more power than anything we have ever own . it have a couple of drawback , but I suppose they be worth it ... it be very heavy ... the cord do not retract automatically -lrb- wish they would add this feature ! -rrb- ... and it be loud . that say , it work very well . I can not believe how much stuff it suck out of we carpet . we have two cat and a dog ... work great on pet hair too .
Vacuum	POS	5	my husband and I buy this handy little vacuum about six month ago and we use it almost daily . great suction , easy to empty , and the tool be extremely handy . this be the first small cordless vacuum I have ever own that have hold up to the small household chore I use it for with perfect dependability . great value for the price . would buy it again and again .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I can not wait to return this to the store . after charge it the allotted time , I try to use it , and when it fail to lift crumb , figure I have not charge it enough . so I re-charge . the power -lrb- or lack of power -rrb- in this hand vac be a total joke . it do not vaccum up a thing . what a total waste of money , this product should not be allow on the market . do not wate you money , you will just be return it .
Vacuum	POS	5	it be a great vacuum that have great filter to trap dirt and relatively quiet for its strong motor . it be a bit on the heavy side , but it be normal for a strong vacuum . overall I be really satisfy with the choice .
Vacuum	POS	5	this work exactly as I hope it would . my cat manage to spread litter all over the place despite my best effort to keep it contain . this vacuum quickly and easily pick it up , be easy to handle and to empty . it be a real life and time saver for I .
Vacuum	NEG	2	First off , do not buy this vacuum if you think you will use the hose\/attachments to clean drapes\/furniture . for some unfathomable reason detach the hose open up a unfiltered exhaust ; whatever you vacuum with the attachment blow right out the back , cover the vacuum , the vacuumer , and the room you just vacuum in dust . it be literally worse than do nothing . the build quality seem pretty cheap ; a plastic clip snap off when I attach the handle , and this be with I follow the direction and not force anything . for floor vacuuming , I can not seem to find a setting for most of my rug that allow the vacuum to glide while still pick up dirt . the three filter system be also ridiculous . why this vacuum get such rave review be totally beyond I . I be between this vacuum and the Eureka Airspeed and settle on the Bissell since target be closer to I than Walmart . if I be you I would try the Airspeed .
Vacuum	POS	5	this be by far the best vacuum cleaner I have ever own !! it be very powerful , you can see dirt be pull out of the carpet & float right in front of it . it only truly do edge vacuum on the right side , but that have not be a problem for I . my last vacuum say it do the edge on both side , but actually do neither . the Carpet pro say it do one edge vacuuming & it work wonderfully ! I upgrade the filter with a Fuller Brush Heavy Duty hepa filter . I also use cloth-like heavy duty allergen bag . my old vacuum make my allergy go crazy the rest of the day , now , no problem after vacuum ! so much better than a bagless ! some thing to keep in mind : the brush do not turn off , which may be a problem for wood floor make sure to order a Carpet pro with the `` t '' at the end to get the onboard tool from what I understand the lower end Carpet pro do not have as many metal part -lrb- you may want to double check this -rrb- so I would go with this one . if you care about a headlight & bag-indicator , check out the higher end Fuller Brush vacuum that be make by the same company -lrb- who also make riccar -rrb- . look for the Fuller Brush vacuum with the metal plate , etc. . that be about all I can think of , I be totally happy with my purchase -lrb- I have have it for about 8mo . now -rrb- , and I highly recommend this vacuum !
Vacuum	NEG	2	about a week after I buy this product the belt break . my neighbor have buy it recently too and they put it out on the curb for the trash collector as they 's break too . my partner fix the belt , but it do not really work that well , especially with the attachment . would not buy it again !
Vacuum	POS	5	I buy this a couple month ago and it work perfectly . before this we have a cheap bag less vacuum from Walmart . I hate it . this bagged vacuum be much better . seem to pick up everything I vacuum over . and I love the bare floor option . I do not think I would use it but we have a cat little box on tile and this vacuum work like a charm . I do not have to get the broom and dustpan out each time now . I just run the vacuum over it and it pick it all up ! it seem to be a little heavier but I do not mind that at all , if anything it just feel solid . I love it and I would recommend it to anyone look for a new vacuum cleaner .
Vacuum	POS	4	i compare this product with the major retailer , the product be cheeper by 20 buck and work very well . I be happy with the product . unfortunately i dont use it any more ; move in a tile location . .
Vacuum	NEG	1	total junk , plastic mechanism to engage and disengage roller break from day one , my mistake be not pack it up and send it back . order it from Amazon be no problem .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I have have this vacuum for two day . before this one , I have another almost identical Bissell which , in my opinion , be not old enough to have give out on I . I have take care of the filter , and empty the dust bin every time . I give Bissell another try because I be familiar with it and I think if the model be not good they would not continue make it the same exact way . I vacuum once every day with the previous vacuum and it pick up everything visible and leave nice vacuum mark , and to I that mean clean . I do not know how wrong I be until I buy this one . I give this model 's initial suction power 5 star . I be absolutely horrify at what come out of my carpet . shock . I go five swipe over the carpet and the bin be full , mostly of ultra-fine dust . I have to empty it 7 + time in my average-sized home at the initial cleaning . I vacuum the whole house again and I notice it be lose suction . I inspect and notice that it be clog , and when I try to use the hose attachment , it be full of dust and come out all over the floor when I pull it out . same two problem with my previous Bissell . I have to take this one back to the store because it just be not good enough to hold up to normal use . I would have give the model 4 star , take responsibility for my own carpet be so filthy but then realize that the reason my carpet be as filthy as they be be because of the poor performance of my previous Bissell . the carpet be new when we buy this house , so Bissell 's performance be overall unacceptable . that be why this Bissell only get 3 star from I , and why I will not buy a Bissell again . when I see how much dirt and dust come out at the initial cleaning , I say to myself , `` no wonder we be always congest , sneeze , and sick . '' not cold -- but allergy ! I do not want to invest much money in a vacuum -lrb- perhaps therein lie the problem ? -rrb- , but it look like something exceptional be necessary .
Vacuum	POS	5	I recently purchase this vacuum to take with I on vacation . I be look for a small vacuum with a hose that be either cordless or rechargeable and affordable . it be even smaller than I expect , which make pack it very easy . it also work well with the space-bag we use for we clothes and bedding . I be very pleased and would certainly recommend this vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	we have 2 cat , one of whom constantly shed 1-inch guard hair . I estimate -lrb- from brushing he -rrb- that the amount he shed per day be about as much as you can hold in you cupped hand . I find that after each run , the Roomba MUST be clean , and this take a really long time since the cat fur get stick and wrap around the brush 's gear shaft to the point where you need scissors to get they off . the fur also get stick on the brush , cause the Roomba to stop pick up any more fur after a short while . all in all , it be faster and MUCH less messy to just vacuum , than it be to clean the Roomba of cat fur after a single run . although the Pet series Roomba may work well for dog , I find it do NOT work well for cat . I regret have get this device .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this vacuum be a good deal if you just wanna use it to vacuum floor but if you use the suction hose alot -lrb- as I do -rrb- it stink . the vacuum be so light that it tip over constantly with just a slight tug on the hose . so you have to keep one hand on the hose and one on the vac to hold it upright . Wish I have my old Eureka yet !
Vacuum	POS	5	I receive my new Miele Callisto today . I must say it work better than any vaccuum I have ever have . my only problem be that after spend $ 900 on a vaccuum , I would think I could get a operating instruction booklet specific to my vaccuum . not true . I be send a generic booklet for the 5000 series . most of the picture and instruction do not match . in fact , if I have not already have a canister vaccuum of a different brand , I would not be able to figure out how to put this vaccuum together or use it . but , I give it 5 star because it be a really great vaccuum .
Vacuum	POS	4	we have struggle over the year to find the right vacuum for we need , which be to clean up enormous amount of pet hair from three huge , shed dog from we wood floor . if we go more than a day or two without vacuum we end up with giant pet-hair-bunny roll around everywhere . however , virtually all of the vacuum we try fall short for one reason or another . then we decide to take a chance on this vacuum , and while it be not perfect it have be , by far , the closest fit for we need . pro and con as follow : pro : it have a long cord . we can do we entire house from one central plug with no extension cord . we house be smallish , so this may not apply to larger house , but the cord be very long by vacuum standard , which be convenient . it be lightweight and maneuverable . we typically use the shoulder strap across we chest to the opposite shoulder which hold the vacuum in place securely , and leave both hand free for vacuuming\/picking up\/moving furniture\/etc . it can reach into small space . a lot of we furniture sit on leg that be about 3-4 inch high , leave a area underneath that can gather mountain of pet hair . use the smaller attachment , the long extension , and the long hose , we can easily vacuum under we couch , table , and other furniture without move they . it be powerful . this vacuum gobble up all the dirt , dust , and pet hair in we house without any issue . good assortment of attachment . con : the bag be messy to empty . it be a reusable bag , although you can also buy disposable bag if you choose . the shoulder strap can be uncomfortable . as I say above , we wear the strap across we chest to the opposite shoulder , and the strap pull against the side of the neck , and can chafe . we end up buy the  Domke U.S. Post Office shoulder pad  there be no place to store\/organize attachment when not in use . so if you be use one attachment and want to switch , you have to go back to wherever you have the attachment store and get the new one . we solve the storage by use coathook on the inside of a closet door , include one to hang the vacuum from , but it would be nice if the attachment be either attach to the unit at all time , or at least in a carry bag or something you could cart around with you easily . none of the attachment be power , mean no beater bar or spin brush . for we this be not a big issue since we house be mostly hardwood floor and leather\/vinyl seating , but if you have a lot of carpeting or rug , and\/or want to use it on cloth upholstery , this might not be the vacuum for you .
Vacuum	POS	4	we purchase this vacuum a few month ago to replace a canister style Kenmore which serve we well for 8 year . I love the small size and lightweight nature of this machine . it have a strong suction and be quite powerful for its size . my 9 yr old buzz the kitchen - bit of food , dog hair , dirt - easily and efficiently with the wand in one hand and the shoulder strap over she shoulder . make the strap convertible to a backpack option -lrb- I do not like to walk with the strap across the other shoulder -rrb- and I would give it 5 star . it do well on both carpet and hardwood - we have tile , wood , and some area rug with not very deep pile .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I get this product for Christmas so I can not return it . I can not believe how many good review this prodict get . first , the beater bar stop work . I take it apart and find that a wire have come loose . I fix that . then by the third time I use this piece of junk the battery run down after 30 seconds of use . it continue to run down after 30 seconds or less of use , with a full charge . it be heavy . the suction be horrible . it will not pick up cat litter off of we hard wood floor . please do not buy this product . even when it work it do not do a good or decent job . I tell my husband the next time he go to the dump to take this with he .
Vacuum	POS	5	a terrific little appliance ! have a lot of power for its small size and be easy to use and empty !
Vacuum	POS	4	this item be purchase for a gift . it be not know at this time whether or not the product be good . the order and ship process be great .
Vacuum	NEG	1	purchase this vacuum after read many positive review . I have a Panasonic which work great for over ten year . this vacuum last two month -lrb- use it twice weekly on three low area carpet -rrb- and the motor would shut off after vacuum for ten minute . suffer another 9 month with this vacuum by shut it off and let it cool down every few minute . then the plastic hose break and I give up . I just purchase a Oreck .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I should have know the first time I use this vacuum that it be a piece of garbage , but I hold onto it because I hear so many good thing about Oreck . the first time I vacuum , the smell of burn rubber -lrb- the belt -rrb- be so bad and it barely pick anything up . so as I be advise , I replace the belt -lrb- after one use for a few minute , the original belt be already melting -rrb- . I live in a small apartment with hardwood floor , no pet and one wool carpet - there be no reason for the vacuum to malfunction like this . the vacuum continue to have the same problem , but when I readjust the belt before every use , it become somewhat tolerable , except for the many time I have to clean out the different compartment because of buildup -lrb- again , not sure how there could be so many issue with such a small , tidy apartment -rrb- . after some research , I learn that Oreck tell its customer to vacuum more `` gently , '' otherwise the belt be prone to burn or come apart . I tend to slowly glide and do not manhandle my vacuum , but I decide to vacuum very slowly and gently to see if it would fix the problem I be have . the problem have not subside , and have become even worse . I can not vacuum my one , small carpet without the smell of burn rubber , a complete lack of suction after about 2 minute , and have to readjust the belt or replace it every single time I want to use it . I be throw this thing away . save yourself the annoyance and the money . I have a small upright dirt devil that cost about $ 35 that work better than this thing . also , I never think I would miss have tool so much - you can not get anywhere near the baseboard and all the dirt that build up along you wall with this thing . and even if my vacuum have a manufacturer 's defect , why have not Oreck replace it ?
Vacuum	NEU	3	I have have the Portapower for over two year and feel that I have now have adequate experience to reflect on its good and bad point . I have also have a Miele canister and can compare it to another albeit far more expensive vacuum . in short , I think you get what you pay for . here be the major problem of the Portapower . 1 . the portapower do not come deliver with the ability to dispose of the bag . really , you have to purchase a additional piece of plastic that convert the round mouth to a square mouth in order to then use disposable bag . the vacuum come with a single fabric bag that be not easy to empty or clean . it be best do outside and with a perfect knowledge of where the wind will blow the bag contents . 2 . the Portapower have virtually no filter for retainer fine dust . absolutely no ability for a hepa or similar filter , unlike the Miele . when you turn on the Portapower you should expect that the room will start have a stale smell , which be from the expulsion of fine dust out the back of the vacuum . the Miele do not have that problem . 3 . the portapower do not have a retractable power cord . the Miele have one that you can activate with you foot . this difference might seem trivial but become a hassle . it come with a band that be intend to tie the fold cord -lrb- about 30 foot -rrb- , but it be so flimsy that it amaze I that any thought be give to its adequacy . even a velcro strap would have be a better solution . 4 . the power of the Powerpack be not go to blow you sock off . instead , I think you will find that it be barely adequate . 5 . by no means be this vacuum design to commercial specification . aside from the tube , there be no metal part . the latch to open the canister to access the aforementioned dust bag be incredibly flimsy . the accessory fitting be noticeably cheap plastic that be not design with a goal of minimize clog . for the Miele the plastic seem much more substantial and the tube diameter be noticeably larger , clearly design to make sure that clog be minimize . moreover , the Miele canister have a compartment for the accessory , while the Portapower have no such feature . on the good side be that the Powerpack have not fail in two year of light use . if I be in a position of purchase a vacuum today , I would spring for the extra cash and purchase a bare bone Miele for $ 300 . I know that it be unfair to compare the portapower to a vacuum that be more than twice as expensive , but I do it only to let the prospective purchaser know that s\/he have not yet reach the price point of marginal diminish return .
Vacuum	NEG	1	my husband buy this vacuum to replace we eureka bagless vac . it be great after the first use but after a couple time of use it start have the same problem as we past vac . it start to spit out debris behind and also when when you use the attachment , it also blow out dust . such a pain to clean the filter . now I be really think of go back to the old school bag vac . do anybody know a vacuum worth the money anymore ?!
Vacuum	NEG	2	we be on we 2nd one of these . the first vacuum have the foot pedal come off frequently and and issue w \/ the height adjustment . we take it back to the retailer within 90 day for a replacement , per instruction from the Eureka support hotline . the 2nd vacuum be better , but have issue . 1 -rrb- hose be too long on bottom by design , so it fall out of the cradle when not be use , so you have to pull excess slack back and make a loop at bottom . 2 -rrb- it go through belt quickly , if you suck up a sock or other , you have milli seconds to turn the power off , before the belt burn and break . 3 -rrb- if you bump the front plastic bumper , then it will start rub and make noise , then you have to pull the plastic back out . 4 -rrb- hose broke\/coming apart at connection to straight attachment , after 2 year .5 -rrb- belt clutch slip , when upright , you shut off the brush for hard floor cleaning . you find it spin when you do not expect and possibly scratch the surface or wear carpet in place . a major independent consumer magazine give this high mark , and usually I agree with they on product , but not this time . prior to this vacuum , my last Eureka Boss last 15 year , and work well , infrequently need belt . I do not think we will make 4 year w \/ this vacuum before throw it away .
Vacuum	POS	5	UPDATE : after two month of use ... I give it five star again . people , this be for small clean up job not vacuum whole home !! here be a tip . after you have cycle through five charges\/discharges keep it plug in full time . so you use it for say two minute , plug it back in . keep it plug in and it will always be ready . original review : if you plan on use this as you only vacuum you will be disappoint . for smaller job this thing rock ! the pet hair tool really work ... be a bit skeptical it could lift up month of thick cat hair but no problem . battery life be 10 + minute and I have only cycle the battery a few time . 10 minute be actually a fairly long time for most job . it be light , the tool do they job , it be powerful ... five star from I !
Vacuum	NEG	2	I be very disappoint with this vacuum . I just get the 18V Pivot Vac  Black & Decker Pivot Vac 18V Cordless Pivoting Hand Vac , phv1810  I can clean my floor mat in about 1\/2 the time with the other vacuum because the suction power be much better . do yourself a favor and get that one as it be only a few dollar more , it be cordless and rechargeable and suck much more than this product . the Guy Fieri inspire color scheme be off-putting as well .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I think my title say it all . this be not in the same class as a simplicity , Dyson , or Oreck . but then , it be about 1\/3 of the price of one of those similarly configure vacuum . when one evaluate this model , one have to compare it to Hoovers , Bissells , Dirt Devils , etc. . base on my experience with those brand , this vacuum rank ahead of the class . frankly , it suck . but it suck very well . better than the Hoover Supremes I have have . as for the weight , well yes , it be heavy but not any moreso than the Hoovers or Bissells I have own . and besides , the weight be list in any advertisement or be apparent at time of physical purchase . I be 6 ' 200 pound and in decent shape . the weight be not a issue for I . but for someone half my size , I can see where it would be a pain . if that be the case , you 'll need to look at more expensive model -lrb- that be lighter -rrb- to get the sort of power that this have . in any case , the attachment work as well as any , the cord be just as obtrusive as the other , and the plastic design look just as attractive and feel just as cheap as hoover . it be more powerful than other in it be class . aside from that , everything be pretty much the same . my only fear be that the belt will break easily , as it be terribly thin and appear very flimsy . but I do not know that for a fact . I 'll amend this review if that be the case . if you budget for a vacuum be $ 300-500 , then by all means buy a simplicity . if you budget be $ 150-300 , buy a refurbish simplicity from a reputable dealer . but if you , like I , be satisfy with a ` Chevy ' and have no problem replace it after 5-10 year or so , this might be the best deal for you . by the way , I pay $ 118 with free shipping for this . I might have pay $ 10 more but that would have be my limit with this class of vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	5	for starter , consider that high-quality consumer vac be run $ 200 - $ 300 , and substantially more if you go with a Dyson or something . we seriously consider a Dyson canister , and I be very , very happy that we skip it . it not only would have be a waste of money , it would have be less convenient . we have a triplex -lrb- 3-story -rrb- apartment in New York . all hardwood floor , and lot of stair . this thing be absolutely , totally perfect for it . the suction be huge , even after week of use in a apartment full of dog hair . it be design so effectively that all the hair get suck deep into the bag , and do not block the airflow . the bag be a long-lasting cloth bag that be very easy to remove and empty , and there be no additional cost for consumable . however , if you would prefer a paper bag that you do not need to empty , you can use those instead . either way , it work great . it also work great on we area rug , because the suction be very good . it be very lightweight , and come with both carry-handle and shoulder-strap . so you can range all over the apartment , over and around thing , up and down the stair , carry it comfortably all the way . my wife be a little smaller than I , and also find it very light and great to use . the long , super-strong metal tube , with rotate head , work its way really conveniently underneath and around the table , chair , and other furniture . it come with great attachment for baseboard and other need . the metal tube have a secure lock mechanism , so it be both easier to disassemble than a plastic one that often get stuck , and easy to reassemble and snap together . it be go to last forever . the flexible hose be make of really strong material , with a rigid , springy coil inside . it do not crimp , fold , bunch or otherwise cause problem . it also shrink nicely when you be not put any tension on it . which make it very convenient to store : it be super-compact to start with , and you can quickly pop the hose & tube off the main body of it , so you can store they wherever they fit best . incidentally , Hoover also include a very rugged strap to snap the cord in place when you be not use it . the power cord , by the way , be just incredibly long , so I can do a whole floor of the apartment , and get 2\/3 of the way down the stair , before I need to unplug and move the connection . it be the longest I have ever have , even on a full-size upright . we have have it for a month now , and use it often , and I have yet to find a single flaw with it . I suppose they could round the edge a bit more , so that when I be dance around the apartment with it sling over my shoulder , I do not even notice they . but that be about it . some reviewer suggest they integrate the attachment storage into the body of the vac . but that would dramatically increase weight and size , so it would be stupid . they could give you a little holder for they , but then they would have to charge you more , and you probably have a bag or drawer or whatever for they already . if you want , you can buy the $ 20 `` portapack '' carry bag , which include a spiffier shoulder strap , and a little mesh bag for the attachment . but if you do not need it , they have save you the $ 20 . unless you have deep-pile carpet , or a dog\/cat that constantly shed fine hair -lrb- and so you need a vac with a power head -rrb- , this be a really phenomenal performer , and a amazing value , which be much more maneuverable than a upright could over be .
Vacuum	NEU	3	First off , I 'll try to be as objective as I can with the admit limited experience with vacuum cleaner -lrb- probably around the same as anyone who do not work in the vacuum or cleaning industry -rrb- . this be my first bagless cleaner , I have use a Eureka and a Hoover for a combined 12-13 year before switch to this . the vacuum cleaner have great suction , but I have learn several thing that potential buyer should probably be aware of : 1 -rrb- probably the most minor gripe be a lack of a `` brush switch '' that switch off the main brush when you be use the hose , which I have on my previous -lrb- admittedly more expensive -rrb- Hoover . the vacuum be design so that the front pop up when its in the upright position , but I find that the brush still rub against my not-very-high carpet . 2 -rrb- the hose be nowhere near long enough if you want to vacuum stair , I have to move the vacuum every couple step to keep the thing from tip over . and I do not know why a stiff plastic piece be at the end of the hose , it make vacuum in tight space a hassle -lrb- I get that it be for reach , but would not it be nice to have it as a removable piece so you have the option ? -rrb- 3 -rrb- be prepare to buy a extra filter , the helix design be not the best , as it rely on spin the air to fling out particle of dust , which settle into the cup , the problem be , once a little dust start to clog the little slit and filter up , the suction weaken , which reduce the suction a little bit allow more dirt to get suck into the filter , which reduce the suction a little bit more , and so forth . a cyclone be slightly better because the swirl of air travels upwards , allow more dirt particle to settle what wind up happen be the filter quickly clog up and it lose suction quite quickly . my place be not very big , maybe around 1500 sq ft , and I vacuum once every 2-4 week , and I find I have to wash the filter nearly every time . 4 -rrb- lastly , and most importantly , let you filter dry overnight after you wash it , and run you vacuum for a few minute after install it to make sure its dry . I make the mistake of not run it -lrb- though I do let the filter dry overnight -rrb- and the next time I use it , it smell like rotten fish . I have to take the whole thing apart and clean everything to get rid of the smell . would have be nice if they have a sort of catchment to trap any water that might have drip . other than that , I find the vacuum to be acceptable , though have to wash the filter so often be a hassle and make a royal mess . I be not sure if all bagless vacuum require so much cleaning and emptying , but next time I 'll probably go back to a bagged one , or try a cyclonic vacuum make sure its less of a hassle to clean first .
Vacuum	POS	5	be look for a good quality vaccum for the new car . trust this brand since I have a few of they other product . this really be a great buy and good quality vaccum , pick up just about everything , be relatively quiet and nicely compact . would recommend to everyone .
Vacuum	POS	5	I love this little vacuum ! I work in a nursing home and we have a couple of they and we maintenance and housekeeping staff use they to clean in the little crack in doorway and such . for such a little vacuum , I think the price be a little high , but be a commercial Hoover product and because the one at my work be definitely older model and still work great , I expect to get year of good use out of this little vacuum . the only problem I have encounter thus far be that I can not attach my miniature detail attachment to the hose , but I be go to rig up a adapter with some pvc pipe to fix that . other than that , I be highly satisfied and highly recommend !
Vacuum	POS	5	I have try many car vac . this one be far superior to any of they . the design allow you to reach tiny corner and space . it have plenty of power to most job .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I be a mom with 3 kid and a minivan -lrb- stereotypical , but true -rrb- . I buy this because I need a cordless vac that I could use in the car and my dust buster be not cut it for suction . yes , this have better suction , but it take 20 hour to charge and literally only work for 5 minute . the motor start to slow before 10 swipe and you feel like you be race the clock try to get the cleaning do before it die while the suction be decrease in strength the whole time . Cleaning be annoying enough , I need it to be stressful too ? Ok , so it be only 5 minute of stress , but annoying nonetheless . realistically , with 3 kid and a minivan , 5 minute be not go to get my car clean , and you actually have to charge it another 20 hour before you can use it with any evidence of effective suction . unrealsitic and basically useless . it do have a pet hair tool which may be useful , but we have no pet hair to clean . honestly , if you need to clean pet hair , save you money and use one of those mask tape lint brush from the dollar store !
