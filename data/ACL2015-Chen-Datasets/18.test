Dumbbell	POS	5	I absolutely love these dumbbell . the ease of use be incredible and the ability to change small increment in weight and not have weight all over the place be great . right now I be do some circuit type training that require you to move from one exercise to another with a very short break , these make it easy . I can finish a exercise , change both these from one weight to another and get they in position for the next exercise in under a minute , easily . I have have no problem at all with the quality and use . you do need to make sure the pin be fully seat and both side be under the same weight as many have state but it be no extra effort , just pay attention and make sure the pin come all the way through when you push it in . they be easier to change on a hard surface , if you use a carpeted floor it help to lift one side to change the pin . only negative I can come up with , these do not expand into a heavier set so you may grow out of this set . so think that through carefully as you may save $ $ in the long run by buy the next set up to begin with .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have have a pair of the 1090 dumbbell -lrb- 90 lb each -rrb- for about 10 month and be lift they from the floor until now . the price finally drop here on Amazon so I decide to pull the trigger . Trust I , if you be above 30 like I , and can not recuperate as quickly as a 18 y.o. . . purchase these ... you 'll save you back . these be sturdy , well-made and convenient stand for you selecttech dumbbell . the shipping carton say 45 lb -lrb- the outer-box be marked Bowflex stand ... so if get as a gift , have it gift-wrapped -rrb- . unlike other reviewer , I have absolutely no problem set this up ... the instruction be straightforward ... they be the ` exploding-diagram ' type ... so maybe I be visual like that . I recommend not take all the washer , nut and bolt out of the packaging ... just slice the shrink-wrap to keep the bolt in they position ... that way it be easy to differentiate . it come with a allen-wrench , but you 'll need a 9\/16 socket for the nut-side ... I recommend hand-tightening until it be fully set-up ... just to make sure everything be align . the caster work fine ... move it around a couple of time and no problem ... but they do seem cheap compare to the rest of the stand . if they break , I 'll just use the peg . all in all , it be well worth it to get the stand ... I just have to save up long enough after I get the dumbbell themselves .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I use this dumbbell for bicep curl . very nice and sturdy . on Amazon it be go for $ 30 i think ... here be the bottom line . shipping be almost as much as the product . its pretty much a rip off . I buy the from a store near my house that I work at and I pay $ 25 before any employee discount . now that $ 5 before shipping . good dumbbell but not worth 60 buck
Dumbbell	POS	5	this item be from the same company I buy my plate holder from . I be a lot more pleased with this rack than the plate tree -lrb- not that there be much wrong with the tree , it be just a little on the light side as far as the gauge of steel use . -rrb- this thing be build tough , and be large enough to accommodate plenty of dumbbell . I have a few different brand of dumbbell , and have no problem with they fitting this rack . like the plate tree , assembly for this be really easy . there be more piece for this than the plate tree , so it take a little longer , but it be still basic . Everything go together with large nut and bolt . the rubber foot both protect the surface of the floor , and prevent the rack from move around . this item , combine with the plate tree , really sharpen up the look of my home gym . everything be nice and neat and have its place . bottom line be I be pleased with this item , and would recommend it . oh yes , it be also ship in a timely manner .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	this shakeweight do not work at all . 6 minute a day , no way ! if you be look for a workout , do not waste you money on this !
Dumbbell	POS	5	when I see these weight on the internet , I be really turn off by the `` square '' shape . I try to find they in local store to see if they be really that ugly in person , but could not find any . however , just as I be set to purchase from a different manufacturer which offer a traditional barbell look , one review on the PowerBlock change my mind . it be a review by a woman state that the PowerBlock 's handle grip be very comfortable for a woman 's hand , whereas as the handle on the other set I be consider buy be fatter in the middle , make it harder for smaller hand to get a good grip . anyway , go with the PowerBlocks in spite of the square shape and be totally in love with they now . they fit my hand perfectly and take up less space than the two pair of dumbbell that I have be use previously -lrb- a 3lb . set and a 5 lb . set -rrb- . and it be really , really easy to switch the amount of weight with the pin setup , which be very similar to the way you change weight on a weight machine at the gym . I would definitely recommend these ...
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be just what my husband need ! no more bend over to heft the weight up off of the floor . the stand be easy to put together , unlike some of the review I have read prior to purchase . I 'll have to guess that bowflex hear enough bad review of the instruction to re-write they . that be say , my husband simply look at the diagram and do not read any of the instruction , anyway . he be not a super handy man , so this be say a lot . he love it , I love that he be safer . two thumb up !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	so , I think this shake on it be own -lrb- well , with the help of battery -rrb- but it do not . I read the review and see other people who say the same thing but I think , maybe they just do not figure out how to turn it on . I be wrong . obviously we be not the only people to think it shake on it be own because the people of Shake Weight have they own website explain how to make it shake ... call ` howtoshakeit.com ' so , if you do not believe I -lrb- or think I just do not know how to turn it on -rrb- go to that website . it seem like the weight and the shake part of it probably do help with you muscle and everything but it also seem like , if you hold a regular weight very loosely -lrb- allow it to slide between you hand -rrb- and shake it like you would the shake weight , that probably work about as well . they suggest you do it for 6 minute a day -lrb- which sound easy -rrb- but for beginner , that be nearly impossible , as the weight really do work you muscle . if you buy the weight new , it come with a short video with a 6 minute workout and if you watch it , you see that the lady who do the video do not even seem like she can do the whole 6 minute straight , as the lesson do not seem to be one continuous shot but clip paste together to make a complete 6 minute video -lrb- if that make sense -rrb- . if you have get the money to spend for a ` special ' dumbbell , then go ahead and buy this . but if you be think it be go to be some kind of miracle worker , I do not think it be . I highly recommend you try shake a regular dumbbell first and see if that help you muscle because , like I say , that be basically what this do . I be a little disappointed .
Dumbbell	POS	5	why spend a couple hundred buck for a dumbbell rack that do not do anything but hold you dumbbell ? for less than a hundred buck this item be great . it be quick and easy to set up , I have all the piece that it be suppose to have and it do exactly as it be suppose to -lrb- sit in the corner of my garage and hold weight -rrb- . what more can I ask for ?
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have be use this product twice a day for 2 week and I have to say , it seem to be work well for I so far . yes it do make a noise but personally , do not bother I at all . if you be look to create definition in you arm , I do not this this be the product for you . if you just want to slim you arm down , this should work well . it be difficult to use at first but once you get the hang of it , you will start to feel it work right away . I have already notice a difference in my arm and so have my husband . I be give it 4 star because of the difficulty of first figure out how to work it correctly . other then that I be love it . it be like any work out equipment . the result reflect the effort you put in .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I do this everyday and must tell you at first thought I would give it try . do not like what my arm be look like . after 3 week I see result . I keep the dvd in the player and do it every morning . you think at first it be not really do to much but the last of set on the dvd I feel the burn . love it !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I wish I have pay more attention to everyone else 's review because I be really surprise when I open the box and there be only one dumbbell ! I would not recommend buy this - go buy a pair together instead !
Dumbbell	POS	4	I use this product for a little more than half a year before I decide to stop . I truly do feel the burn from the workout , but there be just too many con and I have no significant result even though I use the product for such a long time with workout that last even longer than the 6 minute they recommend . pro : 1 -rrb- the exercise on the dvd be very easy to follow and it include a timer to indicate when to stop . 2 -rrb- you will most likely get sore after the first several day , indicate that you muscle be in fact be work -lrb- not necessarily get result -rrb- . 3 -rrb- the dumbbell have groove on both end to facilitate you handle for the shoulder exercise -lrb- see # 5 in con for handle for triceps and biceps -rrb- . 4 -rrb- no battery ! I think most people assume the shake function be electrical . 5 -rrb- if you buy this directly from the manufacturer , you get a 100 % money-back guarantee , include the shipping and handle cost to send it back . they refund the purchase price of the weight almost immediately . con : 1 -rrb- the dvd be certainly not a $ 15 value . the dvd contain only 3 exercise limit to 3 upper muscle : triceps , biceps , and shoulder all within 6 minute . 2 -rrb- for 6 minute a day , I find the workout to be too easy . I be average-build and I have to work at least 15 minute before I start to get tired . 3 -rrb- the dumbbell itself be very noisy , especially if you be try to get a more intense workout by shake the weight more vigorously . you can even hear the noise when you be watch the exercise on the dvd . additionally , I would often be interrupted several time to keep the noise down from the weight . 4 -rrb- towards the end of you workout , the dumbbell will start to slip out of you hand because the palm of you hand start to sweat . as a result , I have to stop my workout a couple of time to readjust the weight . 5 -rrb- exercise during the triceps and bicep exercise be very awkward . you have to wrap one hand around the middle of the weight during these exercise , but it be difficult to hold on to the middle while you be shake . therefore , the weight be design more for shoulder exercise . 6 -rrb- I be sorry to say this , but I definitely look ridiculous when use this product . you would not believe how many people have laugh at I . therefore , you can only use this product if you be by yourself . 7 -rrb- in term of the money-back guarantee if purchase it from the manufacturer , you have to personally make the initiative to contact they and have they refund you for the shipping . unlike the refund for the product , they have still yet to refund I for shipping and handling .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this be a great product - quality and value be superb . just a bit `` bulky '' , but better than have 200 dumbbell in you home . the only `` imperfection '' be that you have to be careful not to hit yourself in the face with the corner . I do not hit , but you do have to be mindful when you do maneuver around you head .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I read a few review about build this say it be tough , so I be wonder what I be get myself into . the instruction be a breeze , there be 3 different long screw , and as long as you place they next to each other , you can tell the size difference . it take I about 15 to 30 minute to build this with a 9\/16 '' ratchet wrench and the allen key they supply . Make sure you have that wrench or a adjustable though . its pretty sturdy , I opt not to put the wheel on as I will not be move it at all . it alleviate tension off of you lower back and make it easier to place the 1090 dumbbell in there holder without mis-alligning of damage they . definitely recommend if you buy the 552 's or the 1090 's . I have see it online on Amazon between $ 129.99 and $ 148.99 . I purchase it at $ 139.99 because I could not wait any longer .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	let 's get something clear right away -- the Shake Weight do NOT come close to replace weight-lifting or other more intense resistance exercise . those that do light calisthenics or nothing at all will be please with the Shake Weight . it give a quick `` pump '' to you arm and provide some `` toning '' to the muscle in a very short period of time . the benefit be short-lived and very limited . even do the Shake Weight routine several time a day will not produce much muscle gain . you would be much better off do a weight resistance program that break down muscle tissue and repair it larger and stronger over time . if you be sedentary and want to do a very basic , easy exercise that take little time , the Shake Weight might be right for you . just be aware of its limitation and be realistic about the result you 'll get .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this product look good with a charcoal hammer enamel finish . it assemble easily with no issue . its very sturdy and because the rack be slant front to back , its easy to access the weight . I like the three rack because it fit a full complement of dumbell with some room leave over for extra plate for a bench press . as a example , I have hexagonal dumbell , and my weight set-up be as follow : 5-8-10-15 lb pair on the top rack ; 20-25-30 lb pair on the middle rack ; and 35 lb on the lower rack along with my extra 5lb and 10 lb plate -lrb- which I make a simple holder for -rrb- .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I really like these weight . you do have to press the handle down to change the weight on carpet , but I 'll take that over have multiple set of weight that take up 5x the space any day . I have not have problem with the pins\/magnets that other have mention and I have be use they for several week .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very sturdy rack . hold up my dumbbell set with ease . Grey gloss finish bring out the professional gym look . it be a bonus that it be 3-tier . Higly recommend it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be now week six for I . I can not believe my eye . I use it everyday . I can only do one minute behind my head for my triceps because it burn so much . I have increase from one minute to three minute in front for my biceps . I try this because $ 15 be nothing after ready that many people love it . I think if you be a gym rat , this be not for you , however , many woman have really poor arm strength and this be a wonderful start . my arm be tone and the fat be disappear . I have lose one inch on each arm because I measure it before I start use it . once this become too easy , I plan on buy the man 's Shake Weight .
Dumbbell	POS	4	excite to receive the Shake weight that my husband order . I like it . Easy to use and very portable , I can take it anywhere . I like the fact that I can just pick it up while watch tv and not even notice it .
Dumbbell	POS	4	the PowerBlock dumbbell set be great for someone like I who live in a apartment and have limit space . I get a full range of motion and the pin stay in place very securely so I never worry about have the weight above my head . sometimes the weight get stick when lower they into the unused plate , but if you keep it straight when you lower it there be no problem . I think the carpet allow they to move so I may get the tray or get some kind of hard surface to keep they from tilt . otherwise a great product that perform perfectly ! recommend :  PowerBlock Personal Set Tray
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I just buy one of these to go along with my dumbell and I have to say the instruction be some of the worst I have ever see . nice idea , but trouble out of the box !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	that paint you see on the number ? do not get too attach to it . for a more comfortable grip try wrap the handle in pipe insulation with ducktape . also make sure you have floor mat . these be usually a better deal than the rubber coated one .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the shake weight be the best complement to any one workout equipment ! when use properley it do exactly what the trainer say it do ! 5 star ! WooHoo
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy 2 of they . I do not have any problem . they be cute , and work for I . I like they .
Dumbbell	POS	4	ok , so , I have own this product for about 6 week now , and I have be use it on a regular basis . I `` do '' try to work out a few time per week anyway , but , I do not always have that luxury -lrb- due to hectic work schedule -rrb- . anyway , after use the Shake Weight for maybe 3 week , I have start to notice small improvement in the toning of my arm , bicep strength , and overall arm strength . I have no tie to this product , but , I have to say , I really like use it ! I keep use it because it seriously break the monotony in my old -lrb- and boring -rrb- work-out routine , -lrb- which be very important for build muscle -rrb- . I notice that I be use muscle that I do not normally use , from dumbbell & weight alone ... and I must admit , it be fun to use , and you will feel you arm burning after just a few short minute of use this product -lrb- also , a good thing -rrb- . and , YES , there be some `` science '' behind this product . be it the `` be all end all '' of workout ? no ! you still have to eat right , try to live a healthy lifestyle , etc etc. ... but , it be a well construct product , that be fun to use , and `` so far '' seem to be work like they claim . I be usually pretty skeptical when I see something on a tv commercial regard fitness , but , have be into fitness & martial art -lrb- on & off -rrb- for year , I know the science be base on Isometric Contraction , and resistance . it be a proven science and it do work . I do similar excersize when I train in martial art year ago ... only we do not have this type of product back then . yes , there be plenty of negative comment out there -lrb- regard this item -rrb- , but , do not knock it until you have try it . I really think it be kinda weird at first , but , when you start use it , and notice a difference in a reasonable amount of time , you 'll keep use it , which be also very important . my only complaint with the `` Men 's '' version of the Shake Weight , be that it be only 5 lb . would have be a bit better if it be 7 or maybe 8lb ... but , that be just I . maybe they 'll make another model down the road ??? that be my story , and I be stick to it . : -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	I really enjoy this thing ! grant , this exercise could be do without the shake weight , but it be fun to have a prop to help with the shakin ' . be careful though to get use to the weight , and ease you muscle into it before diving into the dvd routine . ; -rrb-
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I be really look forward to the shake weight ... even though my husband make fun of I for buy it . I guess I be lazy in believe that this be actually power rather than I do the work of shake it . I be not sure yet whether I be go to keep it , mainly because it be a bit cumbersome to hold and my wrist feel sore after shake it .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this be item be awesome will highly recommend purchase the bowflex selecttech 552 dumbbell with the stand . the stand be the key component you do not have to bend to pick up the weight its located at the proper height , make it very convenient to do you rep and ease to change the weight . the downside be that the weight do slip sometime would recommend jingle the dumbbell before remove from cradle to insure the proper weight be lock to the dumbbell and not fall on you foot or toe -lrb- that would hurt pretty bad -rrb- . one other thing the stand be miss label so double check with diagram before tighten nut and bolt of the initial stand .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	we buy a pair of the 8 lb weight . in we workout room , we set the weight on a ledge that be paint . we have two other set of neoprene weight that we buy from target a couple year back and have no problem do this . these weight stick to the paint and pull it right off the ledge . so we put a mat under they . next ... they stick to the wall when they get too close . luckily we have more paint to touch everything up .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I just buy the Shake Weight at Wal-Mart for -lrb- ... -rrb- in they as see on tv section to try it out . so far 9 out of 10 as see on tv item that I have buy have a be a joke . -lrb- Shoes under be the only one I keep and even then I almost do not because it be so flimsy . -rrb- I like to try out the product to see if it work and because it be Wal-Mart I have no problem return it . I do not know how I be go to do that with the Shake Weight because as far as I can see there be no way to test to see if it actually work . how long do it take to make my arm look better ? -lrb- I think this be why there be virtually no review as yet , people can not tell if it be work and they get tire of it before it be obvious that it be or be not work . -rrb- but here 's what I have get so far : `` Feel the burn '' : it be true that you biceps do start to `` burn '' while you be use this product but I think that be from have they unnaturally clench for 6 minute straight while you shake yourself to death . -lrb- yes , this be how the product work , you bicep muscle clench up and stay that way while you be do this exercise . -rrb- I be always teach to do `` rep '' during strength training which allow the muscle to tense and rest every few seconds while you work it use resistance -lrb- i.e weight -rrb- . `` it be a weight '' : no , not really . it have a little bit of weight to it but there do not seem to be any resistance to this tool and it seem that 6 minute of continuously have you tensed muscle shake would just hurt you -lrb- hence the `` burn . '' -rrb- not to mention that even if the product do work there be no way to add more weight to it and you muscle would quickly outgrow it . then it be obsolete . `` shake '' : when do shake fat to shrink it come back in style ? remember those old contraption fat man in sweat shirt would be strap into and it would shake they belly in the hope that it would make they smaller ? there be a reason you do not see those anymore . they do not work and they be dangerous . `` Dynamic Inertia '' : go ahead , Google it . you will not find it anywhere on the web unless it be in connection to the shake weight . when do a product get to coin new physics terminology ? and exactly what do it mean ? `` it look silly and kinda pervert '' : the product do not claim this but almost everyone else do . the product do look like a elegant massage toy and face it , you do look and feel silly shake you arm fat everywhere . -lrb- hey , if you do not have arm fat then you would not be use it . -rrb- and pervert , well , there be even a spoof video on YouTube that be so r-rated that I refuse to discuss it further here . other review on the web : there be like 4 and I think they be all write by the people who make -lrb- or sell -rrb- the product . they have almost nothing negative to say about the Shake weight and one woman even claim it make she boob bigger . yeah right . and finally , the price : -lrb- this be maybe the only good thing about this item . -rrb- it seem as if the manufacturer can not agree on how much this thing should cost . they infomercial list it at a bargain at 19.99 plus shipping and handling -lrb- which I think be like another 7 or 8 buck -rrb- and Wal-Mart have it simply for the -lrb- ... -rrb- . so what be up with they sell it on Amazon for almost double the price ? well , it turn out that the the manufacturer be not the one sell the item . jwwbooks4 be the company sell it through Amazon and I guess they be hope to make a big profit . it be a little shady in my opinion . final Verdict : I guess I be go to see if actually work . hey , I have get 90 day through Wal-Mart , but I be not go to hold my breath for result . if you do decide to try it , go to Wal-Mart and save yourself the shipping and the handle through the infomercial , or the extra 17 dollar they be charge through Amazon . hey , you do have the option to save yourself the headache altogether and do not bother to buy it at all . you can get a decent set of weight for about the same price .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this rack be perfect for the at home gym . it hold a good set of weight and be strong . the way each level be set back make be much easier to get the weight off the bottom rack . I be very pleased with this product .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	this be a joke ! if you do not want to ever really workout or ever build a single muscle than this be for you ! come on people !! please !! if you do not want to workout or get in shape , spend you money on food !!!! not something that simply make you feel like you be do something and make someone else rich !! what be next ... 3 second ab ???!!!
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I order what I think be a set of 2 barbell , after all , who buy only one barbell ? apparently , I do because when the shipment arrive , it contain only one . I be irritated with myself for not check the description more closely , but I be also annoy with Amazon for not make it more clear that the barbell be not a set .
Dumbbell	POS	5	it work ! it do what it say . you need to be patient with it , and just like and piece of gym equipment , you have to learn how to use it . whereas I do not recommend this as a replacement for free weight , or you regular gym workout if that be what you be do , I do recommend it as a addition to they . if you do not have free weight , or do not have time to go to the gym , this will do very well . if you can get a 6 minute work-out out of it right away , why be you use it ? -lrb- LOL ! -rrb- seriously , take you time with it , go as long as you can , be patient with it , use all the different exercise routine that it show you how to use -lrb- the include dvd be pretty good , and the website have even more -rrb- , and work up to as long as you can . you will feel it immediately -lrb- A.K.A. sore at first , burn once you get the hang of it - and burn be a good thing ! -rrb- . the only thing I do have to say as a downside to this be the grip . it be a tad uncomfortable , and it get a little slippery when you start to sweat -lrb- and you will ! -rrb- I highly recommend a good set of workout glove with good rubber grip -lrb- Sears sell they - $ 18 -rrb- . other than that , use it regularly , and start slow , just as you would any other workout regimen , and work up to that 6 minute a day workout . no I do not look like the guy in the commercial - yet - but I notice a significant increase in my arm , shoulder , and abdomen muscle . use the dvd and website !! good stuff for $ 30 !
Dumbbell	POS	5	this funny contraption actually work . my arm get tire after a minute ! I recommend to anyone who want to tone they arm . I use while watch tv .
Dumbbell	POS	5	look at several differant type of rack , this one have prove to be very good quality and easy to put together . would highly reccomend product and amazon . I pay $ 87.00 and no shipping .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy these when I want to start work out again . call on my past excuse -lrb- the gym too far , take too long to get there , in , out , and back , et al -rrb- , I know the most effective way to tackle that be to bring what I could to I . also , I live in a apartment so any and all concept of build a actual gym , couple with the fact that I do not waltz around lighting cigar with $ 100 bill , lead I to find a solution . and that solution ? powerblock ! while obviously not provide a full gym , you can do a lot with free weight and cheap weight bench that you can tuck away somewhere . not only be these effectively cheaper than buy a entire set of weight , they be not incline to punch a hole through the floor , annoying my downstairs neighbor and eliminate any hope for my security deposit . they can also be easily stow away behind the couch , under the desk , or wherever you can fit two 45 lb dumbbell . the one and only complaint I have for they be that they do not have a 2.5 jump -lrb- 22.5 , 32.5 , etc -rrb- but they can do 7.5 . I know I be nit pick here but it be nice when you be push to not have to jump 5 lb . also , you can max they out fairly quick with thing like press make it necessary in no time to throw down for the expander set . other than that , though , they have be the best fitness investment I could make ! if you or anyone you know want to find a easy solution to bring the gym home , I would recommend these over any equipment out there .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love have a full set of freeweight in the size of one pair ! just gotta be careful when you be switch weight because if you have the clip on a diagonal it get dangerous and awkard . overall it be great !!
Dumbbell	NEU	3	First of all , you really need some type of stand to set you SelectTech weight on , and this be probably the one you want since it be make specially for they . the construction be good and solid . it come with solid foot and with caster . you can attach either , depend on whether you plan to leave it in place or need move the stand about . the stationary foot be fine , but the caster that come with mine be very flimsy and too lightweight . they deform under the load when the weight be put onto the stand -lrb- 552 's -rrb- . the wall of the casing hold the wheel flatten some , make it hard to roll the stand . I end up throw these caster away and buy a set of heavy duty caster that be design to take the weight . I can roll the stand easily and smoothly now , but higher quality one should have come with the unit . if you do not think you will be move the stand around , this will not be a issue for you , as the solid foot work well . my other complaint be that I would like to see the stand just a little bit higher , as some other reviewer have mention . I be 5 ' 10 '' and have to stoop just a little when pick the weight up . it be not a big deal because I do not have to bend much at all , but it be something I have to be aware of and careful about because of lower back weakness . another couple of inch in height would have be perfect . but overall , I can recommend the stand .
Dumbbell	POS	5	do what it say it do . I have have my power block for over 3 year and they be as good as new . Great , easy to use , well-made product .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	the product be well-made but nautilus , maker of bowflex product , like many fitness equipment seller , have integrity issue . my stand be obviously a return . the box be poorly retap . when I open the box , the bubble pack with the screw , nut , and washer be open as a person would open a bubble pack by peel off the paper backing . the hardware be scatter all over the box . after sort the hardware and search the box , I be short two washer . there be a small scratch on a leg of the stand . I do not mind a return , but at least , check the stand for nick and miss piece , and retape the box so a return be not so obvious . actually , care about you customer . the building of the stand take I three hour , but there be no problem . the instruction be clear and after I finish I have a quality product to hold my dumbbell . it be a matter of be organize and patient . I use my dummbbell three to four time a week . the stand be essential . when work with 45 pound in each hand , pick these dumbbell off the floor be ask for a pull lower back . the Bowflex dumbbell and the stand be excellent . nautilus suck .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I receive a shake weight for Christmas this year , and I be impressed ! it do seem quite heavy and bulky at first , but now two month later I can most definitely tell the difference in my arm and shoulder . I be plan on send they to everyone next year ! -lrb- ... -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	why do I buy into this fad ? well , the concept behind the weight be actually ingenious . I have be use it for the past month and have see tremendous result . the six minute a day work into my schedule and my arm , back , and shoulder have never look this good .
Dumbbell	POS	5	read a review that say that this product be great to tone specific muscle but will not help a person loose weight . Perfect for those who be already fit who be always look for way to look better or maintain they body . after a few minute of try it out it become clear how it definitely work . good purchase .
Dumbbell	POS	5	Easy to assemble . very sturdy . overall a great value , especially with free shipping . you will be hard press to find another dumbbell rack that be equally well-built and better price .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy this product shortly after break up with my girlfriend to get more `` exercise '' . I truly enjoy the workout although I tend to fall asleep pretty quickly after I be do . however , this product be useful in more way than one . on a recent hike trip in Yellowstone , I kill a charge bear with the shakeweight . BEST MONEY I have ever spent !!!
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I be very excite to try the Shake Weight after read the review when it work for people . I try both the 6 minute video and simply shake it , as long as I could go , and unfortunately I do not see result . while I be do the exercise I could `` feel '' it , but I never actually see result . which be a real bummer , because I commit to the six minute video every day . I decide to stop when I do not see a difference and because , like someone else mention in they review , the shoulder action give I serious pain . as soon as I stop use the Shake Weight , the pain go away . though it do not give I the result I want , I really hope it work for you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be go to my local masseuse for a while now and I always try to tip she well , but lately she have be a bit lazy and just have not be give I the best massage at all . I be give she this for she birthday -lrb- she say she be a leo -rrb- , in the hope that my next tuus na body rub session be more satisfying and she muscle more in shape when it count .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be very skeptical before buy this . I have be work out use standard dumbell but never be able to get a clear definition on my arm . I buy this and after 2 week , I can see my triceps come out of under the layesr of fat . I always have a challenge with biceps show up . . but if I keep work relegiously , I be sure I will see some bicep muscle in a couple month . this be much better than dumb bell and all the curl I have be do . effective product .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be so sorry to hear that some people be hurt themselves with this item . I have have no problem at all with it and I be very happy with it . I be so bad about do thing consistently and almost do not get this just because I figure it would end up sit around gather dust remind I of what I should be do to get in better shape before it be all down to my ankle . but I have no problem find the time to work out with this . who do not have 6 minute ? it be definitely a work out and I can feel it afterward but not in a bad way . I do not do the behind the head thing for the first several day - perhaps a week or more of use it daily - until I feel more confident with the item itself and comfortable with how it work and shift and all that . then I do not push it because you can feel that you be work on area that usually do not get much attention . if you do it right and as someone else mention `` listen to you body '' you can actually work out stress kink in you neck . I stretch with it in my hand first and I do long slower movement with it at first too to sort of loosen up . just like before any exercise - you should get you muscle warm up first . you should never just jump right in and do vigorous exercise or any exercise you have never do before without test the water first anyway . only you know you body and what it be strength and weakness be . I tend to have problem in my right arm and hand so I try and build up the strength in that arm by do shorter work out with it but more often . since I be horribly right handed - my right hand take all the abuse and all the activity so my left arm be worthless too but in a different way - I work that one out for longer stretch though not as many time during a workout as the right . I end up do they both about the same I just spread out the right one more so I do not aggravate exist problem there and hopefully strengthen it so that the muscle will be stronger and less susceptible to minor tweak and twinge . my arm be get icky flabby even though I be relatively active just because I be not a spring chicken anymore -lrb- though I 'll deny it if you say it out loud to my face -rrb- and they be look - oh i do not know - weird ... lol - but they look so much better now . I swear by this product . just do not go crazy with it right away and do not try and do what the fitness freak do unless you be already one . do what you know you can do and then just push the envelope at you pace a little more everyday . I increase my rep by at least 5 or 10 every work out . now I extend the length of the whole work out itself . I have even start use it to work different area that make my back feel great . oh and this be probably obvious yet it never hurt to mention this - you should really make sure you always drink plenty of water and especially after a work out . that help you muscle too - a lot !!! it really can not be overstate . -lrb- no - I do not work for any organization affiliate or associate with this product -rrb- .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I buy the set , because my trainer have the elite set , which I like . I receive the set damage - plastic be break and plate be off on one of the block . fortunately , Amazon take the set back ; however , I do try the block that be not damage , and it do not feel as sturdy as the elite set . I be surprised especially with all its great review . I end up reordering the 45 lb set instead .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I go to mall and try it . it be kind of fun . right away I come home and get a bottle of water ... who know , it work the same !! just make sure the water have to be very very full . I fill up to half of cap . and you know what ? you can even do two hand with 2 bottle at the same time . it be free
Dumbbell	POS	5	I agree with the other review ... this work great ! my upper arm have become more and more flabby over the year , and within just a few week , I see a shocking improvement . I also do the 6 minute workout daily -lrb- because of the positive result , I be very motivate to keep do it -rrb- , and mostly while watch tv , since it be a easy routine to remember . I also take it on vacation with I , since it do not take up that much room . I have see the absurd comment about it be suggestive , but honestly , do not most excercise look silly when you be do they ? this work great , and I be convince to buy it because the main site offer to not only return the purchase and shipping price , but pay for return shipping if you want to return it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	when I first hear about the shake weight dumbell , I think it be a joke . then I read about it and watch the video and see that it would work in the area that my arms\/shoulders need help with . I find it available thru Amazon.com -lrb- the actual shake weight site be too much $ $ $ -rrb- . when I use the dumbell , I can really feel the arm -lrb- upper , lower , flabby part -rrb- truly be get the muscle go and I have notice some tone since begin with it . 6 minute a day do not sound like a lot , but when you start with this and have not work on you arm in a very long time , it feel tiring and as if you have be work those arm for a hour or so . I think I begin at 2 minute a day and have to reach the full 6 minute in interval over a 15 minute period : -rrb- -lrb- if I be much younger , I probably would not really need something like this to tone my arm and upper body , but be in my 50 's , this seem to work for I . -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	4	nothing fancy , but these will definitely get the job do . the best part of the deal be the very reasonable shipping charge for the pair .
Dumbbell	POS	5	read through all of the review both good and bad . the good be this be a extremely durable and stable rack . it be build solid and hold what it be design to hold . Hexagon dumbbell pair be arrange as follow : top rack , 20-25-30 , middle rack , 35-40-45 , bottom rack , 50-55 and a single adjustable dumbell with 60 lb on it . feel sturdy with all this weight -lrb- ~ 660 lb -rrb- and have be in service for a few month now . I decide to put my lighter weight -lrb- 5 , 8 , 10 , and 15 on a small and much cheaper make Gold 's Gym Christmas tree rack from Walmart . agree with some of the packaging issue be sub-par . one of the sticker on the rack be all chew up from shift around but not really a bother to I . overall , I be very pleased for the price .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	this be a interesting piece of equipment . it do what it say , but there be not much to do with it . there be a limited amount of exercise to do with it . I think you could use this to add to you regular routine . it be nice that it be inexpensive , so add it to you collection of equipment be not a big deal . I would recomend this to someome who want to add some variety to they regular workout .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	it seem from what I have read so far , for many people this product produce some sort of positive result and I will not dispute that . but for the other who write the bad review they word should not be take so lightly or even callously berate . the tv ad be misleading . I do not think anyone expect the weight to shake on its own , `` do the workout for you '' as many critical commenter have claim . but the tv commercial give the illusion that a initial shake must be initiate by the user and some sort of centrifigul method would take over and it would be the responsibility of user to tensely hold the weight use the require muscle need to stabilize it only to find you can not stabilize it , thus cause rapid muscle growth . well it just do not work that way . you have to constantly shake the weight yourself , and I find that a very couterproductive way to permanently build muscle . even in the best of the review nobody really rave about this product so I can not see the logic as to why they rate this 5 or even 4 star . go figure . update 1\/21\/2012 . alright I see this sit on the shelf at Walgreen 's a long time ago and I ignore it . then I go to CVS . on the same day ! again I see one lone Shake Weight for Men sit knee high on the shelf . I walk away . but the thought pursue I . be this fate ? should I buy it or not ? will the person at the register laugh at I ? will it offer some sort of benefit ? so I cave in and buy it . when I get home and open it inside there be a dvd on how to use this thing properly . the goal be to shake the weight vigorously steadily and firmly without wobble it for 30 seconds per exercise . the best I can get be 22 seconds . when you use the Shake Weight properly it will make a whooshing noise . if you hear a kadunk kadunk kadunk you be do it wrong ! as for the benefit themselves , that be just simply go to depend on you own current physical condition . for I I find the Shake Weight to be great for warm up before real exercise or for add a quick firm-up AFTER real exercise .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I number of the review note that this thing be very difficult to put together . I do not find that to be the case at all . follow the direction and it be a snap . well , maybe not a snap , it take I 45 minute while I be watch tv . one great piece of advice that come from another review be crucial . there be three different set of bolt that be very close in length . Make sure you line these bolt up and use the correct length for each use . if you blow it here it could be a very long , frustrating operation . perhaps this be where people be go wrong with this rack ? if you have the Bowflex barbell , you really should get this rack .
Dumbbell	POS	4	exercise with the Shake Weight make you look ridiculous . it be true . but forget about that . the first time you manage to finish the six-minute workout routine , you 'll realize just how effective it be . the Shake Weight be not motorize , however , which many people seem to expect -lrb- even I do -rrb- . you be the one generate the motion of the dumbell . you be the motor . the dumbbell itself be well-constructed and obviously much easier to use and store than just about any other piece of home gym equipment . at only five pound , I do not have high expectation for the kind of workout this thing would produce - but I be definitely please with the result . even after only three week of do six minute a day , I have see improvement . my triceps be more solid , and I be start to get a bit of bicep definition . it be a pretty good feeling get noticeable result from just six minute a day ! the bottom line be that for $ 30 , you do not have to worry about look ridiculous . just try it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I recently get this dumbbell rack and could not be happier . I have two cat and dumbbell range from 5 to 45 lb . anyone who have cat know that that combo be a recipe for great gob of cat fur collect under the weight and no matter how often you vaccuum or sweep , it somehow manage to recongregate . this rack get all the dumbbell off the floor , prevent the collection of fur and other dirt , and make the weight a lot more accessible . the one comment to add to those of the other here be that this rack really only work well with hexagonal dumbbell . I have two round-bell 10-pound dumbbell and when I try to place they on the rack , they slip off and fall . so I have have to replace they . I prefer the hexagonal anyway , but if you have nothing but round-bell weight , you might want to look at a different design . but if you have the standard hexagonal , you 'll love this . it be compact , solid , and surprisingly solid for the price . plus , if you be a Amazon Prime member , it will ship for free , which be pretty amazing give its weight . I highly recommend this rack .
Dumbbell	POS	4	it do actually work . you will feel the burn right from the begining . you 'll start do it and think this be not so bad , but after 15-20 seconds you start to feel it . the dvd really be only a $ 1 value in my view as it do not really add any benefit that the enclosed booklet do not tell you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	have work out at several gym for the past 2 year or so , these be the most versatile dumbbell I have encounter . now that I be in graduate school , I do not have as much time to drive to the gym , so I make a little home gym and add these to my collection . these weight be AMAZING . at first , I be a bit skeptical of the idea of square dumbbell , but the shape do not interfere with most exercise that you 'll be do . honestly , within 2 day , I be about to set the weight on these dumbbell within seconds . simply slide the pin in and out . I find these far more convenient than have a whole set of traditional dumbbell . I definitely recommend this product .
Dumbbell	POS	5	over the past two to three year I have buy pair from 10 lb . to 60 lb . I have be very happy with they . they be solid , the handle have a slightly checkered grip which be nice when you hand be sweaty . if you have look at other manufacturer 's you may have notice the size of comparable weight can vary , less costly weight be usually larger than the cap 's . the cap weight be a reasonable size until you get beyond 60 lb , in that case , well , they be just plain big .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I receive what I purchase with this . it be a 20 lb dumbbell . the only thing I be not happy about be that it be only sell as a single dumbbell instead of a pair . I misunderstand this when I order . I like the grip and it seem like the hex shape be easier to use than other dumbbell .
Dumbbell	POS	5	my yorkie be very picky about she treat but she love these . they keep she busy chew which be a nice break from the whining ! anybody who have ever own a yorkie know how much attention they will demand from you ... these treat give she something to do when I need to get thing do . love they !
Dumbbell	POS	4	very nice quality . love the color . easy to grip . recommend it for anyone who want something bright-colored and cheery to use during they workout !
Dumbbell	POS	5	after read some of the review , I be concern that put this together would be a pain , but I enter cautiously , make sure to keep the 2.5 inch bolt separate from the 2.75 inch bolt and the 3 inch bolt , then just follow the direction make sure to use the correct piece . construction really take only about 45 minute . I be one who usually do not follow direction during assembly , or at least use they as a last resort , but after read the review , I decide to follow they this time and construction be a breeze . do not let the other review scare you away . now for the stand ... very solid , perfect height . you do not want to have to pick 50 pound off the floor , so these stand be essential to save you back . I be tall -lrb- 6 ' 3 '' -rrb- , and the height be perfect . I have no worry that the stand will last forever . the weight be awesome too ! if you be serious about work out , invest in this and you will not regret it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the dumbell set be perfect for begin weight user and\/or for light weight . the rack be easy to assemble and the weight themselves be ergonomic and comfortable to use .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this only take I 45 min to setup and be straightforward . the only reason I gve 4 star be it be pricey for what it be , but be good relief for back and quick p90x weight change .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be work out at home with p90x for about 4 week prior to purchase this stand . I have to say that the ability to not struggle and strain my back be definately worth the price .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be look for a rack to organize we small workout area but could never find something that I think be build well for less than $ 100 until I find the apex rack . this rack exceed my expectation for quality , construction and ease of assembly . and Amazon continue to amaze I with they great service ... I receive the rack in two day and shipping be free . what a deal !
Dumbbell	POS	5	the weight come quickly and we be better than I could have expect . I use they everyday and have see no wear or issue with they what so ever . the stand look really flimsy when I first take it out but it be small and lightweight but defiantly do the trick . altogether it be the perfect set for my home workout .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy these to start the p90x program . not be very athletic , I think the 3-24 pound weight would be enough . they be solid and well design . change weight be a snap . although they be fine start out , I realize that I would quickly outgrow these weight as I progress through the workout series . 24 pound seem like a lot of weight if you have not be lifit before but after a few week you will wish you have more resistance on some exercise . I return these and get the Powerblock Sport 5.0 that cover 5-50 pound instead . they be both great product , vastly superior to the rubber band for p90x -lrb- which be ok as a last resort , but free weight be much more challenging and provide a better workout -rrb- . if you plan on do less weight and more rep , then the 3-24 pound set may be appropriate .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this rack work perfectly for my hex dumbbell from 20-50lbs . the smaller weight do not fit as well but since they be lighter , I be not that concern with pinch a finger between the weight and the rack .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the Apex Deluxe 3-Tier Dumbbell Rack be well make . the weld be good and its easy to put together ; it take I about 10 minute to assemble . a great buy .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	after read a ton of review I finally give into curiosity and buy the shake weight . and while many of the review who talk about feel a burn be correct I think it be important to consider the situation of the user make the review -lrb- which be not always clear -rrb- . for I , I work out a couple of time a week at a normal gym use mostly free weight that be a lot heavier than the shake weight , I have honestly find the shake weight routine to be a good way to get a bit more of a muscle burn . however , I do not feel that the weight itself create a lot more resistance than do high volume rep at weight that be 5-10 lb less than you normal set . that say , my girlfriend who do not do a ton of free weight work and instead focus she work out on cardio and yoga get a really strong burn and be even sore the next day . thus far she be find that the shake weight have seemingly be pretty effective as a addition to she routine and something that be very valuable . point being , different people will get totally different result . personally , I think the product be pretty interesting and I 'll probably continue to use it at longer interval , but I honestly do not think you 'll end up look like the fitness trainer if this be all you do . also I might feel differently if there be a slightly heavier version of the product or on that require more effort to shake .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	from read previous review I be dread the assembly of this stand . to my surprise , the instruction be clear and easy to follow and I have the stand put together in just under a hour . after assembly the stand I notice the stand be very sturdy and well build . I take my Bowflex SelectTech 552 weight out of the holder and place the holder in the stand . upon do so the holder do not fit right in the stand . they be a bit to wide and long . to fix this I use a hand towel and a adjustable wrench . place the hand towel over the rear edge , I use the pliers to bed they back and inch or so . its important to do the rear edge because the front one hold all the weight . they dont fit perfectly but they do now fit in the stand . overall I be very happy with the strength and look of the stand but wish it would have take no modifying .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I think I be get a bargain . these be great dumbell , but they be 30 % cheaper locally . I think the mazon price be for a pair . it be not .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	my Aunt tell that she love this thing . it be a stupid . and , I can not believe I buy it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	not much to say really . the price be definitely reasonable and to have it ship right to the front door be nice . when I need heavier one , I will come back here . : -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	the stand be excellent , it hold the dumbell without give or sway even when you body weight lean over the dumbell during position . this be the second stand I have purchase , the first stand hold my 552 dumbell set -lrb- now go on two year -rrb- . very well design for save you back during lifting . the only difference from my previous stand be that this one do not have a chrome finish , otherwise it be great .
Dumbbell	POS	4	the selecttech 552 stand be a sharp look piece of equipment and be easy to set up . do not let some review scare you ... if you can pick up a tool and look at a picture , you can put this together . a little pricey , however , consider what they charge for they dumbell . this stand should be include .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I purchase a shake weight online and the company sell all my information to herbal life . herbal life call I about once a week since I purchase the shake weight ask I to buy pill , etc. . if I have know that the company that sell shake weight do that I would not have give my phone number to be harass nor would I have buy the item . I have ask nicely and also very sternly ; yet they still continue to call . nothing be worth what I be go thru . yes , the product work fine -lrb- thus the one star -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	it work great . it take a little while to get use to it , but my flabby arm start get tone and that what I want .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this be a no-brain-er it do as advertise the only catch be only you have to use it but it do work . not sure about the 4 star rating since the system will not allow any less ...
Dumbbell	POS	4	product arrive quickly . I purchase both this and the Bowflex SelectTech Dumbell stand and I be impress by how heavy\/sturdy they be . assembly for both be a breeze . Bowflex clearly have they act together . if it be I I would have include some form of ` lock mechanism between the base of the dumbell holder and this stand .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I think the purchase be for a pair -lrb- 2 weight -rrb- !! bottom line : it be too expensive for just one dumbell compare to a local sport store -lrb- where I have previously purchase 5 # neoprene weight -rrb- . also the 2nd one be a slightly different color . not a big deal , but annoy . it be a pretty self-explanatory product ... neoprene dumbell . bc it be neoprene , it have a nice grip and protect the weight .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very please with the price and performance . not foolproff but simple check assure no mishap with loose weight .
Dumbbell	POS	4	go to goo gle and type in `` shake weight for man review '' choose the second one under amazon which be world of diet . a small word on use both male and female version of this product if you can not figure out how to find the report . while the woman 's version may be only 2.5 pound it cause resistance measure of 32.5 pound . do the math the male version of 5 pound provide 65 pound of resistance . you be not get the full range of motion you would from a dumbbell but what you be get be 3 time the effect in the shorter motion result in better toning than muscle mass . for everyone that be injure it be because you be treat it like a 5 pound weight . there be spring within this thing that cause the resistance measure to hit up to 32.5 to 65 pound when you shake it . treat it like the resistance machine you find at a gym , that line do not weight 100 pound but through resistance it sure as heck can feel like it and give you the same benefit . that be say its the company fault for not appropriately designate the actual resistance this thing cause . again its simulation review not perform by real people but simulation be use in everything these day and the company have a very accurate simulation from what I can tell . be careful when use this product and by all means start out slow until you positive you can use this without get injure . oh and do not forget to stretch before and after like you suppose to else you will get injure as with any work out equipment . eat healthier and stay away from fake butters\/margine , whole grain\/wheat , corn , banana , fast food , and believe it or not orange juice will cause you to gain weight . you will lose weight and build muscle but do not rely on any one thing to get you to where you want to be . like other have say if you want to really get into shape use this in combination with other thing or wait until you endurance be up to the 3-4 time a day thing . slowly pace yourself and you will get there .
Dumbbell	POS	4	solid , balanced dumbbell . allow I to cancel my gym membership and and work out at home . I have never be a fitness buff so I be not suggest this replace a gym , but for I it be great . I can pop off a couple set in the morning , couple more set at night during a commercial break , do a set of pushup to mix it up , etc. . it add up . one minor ding , fleck of paint have chip off when the end of the dumbbell touch during a workout , which be a little annoying if you be do overhead press , but I be assume that will stop as the paint wear off . I read one review that a dumbbell crack apart during a workout . these be cast metal piece that have be weld together , the odds be low but it be possible , so I do not let they strike together too hard when I be exercise .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I be give this rack as a birthday gift and I be very very happy with it . from a size perspective , its rack be not long enough to hold more than 3 set of big weight , and it do protrude out away from the wall more than what I would have think . but those be some pretty small gripe give the price point . I have mine set up as follow : top rack 8 , 10 , 15 & 20 ; middle rack hold the 25 , 30 & 35 dumbbell , and finally the lower rack have my 40 & 45er . I be kinda uncertain whether I can squeeze in a 50lb set , if I should ever get that strong to need they ... again , I be very pleased with this rack . its size related shortcoming be easily offset by its competitive price point .
Dumbbell	POS	5	it be a workout build the stand but I love it . the stand pretty much save my back during p90x super set . I should have buy it earlier . bring it !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy this item because the physics of it make complete sense to I . I just finish my second time use the shake weight . the first time be right after I open it , and I try the various workout show . it be not too bad . the second time I use it after my daily routine consist of ab work out , push up , dip and pull up . it usually take I 5-10 minute . once I finish , it be 3:56 . I decide to wait until 3:57 so that I could time myself for one minute . I have never want 3:58 to come so badly . it burn not only in my arm but in my ab as well . if use on its own it may not be as effective , however it be a great finishing touch on my workout today . P.S. . you have to be SUPER FRAIL to use the women product . it be half the weight of the man 's . man will build muscle and in turn need to move up in weight . buy the man 's version .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I 'll keep this simple . the weight themselves be weighty . the cover make they easy to hold , and exercise with they be fine . I have absolutely nothing negative to say about they . the stand be basic plastic , but be sturdy and do a fine job of hold the weight in a compact manner . come with a extra screw too , in case one vanish . if you be look for a basic lightweight set like I be , you can not go wrong here .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the Shake Weight do what it claim . it do not take much , but the result be feel immediately . good for different exercise . I will get another . Shake Weight.com
Dumbbell	POS	5	I start the p90x workout a few week ago and begin use the rubber resistance band . however , when I switch to this set of weight the workout become much more challenging . I highly recommend these over the band if possible . change weight be a snap so you can easily keep up with the video . the product feel solid and high quality . yes , there be a price premium for the Powerblocks but they be much quicker than change plate weight and they take up much less room than a set of dumbbell . highly recommend . no offense to Amazon , but due to ship cost , try to buy they locally if you can . I pay $ 269 + tax for the Sport 5.0 set which cover 5-50 pound in 5 pound increment . unless you be a bodybuilder , this weight will cover all the exercise in p90x . and the Sport series can be upgrade to 65 pound if you really must have it .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I recently have a serious back surgery and I be always look for new thing to keep I motivated exercise as it be very important for I to avoid further back problem . the novelty aspect of Shake Weight Dumbbell attract my attention . this weight be a molded plastic handle with a spring at each end that compress and extend as you shake it back and forth . I like they because they add a bit of variety to my exercise routine . however , they be not provide a harder workout or burn more calorie than the traditional weight . a recent consumer report -lrb- July 2011 -rrb- do electrocardiographic study to judge how effective the Shake Weight system be and find that it be not any better than traditional weight . it do not not mean you should not use these weight , the study just clarify that it be not a magic bullet . any resistance exercise build strength and any movement build calorie , and so do Shake Weight system . if the novelty of Shake weight get you exercise it do its job !
