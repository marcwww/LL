CableModem	POS	5	this product be easy to install and result in double my connection speed with Comcast . if you network be wireless , you may need a new wireless router in order to get the higher speed . I pair the Motorola sb6121 with Cisco Linksys ea3500 router because my old router be not compatible with the new modem .
CableModem	POS	5	very good Modem Works Great , if for any reason , you have a very low upload speed after install , call you cable company to adjust they signal for work to the modem docsis 3.0 , -lrb- a lot of cable company still have they signal to docsis 2.0 -rrb- that just happen to I , but after my cable company do the adjustment the modem work perfect .
CableModem	POS	5	I get this install in place of my mot sb5101 ; my isp be Comcast . after test it appear that the -lrb- ... -rrb- yield different result on download from 6mz to 16mz depend on time of day . dsl report test give about a 40 % speed increase . so , it do appear offer superior speed to the sb5101 . also , the error rate on packet reception be significantly lower .
CableModem	POS	5	I be pay 7.00 a month for a old beat up router not worth 5.00 to buy from charter cable I do a lot of online gaming with 2 people always on it . to every one surprise the internet begin to run with lightning speed first time I have ever see my speed that fast then I speed up my system from 15mpb to 30mpb this modem will most surly make a major differnce in you system performance if you have older and outdated modem !! thanks for buy the most current model !! Charles
CableModem	POS	5	just want to send a warn out there for people like I who be not tech savvy with modem - I find out the hard and long way that this modem will not work if you have Comcast internet and telephone . it only have a cable jack and a Ethernet jack -lrb- the Ethernet cable be the cable that run from you computer or router to the modem -rrb- . for Comcast voice , you need a telephony cable modem that have a cable jack , Ethernet jack , and a phone jack . I discover after a visit to fry that 99.9 % of the cable modem do not have phone jack - 3 of the 4 salespeople I speak with have never even hear of one have a phone jack . however , the best buy that have a Comcast installation center in they do sell the special telephony cable modem -lrb- brand be Arris -rrb- , but it cost $ 150 . I be sure I could have find one cheaper online , but I be pretty do with it by then . the rental fee for the Arris modem through Comcast be $ 7 a month . it would take over 21 month of rental fee to pay off the $ 150 price , and by then something new would be on the market . so I just bite the bullet and rent from Comcast . Hope this info save someone else a day of frustration .
CableModem	POS	4	to keep it short , I can not find anything wrong with this product , in fact it be easy to install and easy to use . I have use it for a month now and it have not give I any issue . I would recommend it to someone look to use it with a 15mbp connection .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this about a month ago because I be sick of rent one ffrom Comcast for $ 7\/month or whatever they be ; plug it in and it work , no issue to date . internet do seem somewhat slow ... though I do not think that have anything to do with modem specifically .
CableModem	POS	4	I recently get Comcast Internet and want to own my own cable modem instead of pay Comcast every month to rent one . Everything go well have to contact Comcast with Mac ID and serial # but after set everything up my modem keep cycling through and the Comcast guy say my modem would go online and then go offline . he think I have a faulty modem and they be go to charge I $ 50 to send a rep out to check if it be a line problem or a modem problem . luckly I google the problem and find that these modem sometimes have a problem with receive too powerful a signal from the cable line and say a attenuator or cable line splitter would do the trick . so I have a line splitter that take the 1 line and split it into 3 seperate line and then it work perfectly with a less powerful signal . Everything work perfectly now and the modem be great but I be surprised Comcast do not suggest to try this since it be a issue that be know .
CableModem	POS	5	this work great with Comcast . I be very pleased with the speed , performance and the easy installation . the size be just right . I hate big and bulky equipment .
CableModem	POS	5	use a infinitv 4 tuner with Windows Media Center -lrb- Windows 7 -rrb- . before add the bda-s1 booster : signal level -26 dbmv snr 26 db after add booster : signal level -6.9 dbmv snr 30.4 db we have intermittent freezing & block on some channel ; those problem disappear when we add the booster . I recommend this for anyone who have low\/marginal signal level and snr .
CableModem	POS	4	when you install this modem , if you be replace a Comcast rental , ensure you have the MAC -lrb- CMAC or HFC MAC -rrb- address handy , and call Comcast first & tell they you want to provision a new modem . after several hour of try to use they webpage that come up , I have to call . also , ensure you have the correct MAC address ; for example , a `` d '' can look like a zero -lrb- `` 0 '' -rrb- w\/those tiny letter , which be my only complaint on this modem so far . otherwise , the modem seem to be work great for I -lrb- though I do have to reset my wireless router and then reboot the modem to get the 2 to work together -rrb- . the modem work fine with my Ooma telo box to provide VOIP ... if you be use comcast-provided voip\/phone or will be , this modem will not work I think ; you need a telephony modem .
CableModem	NEG	1	just get this in the mail . horrible connection and super slow compare to the ARRIS I be rent from Comcast for $ 7\/mo . I be consider keep the rental and suck up the fee just to get decent internet . ca not even stream video from Youtube \/ etc without it buffer every 5 seconds . sad .
CableModem	POS	5	when Comcast decide to do they digital transition , one of the dta would not activate properly . the only advice Comcast offer be to `` remove any splitter . '' that be not really a option without lose cable service to most of the house . after replace the cable run to the problem dta with new cable , I be now able to activate the dta but the signal be still degrade to the point that several of the channel be unusable . internet search indicate that the problem I experience be not uncommon and suggest a amplifier . of course , Comcast will send a tech out to fix , but it be at homeowner 's expense . I be not willing to pay they to fix a problem they create . install amplifier -- quick and easy . there be a comprehensive installation sheet , but it be not really necessary since amp input and output be well mark . before installation , signal strength at the DTA input be about 15db with a s\/n ratio of about 25 . after install the amplifier , the signal level be 1.5 db and the S\/N ratio be 37 . Works great and I do not have to pay Comcast to fix the problem . my only complaint be that I have to do it in the first place . my cable service be not break before they implement they transition . after , I have lose service to two tv -lrb- unless I want to pay they extra for additional dta -rrb- , I have a rat 's nest of wire behind each of the tv where I install dta , and there be no particular improvement in service -lrb- unless you count several additional channel which be completely worthless . -rrb- but this be not about Comcast -- it be about the amplifier . five + star . solidly build , as you would expect from Motorola . if you be have problem after Comcast `` improve '' you service , I highly recommend you take a look at this solution .
CableModem	POS	5	I get a letter from Comcast tell I my modem be out of date and I need to upgrade it . I do some research , find this modem which be on Comcast 's list of suggest modem , and order it . after it arrive , I swap out my old modem with this one , call Comcast customer support , and within 15 minute I be back online . it be easy to install and I be happy with the purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	I have Comcast xfinity . I disconnect my old modem , connect this modem , and then `` re-plugged '' my wireless router . a Comcast installation screen appear on my laptop when I open Explorer . you need you Comcast account number -lrb- on you bill -rrb- , I follow the step , and it work great . I do not need they , but I be keep the number on the bottom of the box .
CableModem	POS	5	I replace a old Linksys modem with this modem and have nothing but good word to say about it . Works great !
CableModem	POS	5	Easy to review -- look at m and COX website to find certified compatible modem -- zoom be the only one -lrb- at the time -rrb- that fit the bill . excellent out of the box experience , no connectivity issue , plenty of through-put . I would buy another , but -lrb- knock wood -rrb- I 'll need to do so !
CableModem	POS	4	this replace my Comcast router with no issue . it be not difficult to set up . acticate online folow the process discribe in the first review . Easy seal , this thing be fast !!!
CableModem	POS	5	the Comcast rep give I a list of cable modem that work with Comcast and recommend Motorola as a brand . it work perfectly on the 1st try . we have only own it a month but no problem to report as of now .
CableModem	POS	4	this solve all the issue I have with my isp . I be call at least once a week because of outage . I plug this in and activate it in a few minute and have not have any issue . well worth it .
CableModem	POS	4	the device be easy to unpack and the cox support guy be great . we have it run in about 5 minute . one problem that prevent I from give it 5 star - the print on the box and device for the MAC address be way too small to read . if I would not have have a magnifying glass , the 5 minute install would have take a hour .
CableModem	NEG	1	I have be use a Motorola sb5120 -lrb- mostly happily -rrb- for a couple of year and plan on upgrade we network start with a new DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem , the Motorola sb6121 . today I just try install my second modem from Amazon after the first give I the cycle-on , cycle-off problem some of the reviewer have mention . sadly the second one be the same , at least for I . I have to conclude either there be 1 -rrb- a batch of defective modem out there , or 2 -rrb- it really be not compatible with Comcast cable in Portland , or . there be no point in order a 3rd . Comcast do not give I any assistance - as per usual , they first suggestion be I buy the ` wrong ' modem -lrb- tho they do not exactly say that , and the website give it all high mark -rrb- , and they attitude be one where I imagine the service tech greet I with `` hello , this be Comcast , how can I help you ? let see we record indicate that you first name be `` Moron '' correct ? yes , I think so ... '' -rrb- -lrb- to be fair , he really do not say that and be rather quite pleasant , he just could not offer any meaningful help . he do even call back to check if I work out my problem -rrb- so apart from my Comcast minus rant , at this point there be no way I can do better than 1 star for the sb6121 though I wish I could . on the flip side , `` thank you Amazon '' for you awesome return policy . this one will be back home with you in a few day .
CableModem	POS	5	hook it up and then spend 10 minute on the phone with Comcast to get new MAC address register . Everything work great . hard to believe I have be pay Comcast $ 5 per month for year when I could get essentially the same equipment for a one time $ 30 fee . the old modem go back to comcast later today .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this to replace a old DOCSIS 2.0 Linksys cable modem\/router . it be easy to install ! I do not even need to use they technical support . it have not give I any trouble since the day i install it . I would certainly recommend it if you be look for a new modem .
CableModem	POS	5	here be my story : I live in socal with Time Warner Cable as my provider . I have 1 line come to the house that be split 3 way : 1 -rrb- strongest signal directly to the modem ; 2 -rrb- one line driectly to the cable box\/dvr in we family room ; 3 -rrb- the third line be split use this Motorola signal booster to 4 other tv . it work perfectly . no signal loss at all to the 4 other tv . prior to this I be use a 3 way splitter I find leave over in my attic . it send the signal to 3 tv but when I add the 4th -lrb- pip on my Family room tv -rrb- the signal degrade alot . add this and now all work perfectly . the power source for this unit be awesome . I have the splitter mount in the attic and run coax to a convenient outlet for power . I highly recommend this if you be splitting signal to multiple tv .
CableModem	NEG	2	I buy this modem after my Motorola Surfboard keep drop out . this one be more stable for the first few month , but after that I notice a sharp decline in my upload speed -lrb- it go from around 2mbp to .15 mbp -rrb- . after fight with my cable company for a few week and try just about everything I could think of to fix the problem , I finally decide to try switch it out with my old surfboard modem . this fix the issue . there be no doubt in my mind that this modem be the problem . I would not recommend this product and I be currently look for a new modem .
CableModem	NEG	1	the modem be sell as `` new '' but when attempt to connect the modem to my cable account the modem be still tie to another person 's account . I waste three hour try to install a item thatius have no choice but to return and deal with the hassel of return and wait for a replacement .
CableModem	POS	5	this product be unbelievably excellent , in fact , I would like to call it miraculous ! I be previously use a ordinary 4 port digital splitter -lrb- 5-2300mhz -rrb- where my cable modem , wireless router , and 2 t.v. 's be connect . this be ok for about 3 month when suddenly , I get no signal from my cable modem and wireless router , and some channel be miss in both T.V. 's . after some troubleshooting , I find out that the splitter be not work anymore . so I test a spare digital splitter of the same spec , with the same result . frustrated , I purchase another splitter with a narrower range , from 5-1000mhz from best buy . my heart sink when it also produce the same result . I call my service provider to try to get a recommendation as to what type of splitter to use , but they refuse , and attempt to pressure I to let a technician come to we house and do the connection . this , of course , for a stupid extra cost : one for the installation of a new line , and another for a extra monthly charge . I bluntly tell the customer service agent that I will not allow that and should not spend a single cent to troubleshoot the problem . they attempt to pressure I to send a technician to we house miserably fail . finally after research in the internet about similar issue , I come up with many cutomer recommend the use of this product for cable modem and t.v.s. I order this Motorola BDA throuh AMAZON , ask for a 1 day delivery , get it as guranteed by AMAZON , then install it . only after a few seconds , my cable modem , router , and T.V.s respond very well and my problem be solve . my browser become wicked fast , and the quality of picture in both t.v.s be excellent ! there be one customer who say that cable modem should not be amplify - I tell this customer he be dead wrong ! in my case , cable modem do not get any signal , until I install this amplifier . I would highly recommed this product to all customer with similar situation !
CableModem	POS	4	no problem for 2 month now . cheaply build , but work well . it arrive on time and work with Comcast internet provider .
CableModem	POS	5	good product and reliable for the price pay . . work great ... I be a first time user
CableModem	POS	5	my Motorola modem would lose connection intermittently , sometimes for extended period of time . have comcast visit and address problem with line into house and within my house . still have problem with Motorola Surfboard modem . Have have zero issue with this modem .
CableModem	POS	5	I recently move into a new home and sign up for Comcast but really do not want to lease a modem so I decide to buy my own . I check eBay but it end up be cheaper she on Amazon . Gotta love Prime . Comcast come and set everything up and it have not skip a beat since I plug it in . I would definitely recommend this modem ...
CableModem	POS	5	I want to cut down my monthly Comcast bill and one part of the bill be a monthly rental fee for the cable modem . Amazon have several DOCSIS 3.0 modem available , but I could not see any substantive difference in they , so I go with the one just like what Comcast provide to cut down on potential issue . this one work fine out of the box ; I just have to call Comcast and give they the MAC address print on the bottom of the modem -lrb- I actually have to give Comcast the MAC address again when I return the rent modem , but that be a Comcast fail -rrb- . the ubee work just like what I have before , with no monthly rental charge , so I be happy .
CableModem	POS	5	I be just hope to get fewer disconnect than with my comcast supply cable modem . I be very impressed when it be finally activate -lrb- chat + call to Comcast -rrb- and I get a `` bond '' downstream connection . it also have a gigabit connection to you pc or lan which be nice but still over kill unless you can max this thing out at 160mbp . I do not max mine out but I do double my download speed and reduce my ping by 1m . I visit speedtest dot net before and after I change to this sb6121 modem . result : original Comcast Supplied Ambit U10C018 Cable Modem -lrb- Docsis 2.0 -rrb- Avg Ping - 7m Avg Download 10.42 Mbps Avg Upload 3.62 Mbps NEW Motorola SB6121 Cable Modem -lrb- Docsis 3.0 -rrb- Avg Ping - 6m -lrb- -1 m -rrb- Avg Download 20.62 mbp -lrb- +10.20 mbp -rrb- Avg Upload 3.62 mbp -lrb- +0.10 mbp -rrb- plus I can return the `` rent '' Ambit modem and hopefully shave off a few buck from my monthly bill .
CableModem	POS	4	this device work right out of the box . . grant I have to work with the cable service provider ; have to provide MAC address . have be work w \/ out failure since put on-line over a month ago . I would highly recommend this product for any cable internet customer . I have it in a open-air arrangement and have no trouble with overheating .
CableModem	POS	5	get a use Motorola dsl modem sb5100 but do not come with the power supply . get this replacement and it work perfectly , no problem what so ever , and it come with a unbitable that price .
CableModem	POS	5	I have be use it for 3 month and it work better than the modem comcast give I . speed be good thanks to the docsis 3 and it never need rebooting . thanks Amazon !
CableModem	POS	5	replace a Comcast Scientific Atlantic modem -lrb- lease for $ 7 per month ... -rrb- with this DOCSIS 3.0 modem which be the highest recommend and certify on the Comcast site -lrb- https:\/\/customer.comcast.com\/help-and-support\/internet\/list-of-approved-cable-modems\/ -rrb- . my speed be now 20mbps d\/l and 4mbp u\/l -lrb- base on speakeasy\/speedtest which I understand may not be the most reliable -rrb- . I be happy with that since I only subscribe to the `` Performance Starter '' level of internet service from comcast\/xfinity -lrb- $ 45.95 \/ mo in ag , Georgia . -rrb- . so at the former $ 7 per month lease , this cable modem will pay for itself within a year . it have be quite reliable and my only reservation be the amount of heat it generate relative to the previous , smaller-size cable modem .
CableModem	POS	5	I read all the posting on the Motorola sb6121 and decide to give it a shot . I be pleasantly surprise . I call my Comcast technical help and they get my MAC address instead of the S\/N id as state in some other post . within a minute I be online . unless there be something out there that be go to jump at I later , I believe this be a great product and worth the money . it work very well with my Medialink Wireless-N Router .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this modem to use with comcast . you can not activate the MODEM THROUGH the ACTIVATION SCREEN that pop up , you must call COMCAST YOURSELF . save time and just call they , take about five minute to get it activate . no problem so far , the modem do not get hot just a little warm , and there be a speed small increase in internet speed . this be a good modem ; it 'll pay for itself in 12 month . would recommend .
CableModem	POS	5	only have this modem for a week , but it have be rock steady so far . only problem I have with installation be I misread a d as a 0 in the MAC address because of they tiny size . once I catch that error , it go smoothly . I dont know why they make the digit so small ! -lrb- and yes I do have my glass on , but you need a magnifer glass ! -rrb- have read several report of this unit run hot , but I dont find that to be true . at least it run cooler than the cable company supply Aires modem . very happy so far .
CableModem	POS	5	we buy the zoom modem\/router . it take a long time to figure everything out and get it setup , but once install we be happy for about two week . then it start drop the signal and not connect . we call Zoom and they suggest take it back , so we do . we try a Motorola and then back to another zoom . finally someone tell we about change the channel setting , and now the zoom work great , very fast . info about change the channel setting : theinfopond.com\/pg-modem-router.html#channel
CableModem	POS	5	I have not update my modem in quite a while , probably two year . these new DOCSIS 3.0 modem really make a difference . I have see a significant increase in internet speed . look nice and solid too .
CableModem	NEG	1	set up a new Comcast account , I have go through two attempt with Motorola modem . the first be the sb6020 , which be DOA -- would not even power up . send it back and decide to try the sb6121 , to see if they newer model perhaps have better quality control . I think I be go to have success -- the light come on -- but no luck . the first strike against this modem come when I call Comcast to try to do a `` self-install '' to save the service charge of the technician come out . in we new place , I know the previous tenant have use Comcast , so I be sure the house be already wire correctly . Comcast be unable to do a self-install over the phone for this modem , so a technician be send out . the Comcast technician , a nine-year veteran installer , spend over a hour fight with the sb6121 , try to get it to initialize . we wire it in directly , remove all splitter , etc. . . and it still refuse to recognize . keep cycling and drop service . I spend another hour on the phone with Motorola tech support , who be unable to help . finally , as a last resort , the Comcast technican plug in a similar Docsis 3.0 modem from he truck . the connection be up and work in seconds , with a stable signal and no drop service . of course , I be now fight with Comcast over the $ 99 service charge for the technician . all tell , this modem have cost I 3-4 hour of my life and $ 99 already ... and this be my second return of a Motorola modem to Amazon in less than 10 day . and I still need a modem . with the dubious quality of the current generation of Motorola modem , they have lose I as a customer for the forseeable future . if the next model be better , I 'll revisit the issue but for now , the aggravation and expense just be not worth it .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem solve my problem . the issue be I be loose connection on my surfboard I have have for year . have my cable company check the street , and I run some neutralize test to issolate the problem to my Surfboard , get this thing , and all be well . the lesson here ? buy a Modem be cheaper than rent , duh ! , but have a modem for 4-5 year you have to remember that technology have a shelf life , and I reach mine a month ago with that surfboard .
CableModem	POS	5	Amazon : shipping be fast and free . Modem : it work great with Comcast in Chicago . I buy the ubee modem instead of the Motorola sb6121 or sb6120 because of the negative review the Motorola modem receive on Amazon . it take I 30 minute on the phone with Comcast to get the ubee modem connect . I save $ 30 with self-installation . the internet be very fast with the ubee .
CableModem	POS	4	very easy to setup out of the box but documentation a bit lack in explanation of configuration and feature . I guess it be assume you already know how to configure you modem . I do have a problem with a older hp\/compaq laptop run m Vista . it would not connect to internet use WPA or PSK , try every thing I read in variuo blog but nothing work . discover there be a update for the Atheros WiFi Adapter , download and install it - connect perfectly now . very fast 20mb download speed . very please with product .
CableModem	POS	5	order this modem for Comcast service up here in Boston and it work great . packaging be minimal but sturdy , modem itself perform well .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this because my cable signal for internet be not stable at all . during the rainning day or windy day , I get no connection . after install this , it significantly improve my connection . however , when the incoming signal be way too low , it still can not solve the problem . however , I can immediately feel the difference between with and without this booster . I even buy a second one as a Chrimstmas gift to my friend , which he also feel the improve of the signal .
CableModem	POS	5	prior to purchase this modem i do some extensive research . there be several excellent modem on the market but i choose this one because of the exceptional speed , reliability and stability it offer .
CableModem	POS	5	I have internet service thru Charter , and purchase this modem to replace the Charter rental unit . it be easy to install , and come with everything I need .
CableModem	NEG	2	I be sure the Motorola surfboard  sb6121 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem be a very capable modem consider it be a Motorola product ; however , I have to put 2 star to get people attention . the Motorola surfboard  sb6121 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem be not yet on COMCAST 's list of support modem . I think that wait 4 month since the release of this product would give COMCAST time to obtain the software require to add the sb6121 to they network . well , I be wrong . it be a shame to give this product 2 star when I never even get the chance run it through its pace . I would rather give COMCAST 2 star for be lazy . the COMCAST tech that come to setup my modem say that the COMCAST system identify my modem ; however , that be about it . he connect a different modem to show I that modem on the list will work . he say that he have a  Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem  so unfortunately , I have to return the sb6121 and I order the sb6120 . I be not slam Amazon or this product . I just want to make COMCAST customer or future COMCAST customer aware that the sb6121 will not work on the COMCAST network YET .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this modem when I move into my new apartment . I be read review that some people could not get this modem to work with Comcast as they isp but I have not have any issue so far . during my research I buy this modem for three reason : - DOCSIS 3.0 - simplicity - affordable like the other reviewer I use a Medialink Wireless N Router - 802.11 n and they make a lovely pair .
CableModem	POS	5	the seller package this item very carefully and ship it post haste . the product be excellent and do what it be advertise to do . the price be excellent and I recommend they highly . I have a long run of coax from the cable provider to the last tv set on the line and this device fix the problem of all tv in the house not receive the identical channel . it be easy to overlook the lose of signal in the wire . this device compensate very well . I highly recommend it .
CableModem	POS	5	this be the 2-port version of the  Motorola Signal Booster  so who need one of these thing ? anyone who be have difficulty receive a consistent cable tv or cable modem signal be a candidate for this amp , but first check with you cable company to confirm that they have do all they can , in term of get high quality cable and splitter into you home . if they have do that , and you still notice frequent outage of you cable internet service , or pixelated -lrb- distorted -rrb- image on live or recorded tv show from cable , then you may very well need a drop amp like this one . the amplifier be particularly helpful if you be splitting a cable signal come into you house to multiple room for multiple tv feed -lrb- and this be perfectly legal to do , per the Cable Act of 1992 -rrb- . any time you split a cable signal , you lose approximately 3 db -lrb- decibel -rrb- of signal strength . split a signal enough time and it can cause you to lose you cable modem feed or get sporadic distortion on you digital cable channel . insert a cable amplifier like this into you cable feed right where it enter the home and it will boost the signal enough to survive multiple split and , in most case , will allow you to enjoy a glitch free cable tv signal throughout you home . why be this amp 's `` two-way '' or `` bi-directional '' feature important ? a two-way feed be necessary in order to support a cable modem -lrb- upload\/download -rrb- and to support interactive cable service such as ppv -lrb- pay per view -rrb- . this amp will not work miracle . again , always check you incoming signal , cable and connector quality first . but if you have do all that and be still have trouble , this little cable signal amp can be a real life-saver . it also work fine for OTA -lrb- over the air -rrb- hdtv signal distribution , but only if you be start with a decent quality signal to begin with . a full review of the Motorola Signal Booster be available on big Picture Big Sound 's web site .
CableModem	POS	5	upgrade a old motorolum Docsis 2.0 modem to this one after a note from comcast say i wasnt get full speed . seem faster and stay connected better .
CableModem	POS	5	Booster be easy to install and work as expect . allow I to add two more tv without interfere with my phone and internet over cable .
CableModem	POS	5	have read through all the previous review , be a bit concerned I would have to be on the phone with Comcast all night get this set up . not true . plug it in , attach Apple wireless router , call Comcast and give technician MAC ID , he say give it 10 to 15 minute , hang up phone - internet be work ! and at blaze speed , mind you . we have not think much about upgrade since we be not have any problem , per se -lrb- we stream music , play online game , surf , watch and record cable , etc - sometimes all at once -rrb- , but a friend at work have mention that he receive a letter from Comcast state he modem be out of date and suggest he upgrade to DOCSYS 3.0 . so we take the plunge too , since we could not recall how old we modem be . previously , streaming music would sometime have to re-buffer , Netflix streaming would cut out , would get disconnect from online game ... . we blame the provider at the time but no more ! not one problem with connectivity since we install this ! one bit of advice for Comcast subscriber - try to get to a Tech support person . I punch in that I have trouble with my internet , that get I to a technician ... since there do not seem to be a straight `` press 3 for tech support '' option . all he need be the MAC ID , which be on the device itself or the box it come in .
CableModem	POS	5	receive modem before due date , and the price be right ! it be easy to install and setup with Comcast within minute . I have have it for 3 week and have see zero hiccup so far .
CableModem	POS	4	I purchase this to avoid pay $ 7\/month rental to Verizon - at $ 80 , this will pay for itself in 1 year . the installation be easy , but I have to contact Verizon and provide they with information about this modem so that they could configure my account . the direction actually state that the cable supplier may need information about the modem so I give they credit because direction for computer equipment be usually pretty poor . I have have this about 1 month and the it have work well ; as stable as the modem I be rent from Verizon .
CableModem	POS	5	my current cable company offer the option to buy a ` approve ' modem or rent one from they and pay a monthly fee . I have have to deal with the cable company 's rental modem before : after have my surfboard for a month I can attest that the upfront cost be absolutely worth it ! I have have this for a month and I have not have to call my cable company and sit on hold for hour wait for a reset on the line yet : my first month on a rental be a nightmare , I assure you . with a good router , this be a fast and reliable modem . it also happen to be a rather attractive and simple design - it be not over do and it be certainly not as unattractive as a lot of other modem : -rrb-
CableModem	POS	5	very easy to install . i run 3 tv on it and it improve picture by 33 % . i have cable at my camper and get 80 channel analog . this help alot . thank you motorolum .
CableModem	POS	5	the sb6121 be a great update to the Surfboard sb4200 that I use previously especially since my cable provider warn I that I be about to lose my service due to obsolescence . the sb6121 be smaller much better ventilate and look better in the black case . the price be good and the sb6121 be east to install . unfortunately the unit have a external transformer that add one more to the mass of transformer power my other component . the indicator light be on all the time green and blue . the flash orange connection indicator light be a little strange but I have get accustomed to it . I would recommend this cable modem to someone .
CableModem	NEG	1	buy this modem because of how well supposedly it work with Comcast and think I could avoid the $ 7.00 rental fee every month . so after follow the ` easy ' instruction , I have no internet access , my network can not be find and there be absolutely no support . Comcast could not & would not help I because it be not there equipment . so basically I have a $ 85 paperweight . oh and it only take 2 hour to restore the network , reset the router at 1am . I work from home after hour so must be connect .
CableModem	POS	5	own you own modem be the smart way to go . Comcast be charge we $ 5 a month to rent one , it take just 8 month to save money with this modem . -lrb- this modem be on sale when I buy it -rrb- this be the most reliable cable modem I have ever use . I have have it for about two year now and it be still go strong . I can not think of the last time I have a network problem that be the fault of the modem . I do not even reset the modem anymore when have problem , since it be always the router . Pretty amazing for a refurbish modem . it be a shame Linksys brand router be not this dependable . if they be I would be a very happy camper . one downside : this modem use the aging docsis 2 standard , which do not support ipv6 . when isp start to roll out ipv6 you will not be able to take advantage of it with the cm100 . it do not matter at all for normal people because ipv6 support will not be \* require \* for many , many year , but if you be a techie like I and you want ipv6 asap , you be better off get a modem that support it .
CableModem	POS	4	I pick this up from another retailer when the Motorola sb6121 give I problem the thing keep reset . a real pain when play on line game this one be fast and reliable . no problem whatsoever . a small footprint on my desk since I do not need a separate router as well . only hiccup be a standard setting that block against flood of datum attack with the high speed Comcast I get 30m download so it think someone be flood my computer with datum . a email to zoom and they give I the quick answer on what security set to uncheck
CableModem	POS	5	we use cox for high speed internet and this modem give we great speed and reliability . since I install this modem we have not experience any issue with access the internet .
CableModem	POS	5	we have be use cable splitter before and most of we tv have very poor reception and grainy picture & some do not get any reception at all ! now , all we tv have excellent reception and better picture . it really boost !!!
CableModem	NEG	1	my modem have many issue , it will randomly reboot throughout the day . when the modem decide to work it be great , but a lot of disconnect issue on the modem end . want to add Amazon let I return this item , buy a new one with Free 1 Day shipping . Modem be run as advertise now . thank you Amazon !!
CableModem	POS	5	I have charter cable and I go from average 20m to 30m . you have to actually call Charter Cable to complete the set up . set up take about 30 minute total .
CableModem	POS	4	pro : at the time of write this review , I have have this modem plug in and run for a month straight without any problem . I get the correct speed from my modem -lrb- 20 mpb -rrb- and I have not experience any latency problem -lrb- pc and xbox 360 gaming be always fluid -rrb- . con : the modem do not have any management capability . access the modem management page -lrb- 192.168.100.1 on most home network -rrb- only give you status page and no capability to spoof MAC address or provide isp with a username and password . Make sure you isp support this modem before you buy it . conclusion : for the money -lrb- less than $ 80 -rrb- this be a great modem that may not have frill but have reliability which be far more important . I would recommend this modem -lrb- as long as you isp support it -rrb- .
CableModem	NEG	2	buy it for my mom last fall because my brother -lrb- the electronics geek -rrb- say dont get two separate unit ... so I take back the two separate unit that work well , and get this nightmare . as soon as we hook it up it begin reject any and all other device . spend over three week off and on -lrb- approx 25 hr -rrb- with tech support , finally accept internet through cable tv . it be still reject the brand new printer\/fax machine that be also suppose to be compatible . I wish I just leave well enough alone . the space she save be not worth the hassle , and it cost I $ 10 more than the other unit .
CableModem	POS	5	I have try cable tv amplifier in the past but they seem to actually make the picture worse . there be so many cable split in my house for my various tv and device -lrb- TiVo , Media Center PC , etc -rrb- that the analog channel picture quality on many be fuzzy or have distortion and I could not get many unencrypted digital qam channel at all . this both improve to analog channel to as perfect as analog get , and allow I to get the qam channel that disappear after the split !
CableModem	POS	5	I purchase this to replace the stock Ambit modem from Charter Cable . in summary , the modem install flawlessly and I do see a improvment in speed -lrb- accord to dslreports_dot_com I be run twice as fast at time -rrb- . the setup with Charter be very easy , with no phone call need . everything be do online . after insure the modem be work correctly I then install the wireless router -lrb- Belkin n + wirelss router -rrb- . it too , install flawlessly and install easier than with the stock modem -lrb- I often have to start - restart the modem and router before they would communicate . I would recommend this product . it do what it be suppose to , and installation be a breeze .
CableModem	POS	5	I do host through a home server and this modem handle the minor level of traffic well -lrb- if any of the server start take load , I offload they to ec2 -rrb- . run fine , not too hot , and be very simple to setup .
CableModem	POS	5	I get this to use with Comcast cable internet since it be on there approve list -lrb- leave 6 year of crappy att dsl 6.0 Extreme which just seem to get worse and worse as we use it and add on more device -rrb- . Works great and be easy to install . sine it be pair with a Netgear 3700v2 router it be in `` bridge '' mode which Comcast have to do for you , so you can not see any specifics about the modem once it be behind the router , which be expect . I have look at they and it seem to be work very fast with Comcast . we get a clean signal 6-10 m ping , no packet loss and 25mbp down and 4mbp up , which be great since we have 5 computer , 3 PS3 's , 5 pda -lrb- iphone , android -rrb- phone ,5 hd\/dvr Directv reciever with whole home dvr hook up to internet and a att Microcell Tower which which work like VOIP for better cell phone coverage . so you can see we be task this thing and it just keep on go . my 3 kid do a lot of online multiplayer gaming mw3 , battlefield 3 , etc. so we use alot of datum for gaming and Netflix , Vudu video download \/ streaming , last month be 465gb datum use . anyway it work well and have get good review feedback by other .
CableModem	POS	5	Charter just bump we up to 30Mb and this require I get a DOCSIS 3.0 modem and it have be wonderful !!
CableModem	POS	5	make the jump to light speed with this modem and what a difference . have a problem get up and run and I think that be because the Comcast software only give you the choice of they modem to install with . have to call they twice . second time it be a snap to get go . use Netflix with my AT&T; dsl take forever to load . clarity be not great either . with my Cable dsl through this modem it movie start almost immediately and the clarity be HD quality . best yet , I be not spend $ 5 per month to lease they cable modem ! if I have to do all over again I would get up and run use the Cable company modem then switch the next day .
CableModem	POS	5	I also decide to upgrade from dsl , as 1 mbp be the fastest we could get in we neighborhood . I do my due diligence and decide upon the Zoom 5350 , as it be on Comcast 's approve device list and have the requirement to meet we need . installation be very simple . I do not have a self-install kit from Comcast , so I just follow the direction for connect without a kit . I connect the coax cable to the modem , a supply Ethernet cable from the modem to my computer and everything else go very smoothly . I do not have to call Comcast with the MAC address , as everything be recognize during the install . all , in all installation take approx . 10 minute , very simple for anyone to accomplish . both my wireless laptop with b\/g wireless card -lrb- one on a second floor -rrb- find the network and connect without a problem after I enter the wap2 key . I may purchase Wireless-N card later , but I really do not see the need . speedtest show a average of 17 mpb for a wireless connection and 25 mbp for wire . I use the Ethernet port to wire my Blu-Ray player , Wii -lrb- I purchase a wii-lan converter -rrb- and a spare cable if I need to connect a laptop to stream Hulu or Comcast TV online to view through my hdtv . Netflix stream in hd when available -lrb- on Blu-Ray , Wii be only sd -rrb- and look and sound great . we get rid of we cable tv , and purchase the leaf attenna -lrb- see we review -rrb- from Mohu . so all we viewing on local channel -lrb- it find 35 of they -rrb- be free and in hd . if nothing be on that we want to view , we use Netflix , Hulu , or Comcast TV online . we be enjoy the savings , and now with the zoom faster speed , great picture quality as well .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this cable modem from Amazon several week ago to replace a old one supply by the cable company . it be very easy to install and work great without any problem . the advantage be that I no longer have to rent the modem from the cable company and Amazon have the best all around price .
CableModem	POS	5	I be rent the Motorola Surfboard 5120 -lrb- sb5120 -rrb- from Comcast for $ 5\/month . this seem reasonable to I up until I find this modem for $ 30 include shipping . I will make my money back on the purchase in 6 month . excellent deal ! as other have mention all you have to do be call Comcast to activate this modem by give they the MAC address . it be both on the box , and on the unit itself . this process take I a grand total of about 15 minute once I open the box . this modem have plenty of speed out of the box . in response to other 's get up to 30 mb\/s , this be not go to be a cap on the modem 's ability . this instead be a cap limit by you service provider . this be a DOCSIS 2.0 Modem , which mean it can handle up to 42.88 mb\/s raw throughput -lrb- include overhead -rrb- or more simply 38 mb\/s -lrb- usable datum -rrb- . for I , I pay for 12 mb\/s on Comcast , and have see this modem get upward of 14 mb\/s , although this say nothing as to what the modem itself can handle . it be just Comcast not limit I strictly enough to what I have pay for .
CableModem	POS	4	my old Modem have past , it be a rather slow death that be more painful for I than it be for it - this I be sure . so I be on the hunt for a younger better model -lrb- survival of the fittest you know -rrb- - I find one in this product . it work tirelessly and do all that I ask with out question . I highly recommend this type for anyone that feel they be not get what we all should have - great service . delivery be fast and efficient - it have arrive before I though it would actually . hope this help you in you decision
CableModem	POS	4	I just recently buy this modem to update my 5 year old zoom that seem to be have issue turn out it be router that need replace , so I have a Asus 56 on the way . however , I be keep this because it be blaze fast , I notice a huge jump in internet speed almost instantly . I be go to give this four star because it say the light be suppose to be Easy to understand and I be a tech guy and I still do not understand they ... and there be not even a mention of they in the manual ... good job ubee . anyways if a Ubee guy come and comment on my post tell I how to interpret the light you 'll get a 20 % boost and reclaim you 5 star rating .
CableModem	POS	5	I be use this modem with Comcast service . the setup be very easy , although in typical isp fashion the guy on the phone have no idea be be go on . I be able to set up the router with just a phone call , although they make I purchase they ` self-installation kit ' for $ 10 -lrb- I never recieve the kit in the mail -rrb- . but enough rant about Comcast , the modem itself seem to be work very well . I have not experience any drop in service and my speed appear very consistent . I have not do any investigation into my actual speed yet , but everything feel as quick as I would expect from a Docsis 3.0 modem . all in all , I be very satisfied with my purchase , provide it last a few year .
CableModem	POS	5	work great out of box ; easy setup . no dropout in several week -lrb- unlike the Dlink modem it replace -rrb- . it do what it be suppose to do -lrb- act invisible -rrb- ; recommend highly .
CableModem	POS	5	Works seamlessly with my Comcast account . no issue at all after setup . I would recommend this docsy 3.0 version for sure .
CableModem	POS	5	this be a great modem . nothing to do but hook it up , call you cable company to give they the hardware address and wait for they to imput the info . it connect in less than 5 minute .
CableModem	POS	5	receive my ZOOM 5350 3.0 Modem-Router combo today . could not wait to install it . call cox . internet and within minute the ZOOM 5350 be up and run . wait at least ten minute for a tech person come on line to give he the MAC address , etc. . this dude know how to connect with speed to the internet . my old Motorola Surfboard SB5100 modem as become of old age and need replace . my surfboard sb5100 download speed be 22.24 mbp , and upload speed be 3.54 mbp . this zoom 5350 as lighting download speed of 28.56 mbp and upload speed of 8.14 mbp . that be good enough for I and not complain . I 'll report back in couple month for another report .
CableModem	POS	5	Modem be very easy to hook up . love the slim design and the fact that you can either lay it flat or stand it up .
CableModem	POS	4	I purchase this modulator-demodulator -lrb- modem -rrb- for use with my Comcast Broadband Internet Service . it be work well with no complaint , no complaint at all !
CableModem	POS	4	Great , work good pretty easy to hook up and have have no issue . I have be use it for more than a month .
CableModem	POS	5	work like a charm right out of the box ! no fuss , no muss . I have purchase this to extend signal about 100 ' and because of the multiple output port , I hook up short coax cable to the closest tv and dvd recorder as well . Picture quality also improve a lot !
CableModem	POS	5	I have be use this splitter\/amplifier for over a year now . I have two 50 + foot cable run located in different room of we house - one to my hdtv cable box , the other to a cable modem . I can surf through the cable OnDemand catalog , stream show and do network intensive activity -lrb- downloads\/uploads , voip -rrb- simultaneously without a problem . bi-directional performance and the overall connection have be be rock solid . in the past , I have use both electroline and pct splitter\/amplifiers . we have fairly unstable power where I live , with frequent short outage and spike . for both the electroline and pct product , even though they be always plug into surge suppressor -lrb- both the electrical and cable line -rrb- , they eventually blow out . the Motorola have weather a year 's worth of storm and random outages\/spikes and be still run great . do not know if this be just luck or a sign of the high build quality of the device . the connector be solid -lrb- nothing even come close to wiggle -rrb- and the overall build quality appear to be quite high . I have not have to touch it since I install it , so I be a happy camper .
CableModem	NEG	1	have I find this comcast forum post at -lrb- ... -rrb- , I would not have buy dpc3008 . Cisco DPC3000 work fine earlier . now , I have no support for resolve drop connection issue with this dpc3008 . Comcast keep reset and tell no log of any disconnection activity . Cisco on the other hand be not tell what be with the firmware that people be talk on the Comcast forum . both company need to figure out the fix to this problem soon . update -lrb- April 18 2012 -rrb- : Comcast revert back the firmware build date to Aug 11 2011 and it fix the drop connection issue . definitely , this would change my opinion on the product to excellent .
CableModem	NEU	3	to all you naysayer , let start here : this be purchase for use on Comcast . yes , Comcast currently have this very modem on they `` approve '' list ; yes , I do my homework ; yes , I be smarter than a rock ; and yes , Motorola should have do more to insure they product work reliably on such a major provider system . this modem refuse to provision on the network , simple as that . Comcast could see the modem , ping it and send the provision information ... the MODEM refuse it . so do the second modem . I be a big fan of Motorola product but this be disappointing . also , the HFC MAC seem to be all wrong . most mac start 00 and these be start with 74 . I do not know if that contribute to the problem or not though .
CableModem	NEG	1	I buy a refurbish Linksys router and it have work well now for over a year so I feel that buy a refurbish Linksys modem be a fairly safe bet . how wrong I be . as instruct I call comcast to give they the Mac address of the router however could not get the modem to show up with comcast . we try for hour with several different technician and supervisor but to no avail . add to this there be a no return policy for this unit . do not waste you money .
CableModem	POS	5	I receive this item and have make arrangement to cable service start . what I think be interesting be the tech from Comcast say this device be completely unusable since the serial number have be register elsewhere I have to rent a unit from he . after a couple of day , I call the service department and while on the phone he tell I all I need be the MAC address and they would take care of the rest . well , needless to say , the unit work great ! be even able to connect my router to and set up my network with no issue . what be Comcast think ? well , when I get my bill they overcharge I for the service I sign up for and keep the rent charge on the bill after I return they modem . the modem work great and I be glad I make the purchase !
CableModem	POS	5	Have have the same modem for about 10 year and it finally start give I problem . talk to comcast and they say I should change it out and the loss connectivity issue would go away . as well as I get all the speed I be pay for on the internet . for once they where right . connection be simple and no issue along with my dowload speed doubling . my netflix stream alot better on my tv and with the 3 laptop go at the same time everything be run smoothly . I be be cheap not want to upgrade but it be well worth it . the fam be verry happy I break down and do it . Hope this help anyone out there think about the upgrade .
CableModem	POS	5	the modem be smaller than other which be a benefit to I . the modem work with Time warner cable and it set up quickly - can not say the same for time warner . this be important information about set up the modem with you cable company : I have 7 hour worth of call try to set up this modem because hold time be about 30 minute between reps. they will tell you that this be `` not '' a approve device even though it be approve on time warner website and level one tech support . Hang up on the rep who will not set up you modem and call you local office - finally , I do get through to someone who do not even ask for model number and all they want be the MAC and serial number - here be the problem , my device address end with a `` b '' and the rep apparently could not assign a b to the system and take it upon herself to enter a `` 8 '' and never tell I about she change . so , a phone call to tech support and then back to customer service to change a 8 to a b - then back to tech support - it be work perfectly . tip : be certain to tell they you be use a DOCSIS 3.0 modem , that way the `` b '' will be accept . and then ask they to repeat the MAC address and DOCSIS version prior to end the call . you will save about 5-6 hour in phone call . additionally ; I do have digital voice and Tech support on `` that day '' say that none of the telephony modem work with Time Warner . they have ask I to pick up a free splitter and two short coaxial cable from the local time warner office so that I can connect both device . once both device be connect , time warner say they would not charge a monthly fee for a deactivate modem be use for phone call only .
CableModem	POS	5	the modem be deliver exactly as promise , it arrive early , and it work great . my internet speed have more than double since switching from the modem I be rent from Charter .
