Dumbbell	POS	4	I have have my Shake Weight for man for 2 day now and so far I really like it . the 6 minute dvd workout really do make you muscle burn ! and my arm definitely swell up after ward just as if I would be lift weight . I can not say what the effectiveness will be in the long run but I do not see how this could not beef someone up . one thing I 'll say be that I do not really feel a workout in my chest . I may have feel a little soreness there today but not much . the workout dvd go over 3 workout and the Shake Weight come with a card show those workout plus one more that be not demonstrate in the video . my plan be to do all 4 every day . maybe I will notice it in my chest more ? I do have concern that this could hurt someone back if they have have previous back injury but it do not seem to be bother mine . overall it be a well make product and I think it be go to do a good job make my arm a little more cut . and honestly it be a lot more fun to use than plain old lifting weight . 4 Stars ! oh and I notice someone else 's review say just to buy the female shake weight ... I do not get that because the one for man be 5lbs and the female version be 2.5 lb ... 11\/14\/10 Update I still think this be a good product . if anything I keep slip up and stop use it for a week or two . but my arm be definitely more define . especially my triceps ! I have never be able to see any definition in that area but they be bulge out now when I flex . I be go to try to stay devoted to do the workout twice a day now and really accelerate the muscle growth . a quick bit of info . . at first it may seem that it be slim down you arm . what I have notice be that it burn any fat off first and then the muscle growth begin . do not be discourage . even use it off and on I be definitely more tone than I ever be . I be gonna push this thing to the max and see just how rip it can make I .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	Dumbell bar arrive bent on the edge , this make it impossible for the clip to secure the weight . the large bar be great , weight be well balanced . if I have to pick between the the weight set with dumbell and the set without dumbell . I would definitely buy the one without dumbell .
Dumbbell	POS	5	excelente producto esto va para mis amigo los venezolanos que siempre hay dudas de los paquetes persona serias y todo es como sale compre con seguridad soy muy delicado con mis compras y quede fino ciando vi lo paquete
Dumbbell	POS	4	weight be great . the bench that I get with they be a serious pain to build . the mechanism for the weight be also a little tight but will loosen with usage .
Dumbbell	POS	4	these dumbbell holder work well with the corresponding dumbbell . it look great and hold up well to the weight . safe and effective . a bit expensive for a stand , but effective .
Dumbbell	POS	5	so i get these in yesterday this morning be the first time use they and i love my new weight !! so easy to change the weight and they be not big and bulky . just make sure the the pin be in the right spot and not crooked . but overall im very glad i purchase these !
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a must buy if you own a set of Bowflex dumbbell . I do not quite understand the frustration everyone else be talk about with the assembly . yes , it be not the clearest set of instruction in the world , but it be really straight forward . if you look at a picture of the assemble stand , you should be able to figure it out without a problem .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very easy to use straight out of the box . I personally enjoy do this in front of the tv . it be a great way to change you current upper body work out routine and keep thing interesting . Make sure to watch the instructional video a few time to avoid arm injury .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very happy with these hand weight . the color of the weight I receive differ from the picture - I have pink , blue , and purple . nice grip and plastic stand be easy to put together .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love this thing ! when i first get it i couldnt even use it for a minute cause the burning of my arm ! now they be get into great shape and my boyfriend have even try it a few time lol I recommend to all the woman in my family and share mine when I can ! would get if you want to tone up you arm !!
Dumbbell	POS	5	the weight do not slip out of my hand during my workout , and they arrive quickly . there be no weird oily residue like I have find with other coated weight and they be coat so I do not have to worry about rust or metal scratch my floor .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have purchase the smaller set of these dumbbell that go up to 24 pound as a gift last year however the gift recipient need heavier weight so I buy this set . the reason to not give it a 5 star rating be : this set start at 10 pound and adjust to 45 pound and the lighter set end at 24 pound so I feel that this set should have start at a heavier weight . the only other reason it do not get the extra star be that the stand for these much be purchase separately and they be not inexpensive . otherwise , it be a great product overall . they do not take up much space . they be easy to use . I have coworker that be personal trainer that actually recommenede they when I be ask to make sure it be worth the money . I receive my order within a few day of order and do not pay extra for expedited shipping .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I admit it , my biggest reason for have concern about buy this stand , be the concern of put it together . not that I have trouble in general , put thing together , but because I have a lot of review , not just here , but on a few sport store website as well , that say the instruction be horrible and that this stand be very hard to put together . I be not for sure if they be now put new instruction in with this stand , or if people just do not pay attention when put something together . for anyone concerned about the stand 's assembly , here be what come in the package . 3 different size bolt , 1 size of flathead bolts\/screws , each with the nut attach and 4 stack of washer that work with any of the bolt . that be it . what I do , I open the blister pack of hardware and put each type of bolt together . that take about 1 minute , see that you can lay the 3 type of bolt beside each other and tell the difference in the longer one . once I do this , one step use the biggest bolt , all of they . one step use the medium size bolt , all of they and one step use the smallest bolt , all of they . it be that simple . even better , the instruction and order of assembly start with the biggest bolt , then medium , then smallest . there be no way to screw that up since the smaller bolt be not long enough to fit the step require the bigger one . the one thing I will note be though the allen key be include , be sure to have a pair of small vice-grip or 7\/16 socket\/adjustable wrench , to hold the nut in place while tighten the bolt . the only part I find to be the least bit hard be put the towel stand in . as we start work against gravity and not have enough hand , on this part . I have no idea there be a towel stand , it be the last step , and require hold a curved bar under the dumbbell holder , while insert 4 flat head bolt . still , after a few time of drop the bolt , you will get it right . the stand be not exactly like that one picture . the one picture have more of satin silver color to it , but this one have more of a matte gray color , darker color . not a big deal , as it really work nicely for what it be suppose to do . total time of assembly 45 minute , include remove everything from box . just follow those direction and you will not have a bit of problem . one last note , it do include strap to hold the dumbbell down , so if you buy the dumbbell too , do not worry about cut the shipping restraint , that look just like the strap in the picture I have see with the dumbbell on the stand . great product so far .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I be surprise to see this item have positive review . I be happy that it apparently do work for some people . however , in my opinion , it be just another gimmick . shake you way to more muscular arm use something so light ? yes , you might feel something -lrb- and be careful that it be not pain due to injury that you be feel ! -rrb- but you can do this type of exercise use just about anything of the same weight -lrb- whether it be a water bottle or a can of soup , etc -rrb- . I do try this product and , personally , I recommend good old fashion push-up instead . specifically tricep push-up if you be aim to work on toning\/defining that `` under the arm '' area -lrb- below you biceps -rrb- . you have three different muscle in you tricep area -lrb- thus , the name , as `` tri '' mean `` three '' -rrb- . it be not logical to use a light weight dumbbell and `` shake '' you way to definition\/strength of all these muscle . nose crusher and dip be a few other exercise that be great for the triceps . this area can be a problem area for both man and woman but from my experience , more woman seem to be bother by it . dip would be perfect for woman who do not want to develop a more `` bulky '' appearance as you use you own body weight against you while nose crusher would be best for man as you can use the weight of you choice and keep increase it as you progress . -lrb- please note : dip be a common exercise , as be Nose Crushers , but Nose Crushers MIGHT be know by a different name by you personal trainer -rrb- . of course , tricep push-up be very effective for both sex . one of my main reason for be unhappy with this product be the very high risk of injury that can be cause from do these exercise . not just the chance of pull a muscle , but it also increase you chance of head , neck and shoulder injury -lrb- which take forever to recover from -rrb- . tricep push-up , dip & nose crusher be excellent exercise for the tricep muscle that do not have a high risk of injury to any of these area -lrb- with the exception of nose crusher - if you do not have a spotter and do drop the barbell on you nose , well , like the name of the exercise state , you nose will be crush ! -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	4	in just the first day of use this shake weight , I could feel my muscle be stress . however , I have only have this for a week , so no result yet .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy these for my -lrb- grow -rrb- son for he birthday and he love they . I mention that a few review say the size of the dumbbell make some exercise awkward at the limit of the movement , but he say he have not notice any problem . very happy with the quality , convenience , and compact storage .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	this be one of those product that will collect dust ! I find it very difficult to use as direct and be concern that I could hurt myself with it !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be not sure what happen to the instruction for many peoiple below , but we rack arrive within 2 day -lrb- I love Amazon Prime -rrb- and I build it last night in less than 30 minute . instruction be idiot simple -lrb- which be good for I ! -rrb- very clear , and all item be neatly package and lable -lrb- right and leave -rrb- . I use a 9\/16 ratchet and the supply allen wrnech and have everything button up very quickly and easily . I have to be honest , i continue to be blow away by the quality and construction of Bowflex equipment . we now have a pay of dumbell , and a Selectech Bench and I have be amaze at how solid and good look everything be . I be a reasonably serious weekend warrior , and at 275 pound , I be not gentle on anything -lrb- treadmill , eliptical , bench -rrb- . I be certain the Bowflex item we have add in the past few month will last a lifetime .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	Got lax and do not realize it be for one barbell , make assumption I be get two base off price . even with Prime 's free shipping and a 20 % discount one barbell cost more than pick it up locally . never have a problem with any Cap equipment and will continue to purchase they .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I be not sure how well this product work but it certainly be entertaining . it be much larger than the Women 's Shake Weight but not much heavier .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a great set to use at home on the day that I do not go to the gym . ship be quick , item arrive 5 day prior to the estimate delivery date . the weight be make of great material . the stand be a little cheap but I do not buy this set for the stand .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love the size of it as i can store it just about anywhere and yet be able to lift weight anywhere from 6-24 pound . the only problem with it as other have mention be that you might mess up get the pin in straight to adjust the weight but it be easy to figure out when u have mess it up . another annoying thing about the dumbbell set be while ur work out the plate hit each other and u hear a annoying clunk sound
Dumbbell	POS	4	after start a new workout program that need a variety of weight and live in a apartment complex , I do not have much room . after review many product and talk with people , i choose the power block for the variety of weight , compact size of the weight and be able to quickly choose the size weight I need be great . but mostly to know when lift the weight over my head , they will not fall off , the durability be excellent . this be a great buy .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	this be not for people that be start to work out ... you need to be well build to be able to move it freely . and grip of it be bad ... I use it now and then but at time it can really mess up you finger .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	i baught this think ok one of my trouble spot as a woman be my arm , well ... its boring , its funky weight and shape to use , the instructor Lindsey creap I no insperation to keep use the video . . now the dog like the use it as a chew toy . i have have WAY BIGGER result with boxing glove and bag work and jump roaping with weight on my arm . i wouldnt recomend this except as a paper weight or chew toy ... plus my guy friend give I crap with there pervert mind its dumb
Dumbbell	NEG	1	this product appear to be well make . it be not flimsy and all the part work well together . but that be it for the good news . the handle be make of hard , slippery plastic that make it difficult to hang on to after even the slightest sweat . in addition , the handle be oddly shape , make it very uncomfortable to hold on to with one or two hand . I be not sure what they have in mind when they design the handle . as far as the benefit of use , I can not comment as the machine be just too uncomfortable to use long enough to give a review on this point .
Dumbbell	POS	5	after do a fair amount of research and read the review I choose this apex dumbbell rack for my home gym and be not disappoint . it be rock solid , functionally build , and fit in nicely . for some reason the instruction say to use 2 adjustable wrench , when all you really need be one socket wrench and it easily assemble in about 15 minute . that 15 minute though do not count the 30 minute it take I to go to Lowes to replace 3 miss screw and 2 washer . the box have a sizeable hole rip open in it upon arrival and on top of that most of the screw and nut and washer that be there be loose , so obviously some fall out in transit . I be surprise I be not miss more . consider that I only pay $ 89 on Amazon for it with free shipping , I can deal with the miss part . it be hard to believe that such a well make product can be so poorly package though , but if you can make it beyond that then this be a great dumbbell rack .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I workout every single day and need equipment that be comfortable to use . neoprene barbell work great for I . I be slowly work my way up through the weight and you can not find 6 pound weight in my area . for some reason , they go from 5 pound to 8 pound but I can not make that big of a jump without hurt myself . so glad I find the 6 pounder online !
Dumbbell	POS	5	i order two 4lb dumbbell . i use they 3x a week to do arm exercise . they work for I and i like the neoprene coating .
Dumbbell	POS	4	you will `` feel the burn '' if you use the Shake Weight accord to direction . it will harden up you arm , chest , and choulder with continue -lrb- and proper -rrb- use , but do not be fool by the commercial . they show these huge bodybuilder dude use it and act as though they have just complete a pentathlon . believe it or not , not everyone will see through this exaggeration . the Shake Weight will , as I say , harden you up with continuous PROPER use , but it will not take you from couch potato to bodybuilder as the commercial seem to suggest . it be a decent workout on you schedule . overall , I be happy with the product , but not happy with the commercial ; it be market a little too well ...
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I guess they serve the purpose , but do not be a fool get something of better quality . the bar come in two piece . . so retard ,
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order my powerblock weight because I need more option and fewer weight lie around . I love these weight . very easy to use . I have be use they in my workout several time a week and no problem encounter . my boyfriend even start use they ! I highly recommend this item .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have purchase the 3 lb a while back , and I finally feel ready to graduate to something heavier , so I get the 5 lb . as be the case with the older set , this be a good and useful product . they do not roll and be comfortable to hold .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be a `` young '' almost 62-year-old . while I be pretty fit , I have notice , and worried about , lose muscle mass . I see this on a `` health '' website I subscribe to . buy it for $ 30 at Walgreens . figure that for $ 30 it be a good risk . in two word : it work ! although I be not fanatical about it -lrb- use it every three day or so -rrb- it have make a noticeable difference . -lrb- Disclaimer : it will not turn a couch potato into Mr. America . -rrb- about two week after get it , my wife and I be at she family reunion on the beach in La Jolla , see family and cousin we see 2-3 time a year . I be curious if it would be notice without my say anything . it be notice ! everyone remark on how `` buff '' I look . Pretty good endorsement ! I think I might have help sell a few . key point : as the first part of the dvd point out , you must grip the shake weight tightly . if you hold it lightly , you can shake all night and it will not help . I wonder if people who say it do not work be grip it lightly ...
Dumbbell	POS	5	when this product first come out ... it be the laughing stock of the world . nobody take it seriously and the motion that you have to make to exercise with this weight make for great joke ! however , I recently read in the newspaper that this weight really do work . 2 trainer give they professional opinion -lrb- 1 male and 1 female -rrb- and they say the result you get be amazing . it work the muscle in a way that no other weight can . I decide to purchase it and cross my finger . I must say ... my husband and I reach for this weight at every bored moment we get . so easy to do during commercial while watch tv after the kid be in bed . a hour show have about 20 minute of commercial and use this weight for those 20 minute -lrb- stop while the show be on -rrb- really get you a great work out without overwhelming you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have have these weight for just over 2 week and they be nothing short of fantastic . very easy to switch from 5 to 45 pound to optimize a workout . I have already lose two inch off my waist thanks to these and a new diet . I would definitely recommend these
Dumbbell	POS	5	I make fun of this weight when it first come out because the workout look ridiculous , but then i research into the product , read many rave review -lrb- and many also claim it be a ridiculous look workout but that it work !! -rrb- and how this thing have work for they . I like work out but my busy shedule limit I from do hour of workout so with this 6 minute workout i can fit it right in before i go to sleep . I feel the burn and my muscle be sore the follow day . I will come back and review this again after a few month to tell of the outcome of this product and how it have work for I . but so far this product be do it be job .
Dumbbell	POS	4	my hubby ask for the Shake weight dumbbell , to add to he `` weight be '' collection ... it come as promise , on time and he love it . I try it for about 2 min and my arm be sore ! defiantly work . : o -rrb-
Dumbbell	NEG	1	when I receive the apex rack , it have obviously be use . everything be out of the packaging , and be rewrapped lazily and quickly . all of the bolt and washer be loose in the box , and some be suprisingly miss . the rack be scratch and dent , probably since it be use previously . I buy this as a new item , but it be not even close . very disappointing .
Dumbbell	POS	4	after read all of the review of this product , only a few of they match my experience . I receive the first weight rack and realize that one of the screw-hole be miss on the frame , make it impossible to properly assemble the rack . also , the box look quite beat up , and the part bag be open and sloppy ; not a good first impression , although all part be account for . we go through amazon and return it to we -lrb- very local -rrb- UPS store , and receive a new product in 2 day without any hassle , so as with all of my experience with amazon , it be quite pleasant . I have a relatively small apartment and the weight rack be right in the living room corner . I do not notice any overpowering chemical odor , and the rack itself be quite sturdy for my purpose -lrb- 50lb , 25 's , 20 's on bottom rack , 15 's , 10 's on middle , 8 's and 5 's on top -rrb- . it be very easy to assemble -lrb- one possible exception be the rubber foot , they be a bit tough to get on -rrb- and do not look bad either . I have have it for a month now , use it 5 day a week , and do not have any issue with this product . I would call it a good purchase for the money , and amazon make life easy . I give this product 4 star solely because the first one I receive be defective . if it be not defective , I would have easily give this 5 star .
Dumbbell	POS	5	after read several review for various dumbbell rack , I finally settle on this product . it be well build for a home gym , easy to put together , and look professional . Hex type weight be the best fit . once you move to smaller `` plastic or vinyl cover '' weight , they do not fit as well . overall , I be very pleased and feel the rack be well worth the money !
Dumbbell	NEG	1	poorly make in china with cheap plastic . Broke 5 minute into the first use . very disappoint . I like the idea of the shake bell . Wish to find another brand for this .
Dumbbell	POS	5	not sure why other reviewer have trouble with the assembly , but with basic tool it be no problem . product quality be good and the stand be attractive . make use the weight set alot more pleasurable , and worth the investment to save you back .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be use this product for about a week now and it do exactly what it say it do , you feel the burn on you arm and shoulder after each 6 minute workout . I have belong to gym in the past and they claim that what it take 42 minute in the gym you get in 6 minute with the Shake Weight be very accurate ! I see a lot of people panning this product on vary site , but for the price I figure I would give it a shot and it work like a charm ! all I can say be that people who say this do not work never actually try this ! definately recommend this as a good way to get definition in you arm !
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have be use this dumbbell set for several month now , along with some more standard dumbbell and a Bowflex weight bench . while I prefer the feel of standard dumbbell , this set be very compact to store and it be very easy to adjust the weight for specific exercize . I feel that they give I just as good a workout as any dumbbell I have use , even if they be a bit too bulky to use for wrist curl and other short range of motion exercize . for the standard bicep curl , bench press , overhead press and the like , I highly reccomend .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I buy these to add a little more challenge to my step aerobic . it be help to bring my heart rate up faster and help to tone my arm , which be exactly what I be look for . I like the neoprene coating since the weight do not get slippery even when I start sweating . my only complaint would be that the stand be a little flimsy . even so , I be happy with the value I get for my money . I may be buy another set because my husband have also start use they during we workout and we sometimes want the same weight .
Dumbbell	POS	5	after much research on adjustable dumbbell I end with the Powerblocks . I try several adjustable dumbbell at the store but nothing can come close to these . I be very pleased with these as they be very functional and quality make . adjust the weight be very fast and easy . they take up very little room compare to traditional dumbbell . if you want easy to use adjustable dumbell , quality make product , and save space than these be the Ultimate Dumbells for you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be look for a dumbbell rack that would fit in we bedroom and not be obtrusive . this item look good so I decide to use a $ 100 Amazon gift card to hold my set of dumbbell I have accumulate over time . the package come via UPS . it be well package . after open it and look at the instruction , it take about 15 minute to assemble with a socket wrench . it be simple to put together . I really like the size and color . it have a elegant finish , not the raw steel look you see in most gym . the most important thing for I be that it fit all of my dumbbell . after try this out and switch weight around for my optimal configuration , here be how I have the dumbbell place on each row . top row : -lrb- 4 -rrb- 5 lb , -lrb- 3 -rrb- 8 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 10 lb Middle Row : -lrb- 2 -rrb- 30 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 35 lb , 10 lb medicine ball Bottom Row : -lrb- 2 -rrb- 15 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 20 lb , -lrb- 2 -rrb- 25 lb note : I put my heavy dumbbell on the 2nd row so I do not have to bend over to much to pick they up . I be not able to fit my -lrb- 2 -rrb- 25 lb dumbell on the 2nd row with the 30 and 35 , so I put the medicine ball there . if you have more dumbbell than what I have describe , you may want to buy something bigger . I be really happy with this purchase . Hope this review help .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I purchase two of these weight and the color do not match between the weight . they look like two different shades of purple . it be not a big deal , but a little irritating . try the Body solid vinyl dumbbell instead .
Dumbbell	POS	5	Amazon be superb in deliver quality product such as this on from Bowflex . I order this for my husband and he love it !! recommend it to all who use exercise equipment .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be skeptical of whether or not the product would measure up to the hype , and I be pleasantly surprise . I see result after as little as a week . I have be use it for a little more than a month now , only do the basic six minute workout and the definition and muscle gain have exceed expectation . at first , the exercise be a little difficult but the more you do they , obviously the easier they get . for as much effort as you have to put into it , you get more than double the result . I know this be a little redundant but I be always concern about review and I want this one to really assure you . for the price , I would definitely buy it again , if I ever have to .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	it need to be a big bigger and have pad for the dumbbell but for the price I can not complain .
Dumbbell	POS	4	these work well for a quick workout when I can not make it to the fitness club . one of the box 's of the 25 lb dumbbell be almost break in half when I receive it but the weight appear undamaged . good quality , and I just end keep the wrapper around the handle because it feel like the grip be sandpapery without glove -- not that I ever use lift glove anyway , but the wrap make they feel comfortable .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	sorry but this be a great idea , however it should come in different weight size etc. . its very light weight . I really would have use it if it would have be heavier . HOWEVER for those just start out exercise and need to build up , its a great toy to burn some calorie . it shake with ease and there be alot of arm position you can use to start . they just need to make some adjustment for more muscle building . I guess you can use this to practice you grip control on a spouse , but hey I have a headache !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	everyone else have expound the benefit of this item with the one con be the instruction . certainly I scratch my head especially with the strap . -lrb- btw you have to unsnap the longer strap and loop the side without the snap through and then use the snap to secure it to the stand . -rrb- I would like to point out a few more con . 1 . the packaging and paint job from the manufacturer be terrible . Mine arrive with multiple paint ding and a destroy bowflex sticker . the bubble wrap provide only minimal protection give the shipping weight . the box easily tear by the UPS guy and I be surprised everything be still there when I open it . 2 . it also have multiple cosmetic paint abnormality such as bubble and run . the paint be also different shades than the bench and the weight . come on , how hard be it to paint the bench and stand the same color ! 3 . the stand tilt the weight forward make it harder to replace the handlebar on the stand if you have a weight that be sandwich between other . this happen because the weight lean . I have the 1090 set . 4 . it be too low and narrow . I be only 5 ' 7 '' and I have to bend down to get the weight . also because of how close they be it be more difficult to assume a correct posture . still it be a lot better than have they on the floor . in all I be expect more than I get but , be a physical therapist , I think you would be a fool to not have something to set these 90 # beast on .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I get this for one of my grandson 's for Christmas . he have be look at they at Walmart , he mother say . I like yours better than the Walmart one and I think it be a little cheaper . he seem to like it . it be heavy !! I think woman use these too for they arm . ship be fast and it be pack well . thanks .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	what a nightmare when I open the box ! the bolt , washer and nut be scatter all over the box . as expect , most of the piece be miss . I be also not able to find any square end Cap . the left and right beam be also scratch and the base of the beam be dent . I be not even sure if I be able to fit in the base end cap . these be just some of the few thing I have notice upon quick inspection . not sure what else be miss or wrong with the rack . I be return the item . what a waste of my time .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the shake weight can be use by people who have never go to gym or play professional or nonprofessional sport . the Weight do not weight that much so it make the rep hard to do . if you want to really add the pressure to a area then all it take be more effort instead of more actual weight . I would suggest the Shake Weight to other .
Dumbbell	POS	5	you see the commercial and I guess the actor be better at it than me , THEY LOOK LIKE IT 's MOTORIZED . oh well , it be not , BUT you still feel it work . take ALOT of EFFORT , BUT KEEP IT up and you 'll see result .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have have these for a while now , and for the most part , I like they . they be a reasonable compromise between individual weight dumbbell and other , more expensive , adjustable weight . it be easy to select the desire weight and with a maximum of 24 pound per dumbell , you can get a good amount of resistance for most common dumbbell exercise . the minor complaint I have be that they could have a bit more room between the rod that connect the weight disc , as my knuckle can sometime rub against they unless I hold it in just a certain way , and also it be not always easy to get the weight selector `` thingie '' in the right place . other than that , a far less expensive option than Bowflex .
Dumbbell	POS	5	excellent product for the money . since it be one piece nothing can loosen and fall off . they be coat with , I be guess , a epoxy . it have a smooth surface a will not rust . so they be no maintenance , and do what they be suppose to ; what more can you ask . a good value .
Dumbbell	POS	5	excellent product - i love to workout and now have some additional piece of workout gear . excellent quality and identical to those use by most gym i have be to .
Dumbbell	POS	5	great dumbbell set , make I use they a lot since its nicely set up with the stand and doesnt let I forget about it , since i keep it in front of my eye . great set . truly recommend .
Dumbbell	POS	4	Ok so I find mine at target , i be a woman and I buy the men one , I do not purchase to reduce arm flab I actually purchase to increase endurance\/stamina\/strength in the arm and shoulder as I be a Echocardiographer , basically what that mean be a ultrasound tech that scan the heart , and you guess it ... I have to scan under heavy obese breast ... to get to the heart and no the patient can not always hold they own up they might be unconscious , and anyone that be have one know that we have to push hard between rib pace for extended period to get image -lrb- while hold up those boob with the same arm -rrb- I be a new grad and boy be I in for a surprise at how weak I be !!!!!!!!!!! I can not endure more than 10 minute and not push hard means crappy picture which mean angry cardiologist and we have to do 10 a day for 30 minute each ... yike !! this be my answer . I get the men one because those boob usually weigh more than the female version and I be try to create endurance with that add weight like I say . I have do it two day now and my shoulder , biceps , triceps , pectoral , trap and lat all ache !!! whether or not the flab go anywhere this be definately a good workout for what I need .
Dumbbell	POS	5	just another success in a continuous stream of product order from Amazon , my preferred retailer . the time , traffic and deal with people require to go to the store ? forget about it . Amazon be my `` go to '' move for any retail purchase . price , speed and reliability be Amazon 's trademark quality .
Dumbbell	POS	4	my wife be very pleased with she shake weight . she use it every night , and feel more energize after a few minute of use , particularly after a tiring day 's work .
Dumbbell	POS	5	Ok , here be the truth as I have no agenda to either endorse or kill this product : I allow myself to get a bit out of shape and as I have finally turn the corner and make marked improvement in my diet and physique , I notice that my upper arm be flabby , and I allow they to become weak . I be skeptical of this product , but I decide to give it a try . when I do the first 6 minute workout , I manage to breeze through it , and I foolishly believe I be in better shape than I think . the next day however prove I wrong , as I find the repetition of the routine actually become harder . I also discover that I do indeed have a weak arm which could not match the other . I feel the burn and fatique after the 6 minute exercise program each time I do it . but then , by week three , I find myself do the 6 minute program 2 or 3 time a day , and though I be still not breeze through it as I do on day 1 , I be manage to complete the entire program . I also be do some add rep on my weak arm and I have manage to balance the two . now , after a month I be not go to say that I be suddenly rip , of course not , but I do notice something . at a moment when I be simply soap my upper arm , I discoverd that they be more `` solid '' and `` tight '' than they be a few short week prior . Let 's face it , you know you own body , so when you discover a change , without even consciously look for one , you become a bit startled . well , I be , and realize that there be some definite toning to my arm . I be also move the shake weight harder than I be thus increase my strength , and try new routine . so , have the product now for about two month , i continue my three 6 minute a day routine and be feel much better do it . I have find that it be a great motivator and one of the few weight regimen that be not boring . after all , if you can not spare at least 6 minute of you day do this program , then what do you want to do ? highly recommend ... ... .
Dumbbell	POS	4	unless you have a table or counter to put these weight on , it be just not good for you back . when re-racking weight and have to put it back on the floor . this rack be build for the dumbbell and function as it be . the wheel be very helpful when need to wheel these thing around . especially for cleaning . very stable .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I purchase the stand from another site - as a factory refurbish item . I be able to save about $ 40 that way , but alas , the stand come with no instruction . I be unable to get a response on obtain the instruction from Bowflex -lrb- in they defense , I grow impatient wait and I do not buy it from they -rrb- . I print a photo of the stand and have often use the zoom feature here on Amazon 's photo to figure out the assembly . it be pretty straight forward - but you do have to be careful which screw you put where . there be several that look the same , but be slightly different in length . in fact , the only problem I have with assembly - I have never use lock nut before and could not figure out how you get those dumb thing on ! but that be a malfunction on my part - not the stand ! I will say , aside from not know how to use a lock nut , I be relatively mechanically orient and find assembly of item very easy . I also enjoy assemble thing and find the assembly without instruction to be a nice brain exercise ! the stand itself be sturdy . it defintely help reduce strain on you lower back - worth the cost if you ask I . I also like the wheel on the bottom so I can move it out of the way from my child . I like the option standard foot though - I can see a time when I would like it to not be move around . but for now , we have to use the wheel . I also like the strap on the stand . I believe they be to keep the plate of the dumbbell in place so that they do not lift when you be lift heavier weight . BUT I have discover they be so simple to remove and re-attach , that I take they up over the dumbbell when not use the weight . this prevent little child from attempt to lift the weight . as I do not have the instruction , not sure if this be intend or recommend , but it work for we . I do not personally use the weight - they be for my husband -lrb- who be out of town for a while - thus why I assemble the stand -rrb- . so I can not comment on the stand during use .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have surgery on my shoulder , and my physical therapist recommend this for my home exercise . it be not mean to create a lot of weight to bulk up with -lrb- like it show in the advertisement -rrb- but it create enough resistance to build endurance and tone muscle , which be exactly what my deteriorated shoulder muscle need .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I like the convenience and effectiveness of this simple work-out . I can pick it up and use it anywhere and feel great . the best feature be that it have improve my posture like nothing else have - after four spinal injure and other back problem , I have work physical therapy and other machine and have strengthe my back , yet this be the best ever for improve posture . I usually use it longer that the 6 minute , although it be good to start out that length of time . thank you Shake Weight !
Dumbbell	POS	5	Powerblock Classic 5-45 set work great when you have the stand . I finish p90x with it , it be all I need in the weight dept. . I recommend get the stand . it be a bit cumbersome to change weight setting if you sit these weight on the carpet , whereas on a hard surface , it be a simple and quick change . with the routine I have be do , you need to quickly change the weight sometimes , and with the stand , the weight be at a comfortable height , just perfect . without the stand , change weight setting be a chore .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I receive this stand free with my dumbell . the stand be well build and be a usefull addition to my work out room . the stand be easy to assemble . so easy that my 14 year old child assemble it with out my help in less time than it take for I to take a shower . the only thing I would like to see different on this stand be I would like it to be about 10 inch taller . I be over 6 foot and the stand while still very usable be a bit on the short side . it should be the perfect size if you be in the 5 foot range . still be a bit shour it be much better than store the weight on the floor . the wheel make it nice to move it around when I want to vacuum or just have it out of the way .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a great product . I do not receive the cd with the dumbbell , but be sure it would help to have that . however , I have be use it and have wonderful result . L.
Dumbbell	POS	5	if you have the SelectTech dumbbell I highly recommend obtain the stand . my main reason be to eliminate possible lower back injury : this stand place the weight at the perfect height -lrb- I be 6 ' 0 '' -rrb- . finally , do not listen to any of the other review concern the assembly process ; if you read the instruction and lay out the component assembly should only take about half a hour .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	I find the weight hard to use , the shake motion do not go as smooth as it appear when you see it on tv .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have get the shake weight for man and I absolutely love it . I use it every day and I actually feel sore after use if for about 10 minute . I can see some definition start to come in my arm that I have never see before . obviously it look a little strange but if you have not try it already then I recommend you do !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I finally get permission from my wife to purchase this stand . I enjoy the fact that it have wheel and I can set the stand in front of the tv as I work out , and then effortlessly wheel it out of sight afterwards . it save my back , as I no longer need to pick up the dumbbell off the floor . I think the direction for put it together be adequate .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order product on mon get it on thu ! awesome ! some review state the direction be difficult I however be a picture person I be able to put it together in about 40min or so juggle attention to kid and back to assembly ... over all happy
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order this and its great and can be use in so many way . ithought it be battery operate but nope . so dont have to worry about run to the store time after for battery , i recommend this if you be tryng to build up they biceps !
Dumbbell	NEG	2	IM NOT A WEAK PERSON BUT I just feel like this be hard to use and CONTROL . while I be do it it be bounce around all over the place I have to DO VERY SMALL MOVEMENTS or IT FEEL LIKE ITS just all over the place and my husband be like your not do it right ! BUT if I do it the other way it sway front and back I mean you CAN FEEL your muscle work BUT THIS PRODUCT be just not for me
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be a excellent rack for a home gym . it be not as big as some other , but for a home gym with 8-10 set of dumbell it be perfect . the weight be easy to get to and the frame be very stable .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love my shake weight ! honestly one of the best -lrb- and quickest -rrb- upper body workout I have ever use ! I buy mine about a month ago . slack in the beginning , but I have be use it faithfully -lrb- once a day -rrb- for the last two week , and I have already see a difference ! I be a little upset that I do not do it everyday since I first buy it ! if you think about get one , definitely do ! it be worth it ! -lrb- head up : the dvd say six minute , but it be really ten ! -rrb- so what be ten minute a day ?! = -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	4	I purchase this set for use with Chalean Extreme and they work great . good quality product . it be easy and quick to change weight and I have have no problem with they after 5 month of use 3 time per week . couple of thing to note . they do need to be store on a hard service ; place on carpet make it very difficult to change the weight set . only thing I would change would be the grib when hold a single weight overhead with both hand . it be hard to place both hand on or inside the weight and get a comfortable hold . otherwise , for the quality and money spend , this set can not be beat !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy the Shake Weight a week ago and already I be notice result ! I have more definition in my biceps . the 6 minute work out be really quick but I feel like I be get a way better arm workout than I would at the gym . I will continue to use this product !
Dumbbell	POS	5	upon weigh the accessibility of the gym near I against the cost of membership , I decide to try figure out what step I can do at home to aid in get start with fitness . I look up some exercise online for dumbbell , and then search Amazon for some starter kit . I be weak . I admit it . so this seem to be the perfect beginner set . the free shipping alone make this a sweet deal . the weight arrive extremely quick and before the original expected date . the stand be a bit flimsy , but it be small enough to be push into a corner and seem to hold the weight with no trouble . the weight themselves be comfortable and the perfect size for I . I think this be a great tool for any beginner to get start with .
Dumbbell	POS	5	my husband buy these for I , and they be great . I mean , what else do you expect from 5-lb dumbbell ? they work for I !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I order the entire set for my Husband for he birthday . the bench , dumbbell and this stand . be like he die and go to GYM HEAVEN . he love each piece . the stand be great to hold the dumbbell , which u really need .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	just toss this piece of c -- p in the garbage !!!! what a waste !!!! spend the extra money on a better brand .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I orginially buy this for my son who keep say how much he want it . . he love and as do i. . I use it just as much as he do . thank you !
Dumbbell	NEG	2	this be 1 hand weight , not a set of 2 hand weight . this be include in the product information , but I have get into a bad habit of read review and not the product info . I be give it a low rating , because it seem intentionally mislead to offer only 1 weight instead of a set . of course , after receive the product , I order another to complete the set -lrb- which be probably the seller 's goal , but it would be a hassle for I to return instead -rrb- . I would not have choose this product for the price if I have realize it be not a set . however , if you only need one weight , this one seem like a nice quality .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the shake wieght will definately work you , and wear you out !!! it be a great deal !!! I use it regularly , and you can actually feel the result , you 'll tigthten up quickly use it , you 'll love it . its a excellent way to stay in shape !
Dumbbell	POS	4	after use it for a week , I have notice a definite improvement in my muscle development . it take a lot of energy to shake this item . well , my muscle be sore . for mature individual who be wheelchair bind like I , I recommend this as a additional aid for exercise . I find the shaker very useful and the total price with free shipping the best reason to get it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have have these Powerblocks for five year . I use they just about everyday . combine with a good quality bench there be not much you can not do with these . they be a staple in any exercise equipment arsenal . they save a tremendous amount of space and clutter compare to individual dumbbell . they be very reliable , but you do need to move the retain pin with care and not in haste , as if you get it engage across multiple section it could be a dangerous situation when you lift they up -lrb- this have happen to I a few time but be really not a huge issue -rrb- . once engage with the desire weight , they stay together nicely and they feel solid and do not rattle . I like to do tricep extension while standing , and in the gym I can pick up a single traditional dumbbell and hold it by its end with both hand and lower it behind my head and then do the extension . that be the only exercise that be somewhat difficult to do with the Powerblocks , due to the limited space to grasp the weight end of the Powerblock . but that be a minor nit . they be indestructible , and with the exception of a few scratch on the side , look and operate like the day that I buy they . as state earlier , I use these almost daily , so they have serve I very well . in my new house , we have a actual gym with rubber floor and lot of space but I see no reason to not continue to use these powerblock due to they compactness and ease of use . I find the soft grip to very comfortable and I also like the way they feel in my hand and the way they provide lateral support since the Powerblock slightly rest on you wrist area when lift they . slight downside be that I have max they out , as most probably will if you strength train regularly , so I find myself want more weight . highly recommend this product .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I have purchase both the shake weight for woman , and version for man . . they do the same thing , and do give you the work out that will `` over time '' give you definition and size . . I dont think the market need a Mens version , and to charge $ 20 more for it be label for man do not convince I either . I purchase to see if it be in fact a drastic improvement verse the original , and I didnt notice any such variable that would make I recommend it over the ORIGINAL Shake weight that be market towards woman . I mean before the male version come out , Charles Barkley a TNT guy be co-sign the female version during the NBA season . . Nuff Said ! lol !
Dumbbell	NEG	1	go to use for the first time and it fall apart . try to fix but do not work the same . very poorly make or get a faulty one . would not recommend to anyone .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have see great improvement in my arm from this shake weight . arm be no longer flabby . it be easy to use , I always exercise to the include dvd , only 6 minute . this work much better than equipment at the gym and traditional weight .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I receive the Shake Weight for a Easter gift . I have be work with it every morning for about a week - be careful with the single arm exercise , as some other customer have warn to do , and I can see a difference in my arm already . the 6-minute work-out do produce a fairly deep burn feeling in my arm muscle , but I have notice that I recover much better while I be take collagen :  Bovine Collagen , 120 capsule  most of the complaint I have read about the Shake Weight would probably be eradicate if a user view the video instruction , which come with the Shake Weight , before attempt to use the weight . it require practice but the Weight do work - if you do .
Dumbbell	POS	5	want dumbbell for home use , but not a separate pair for every 5-pound increment -lrb- would require more space , have to build a rack for they , out of place in multi-purpose room , etc. -rrb- . the PowerBlocks give I 5 to 45 lb . per dumbbell , change easily in seconds , have even weight distribution with padding around wrist , stay securely attach , and be easily store when not in use . no complaint .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	if you be like I and want to buy this dumbbell because of its great commercial , please be aware that it be total waste . I buy it not for shake weight but for my every day exercise . absolutely no result and you feel like a retard every time shake it and hope it would do something . although it be hard to shake in the beginning , it do not do anything to the body that you see in commercial .
