HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I give the Panasonic Home Theater Audio System model sc-htb15 5 star . I have it hook up to a flat screen , blue ray , and game system . when turn on the sound come through and when off the sound come through the tv like normal , no button to push . I use the optical digital audio in terminal from the tv to the theater system . I then use a hdmus from blue ray and PS3 to system , hdmus out to tv . hook it up be very easy . speaker can be vertical or horizontal , hook together or separate , on wall or stand or foot , you choice . Subwoofer sit to either side . remote be basic on\/off , tv\/hdmi input selector , subwoofer + \/ - , volume + \/ - and mute . I must note my Samsung control also work with the theater system , which allow I one control use for less clutter . there be control on the sub woofer also . it have a nice clear sound and get louder then I will ever need . there be sound now hear in video game I never know be there , like you enemy in the grass , or glass shatter in the distance , it be fantastic . Blue ray movie be better then the theater . I would recommend to anyone want a simple , easy to use system for full sound without tweaking . you have multus channel mode , auto mode -lrb- direct mode -rrb- and 2-channel mode .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I have own this system since June 2004 . ok for a basic system , but you can do better , even with home-theater-in-a-box . in many way , I prefer my old 1997 Pioneer 5x100w receiver & 1999 Pioneer dvd player . pro 's - very stylish look - great sound clarity for this level system - appreciate the color-code speaker connection CON 's - it be reasonably loud , but i just do not feel the raw power . my friend have a $ 2000 Denon system that have the same clarity , but shake you to the bone ! more comparably , i have a 1997 Pioneer system w \/ 100w per channel -lrb- same as dav-fc8 -rrb- , but feel more powerful , albeit way less refine . - occasionally , dvd will start-up with no sound . a power-off\/power-on sequence usually fix this - surround sound seem weak - my LR surround speaker have become very staticy . sony do not sell a replacement part , so they want $ 130 to repair . - disc take a long time to change\/load . make this worse , the dvd player do not resume a disc from where you leave off after turn the system off\/on . - you can not save separate sound field 's for each function -lrb- video-in , Tuner , dvd , etc. -rrb- - the front speaker be easily topple by a small child -lrb- my 9-month old nephew , in this case -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	a lot of punch in a small package . great sound , pretty easy setup , although I do not like the speaker connection too much .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I purchase this unit and have be very surprise at the sound quality it provide . if you set this unit up for the room it perform like a much more expensive unit . the bass be good , rear support be good , and the volume of the center front channel be also adjustable .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	great product , compact design , very good functionality , easy to set up . I love it . could use a better look design , but it be ok .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	it be be couple of day i have this product , i have both goods and bad to share .  Goods : 1 -rrb- excellent sound quality 2 -rrb- very stylish 3 -rrb- ability to play all kind dvd 's , mp3 disc , VCD 's and of course regular cd 4 -rrb- sound be good enough for any bedroom or office room , but not for a big size living room 5 -rrb- have a pretty good AM\/FM tuner  bad : 1 -rrb- what the heck a fan be do behind the reciever , I have play with so many music system but none have a fan -lrb- probably mean for cooling . -rrb- 2 -rrb- you can not use random feature with mp3 disc , i guess this be a very desirable feature . 3 -rrb- Wish there be a clock\/alarm feature 4 -rrb- Speaker wire be not lengthy enough for a decent size bedroom
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	do not buy ANY Panasonic Products . my Home Theatre that I buy be the sc-ht830v . I pay nearly $ 400 for it . exactly 1 year & 2 week after buy it , the display quit work , and no sound come out of the speaker . one year after spend $ 400 , its worth nothing . and , of course , they customer support be nicely say ... `` I be sorry , sir , but since it be out of warranty , company policy say we can not do anything . '' so , despite spend $ 400 -lrb- which be a lot to I -rrb- , they would not do a thing because I the system break 2 week too late . therefore , they lose a customer ... for life . and I urge you to stay away from they .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	wonderful crystal clear sound , get all the feature I want : VCD , CD , mp3 , progressive scan , DTS , pro Logic , 5-cd changer ... only complain be the disk changer be sort of slow , but hey , as long as I dont have to get off the couch . : -rrb- my 1st buy be a Panasonic sc-ht75 from circuitcity . it be nice , but the quiet rear speaker be really disappointing . now that Amazon be sell sc-ht95 at amost the same price I pay for the sc-ht75 -lrb- after the rebate for 95 and tax for the 75 -rrb- , I make the switch immediately . with 75 , I have to turn up the rear speaker to max and turn down the front speaker to feel a hint of ` surround ' sound . for 95 , even at a low volumn I can vividly hear bullet fly pass by my ear ! Hav not get a chance to test the progressive scan yet , which be a major feature the sc-th75 lack . all in all , excellent machine and powerful speaker at a great price , highly recommand it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be the perfect system it stand up with bose if not better . clear sound no distortion . high , mid , and low ; JBL have it cover with this system and include everything you need for setup include Wall hang mount .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	consider the bargain we get this for , I be very happy with the result . it be easy to get home , very easy to set up . the include mount material be all we need to keep everything look good around the living room . my only major complaint so far be that the video and audio seem a little out of sync on some channel that I never notice before we hook up this unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	back in 2000 , I purchase this system to be my all-in-one home theater . while $ 700 can now get you much , much more , this be a great system for I . speaker be not overly powerful , but they be extremely easy to set up and run , good sound quality , and stylish . I have have it for almost 6 year and only complaint be a crappy dvd lense -lrb- reader -rrb- . some disk be stubborn , but still play . I typically troubleshoot by re-loading dvd until it would read . then , I get smart and purchase a scotch dvd cleaner from BestBuy , which greatly help . lastly , when Progressive scan dvd player come down in price , I just buy one for cheap to get higher picture quality and run sound through Panasonic -lrb- use as traditional receiver\/speaker setup , not all-in one -rrb- . I have finally outgrow this set , but I do plan on run it in my bedroom as I replace with a higher-end , more digitally enable system . speaker be too weak for big family room , and no digital audio in\/out or upconversion ability .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy this system a couple of month ago because I want a setup to replace my CD player , dvd player , Radio Tuner and sound receiver . I also want to go digital and have more power . this be the best system ever , and the best upgrading decision I have ever make ! sure , it be work to set it up , but you can go to any store -lrb- best buy , Circuit City ... -rrb- and ask for help . as far as hookup go I actually think it be relatively simple as long as you get a digital cable -lrb- which you would be crazy not to -rrb- . connect coaxial out on the player to coaxial in on the receiver and you be rockin . all you have to do then be hook up the speaker and sub-woofer . from there you can just set it up how you want it . besides , I recommend read the manual thoroughly for any electronic device . especially with this one -lrb- both dvd and receiver -rrb- because there be so many cool little feature that you would never figure out on you own . the sound with this be incredible . music be great -lrb- especially with sub-woofer -lrb- isolate bass from treble , imagine if bass guitar and lead guitar be play through the same amplifier , that be not right , they be two separate instrument on two separate channel , as present here so you get more accurate reproduction -rrb- , and movie in digital mode be almost better than the theater -lrb- movie like Star Wars , Lord of the ring , and 007 truly rumble -rrb- . the remote for both be very comprehensive , well lay out , and usable -lrb- in fact they be almost interchangable -rrb- . if you be look for a great , powerful home theater system with great feature and truly accurate sound reproduction , look no further than Sony and especially this model . you 'll be blow away !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	the set up be really easy for this . . but for some reason I can not get all the speaker to work . the color code wire make it idiot proof . . but the mid range speaker will not work .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this receiver be excellent . the ipod iPhone charge station be cool . need to have you own speaker for upgrade . I sell the speaker that come with unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I can not accurately express how great this product be in a few paragraph , but I 'll try . I 'll start by say that I already have a blu-ray player -lrb- PS3 -rrb- , so I be look for a surround system that be affordable and easy to set-up , actually sound good , and feel like a quality product . after use the system for a few day I can tell you that it have more than accomplish these thing . I pay full retail price , which be $ 350 , but again , I only need a surround system by itself , no dvd or blu-ray player , which be what the majority of system seem to be these day with bd become more popular . that say I be willing to pay a little more if it be a good system . the system come with a central speaker , two front speaker and two surround speaker to achieve 5.1 surround , which be plenty for a apartment like mine . there be also a very powerful subwoofer include as well , so when I have a home I can really pump the bass . additionally , the power be 1000w . know a bit , but not a whole lot about surround sound setup , this system make it ridiculously easy for I to set it up and get go . each speaker be color-code for easy installation , which seem like a no-brainer but this be not always the case . so anyway , you plug the wire into each speaker and then into the receiver and plug in the subwoofer and you be do with the wiring , it be really that simple . the wire be plenty long for the two surround speaker as well , so that be not a issue . there be also a auto-calibration microphone that come with the system that you place where you sit when you watch tv and it do its thing in less than 30 seconds and you be system be calibrate positionally just like that . I have watch a few blu-ray so far and the sound really be great , top-notch really . if you have never have a surround system before , you do not know what you be miss ! I could never watch a movie again without it . its a very powerful system as well , I be wait for my neighbor to say something soon lol -lrb- which be why there be night mode include -rrb- there be many mode you can use as well , such as Dolby pro Logic with 5.1 support , sport , game , music etc. . . Sports give you a reverberate sound as if you be at the stadium listen to the announcer , pretty cool minor stuff . now , there be also 3 hdmus input include , which be partly why this system be a little pricier than other , but it be well worth it . so I have my PS3 and DVR hook into the receiver with one to spare . it be nice to just switch the receiver to which one I want rather than the tv , I basically do not need my tv remote anymore . I know there be no ipod dock include , but you can buy a $ 8 cable -lrb- red and white tip -rrb- and play it through that , so it be not really worth the $ 100 + Sony dmp dealy . so there you have it , a great system for the price from Sony , who come through in the clutch once again . ignore the review that say they think this have a blu-ray player with it , I be not review Amazon , rather I be review this product . pro : 3 hdmus input , great sound , sleek and compact , easy set-up , auto-calibration . con : a tad pricy but the quality be there if you do not need a blu-ray player and you do not want to deal with annoyingly complicate set-up , this be the system you want .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I be a real Panasonic fan and usually love they product , but if I have my choice again I would buy something else . I be not angry I buy this , but I be sure there be better out there .  I be not a real audiophile , so I do not feel qualify to rate the sound on this system . Suffice to say I have be very happy with that aspect .  the feature , however , leave a lot to be desire .  First , pretend that this be a single-disc player . you can not change a disc while do anything else . you can not change a disc while play another disc , while listen to the radio , you vcr or auxilliary channel . add to that the fact that change from one disc to another take around ten seconds -lrb- easily twice the time I be use to for change disc -rrb- . it also stop after each disc - you can not set it to play all disc through .  second , this be the only cd-player I have see in year that skip regularly . on disc that play fine on all my other cd player , this one skip , stutter and sometimes stop entirely . it seem about as good as the first generation of cd player , back in the late 80 's . I intend to call customer support about this - hopefully this be not normal for this system .  Third , the control be confuse and difficult to use . I be a technical person who usually dive into all the setting on everything , but the control for the various surround mode seem ill-thought-out and generally difficult to commit to memory .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have two of these . one be a model that be no longer availible and the other be the current model . I boughtthe first to replace a sony rack system that i have for about ten year . I would still be usee it if lighting have not burn it beyond repair . I try many through a rental company and find that thy do not meet the quality that i have become acustome to . when I find this system , it once again make I ask the question , be that dog bark outside or on the tv ? the only thing that i have a complant about be that I have a dvd and sit PVR and both have digital audio out . the older version only have the one in with the choice of either optical or coaxial . this one have they seperate between video 2 and video 3 . I love it now . I still use they both .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	subwoofer and satellite speaker never work . three call to Vizio support be no help . with all the time I have waste try to get this to work , I could have buy a full price bose system . sorry , have to run and repackage everything to send it back .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the head unit be a bit slow - could use more process power . and my PS3 be a better bluray player at the end of day .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I be very disappoint with this speaker system . the lousy speaker on my tv sound much better . I have to turn it off at first , but then experiment a little more . it sound half way decent if you be only listen to music . Kind of like a old garage sale radio . it sound terrible for tv and movie though , which be what I buy it for . the sound be very flat , and even though I turn the rear speaker up all the way , they be barely audible . I would not really suggest this system for anyone , even those on a limited budget like I . you can find a system that sound better in most garbage dumpster .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	we have own Onkyo component for over 15 year now . when we decide to upgrade we exist Onkyo receiver to take advantage of the new technology for home theater , we know we want to stay with the Onkyo brand . after check models\/prices locally , we look online and come across this system on -lrb- ... -rrb- and decide to go with it . the system ship and arrive as advertised but after set it up we start have problem with it within week . we run all of we audio\/video component through the receiver then out to TV & speaker . we first problem be that when watch dvd the picture would blank out for a few seconds periodically and be not isolate to just one damage disk . the sound would continue on through these black out without interruption . for troubleshoot I bypass the Onkyo receiver with the video output from the dvd player directly into the tv . the video black out stop . when I contact -lrb- ... -rrb- about the problem , I be tell that I have to deal directly with the retailer that ship it , not Amazon . I contact the retailer and be tell that we need to contact Onkyo for repair\/assistance . since we have a viable workaround to this issue we decide to skip the hassel of disconnecting\/boxing\/shipping the unit back and be without a stereo for 6 - 8 week or more . well , about 8 month later the same thing start to happen when we be play tape in we VCR . again , I bypass the receiver directly to the tv and the problem stop . we do have other `` issue '' with the Home Theater in a Box system , such as the speaker not be very good quality , the subwoofer box rattle and we find a loose piece of wood in it . we never have a problem with we previous Onkyo component . we have subsequently purchase a new Onkyo receiver from a local retailer and have not have any problem with it at all . obviously we still like Onkyo brand and do not know if we problem be relate to purchase a `` refurbish '' system or not but it be hard not to draw that conclusion .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	despues de buscar un buen sistema de teatro en casa , que no I costara una fortuna y trajera todo lo necesario , este sistema de rca fue el mas indicado en el papel y despues de tenerlo por 6 mese puedo decir que es mas que indicado ya funcionando , tanto para peliculas como para musica . Al principio tuve un poco de temor por la marca -lrb- RCA , no e fuerte en hi-fi , no ? -rrb- , pero la calidad es muy buena , no ha fallado nus un momento desde que lo instale y ademas trae todo lo necesario para conectar los equipos . El receptor tiene mas que suficiente potencia y tienen un nivel de distorsion muy bajo por lo que es muy bueno para musica . El decodificador DTS e muy bueno , definitivamente suena mejor que el Dolby 5.1 y este receptor lo maneja muy bien -lrb- si que se sentira en el cine -rrb- . otro punto importante es la cantidad de entradas que tiene , digitale opticas y coaxiale , RCA de audio y video y de s-v ideo , y que la asignacion de cada una a lo equipos que le conecta es muy facil . como otro han mencionado , el subwoofer podria ser mejor , se siente un poco corto de aire a altos niveles de volumen , pero este se puede cambiar por otro pasivo -lrb- el receptor tiene el amplificador de 200 watt , por lo que un subwoofer mejor lo aprovecharia -rrb- o ponerle otro amplificado , pue tiene una salida extra . Los parlante frontale no son del todo buenos tampoco , pue siento que colorean mucho las frecuencias altas . por ello los cambie por mis Panasonic que tenia de mi equipo anterior y el equipo suena mejor -lrb- estos parlantes son mas grande -rrb- . Debo dejar claro , sin embargo , que el equipo suena muy bien con lo parlante originale . La unica queja real que tengo con este sistema es por el control remoto , no tiene codigos para dvd 's y no maneja bien lo aparato a lo que si se les asigna codigo . Practicamente lo uso solo para el receptor . Definitivamente recomiendo el sistema para quien quiera gozar de la musica o de lo soundtrack de pelicula .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	Panasonic pack a lot of value and versatility into its SC-HT400K Home Theater System . the quality and feature of this system make it worth every penny of the manufacturer 's suggest retail price and a genuine bargain at the discounted price find at retailer .  setup be reasonably straightforward , although the spacing of speaker terminal be tight even for small finger . a built-in white noise generator make balance the output of the speaker a snap .  most of the half dozen sound field that can be impose on the output -- range from a intimate club venue to a stadium - while more pleasingly understate than other I have hear , will , I suspect , find little use by most listener . one of those field , however , be very effective and clever . the `` party '' mode allow the listener to walk about the room without perceive the source of sound to shift from speaker to speaker .  the sound from the speaker be unforced and transparent-at least at level that the dog and the neighbor will tolerate . the rear speaker do not make themselves obvious as a source of sound -lrb- except when the source material deliberately place the sound at those speaker -rrb- . the general effect of the rear speaker be subtly to pull sound from the plane of the front speaker into three dimension .  last year the leading consumer magazine rate Panasonic 's stand alone receiver , sa-he100k , a best buy . a comparison of the sc-ht400k 's receiver with the sa-he100k receiver do on Panasonic 's website show the two receiver to be substantially the same , with the sc-ht400k lack a few feature that its brother have . -lrb- for example , the sa-he100k be a 6.1 channel receiver ; it have a output for a rear center speaker . -rrb- if the price difference between the sa-he100k plus a set of speaker and the sc-ht400k package narrow enough , the purchaser might want to consider buy the former separate rather than the latter system .  after the foregoing kudos , why give the sc-ht400k a rating of only four star ? the subwoofer that I get with this system be defective . fortunately , there be a authorized Panasonic repair shop within ten mile of my house and the defective part be replace in a week at no charge under the manufacturer 's warranty . nevertheless , the defect be a inconvenience and should not have get past quality control .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	just hooked this up to my Hitachi 60 '' LCD\/Projection TV and be very pleased . you may read review from `` bass-head '' who be only interested in ridiculous thumping , not purity of sound , but I can tell you this system sound fantastic . my family room be 20 x 15 and these speaker fill the room with a rich , vibrant sound rival that of a bose system -lrb- cost twice as much -rrb- that I try and return .  the subwoofer be perfect for the system - it add rich base without sound like one of those `` install by a teenager '' car system you hear so much of today , and it do not take up the entire floor to do it . we could not reach full volume before the system be too loud for comfort . 12db on the dial be enough to drown out any attempt at normal conversation . the surround sound be phenomenal -lrb- Matrix Reloaded play Progressive scan Component out be we baseline movie -rrb- .  the manual be a bit tedious . I be pretty technically inclined , and this be a bit of a challenge for I . the fact that the remote have a shift-key say a lot . plan to spend some time master this thing .  bottom line : if you be look for a chest-cavity shake , hip hop dance club thumping system , buy discreet component . if you be look for a attractive , affordable , incredibly clean sound system with very high quality component , this be definitely the system for you . easily 5 star for this price .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	well , when I unpack the box of this rather inexpensive home theater and take the fifteen or so minute to hook it up , I have less than fantastic expectation .  I be thrill to hear the quality of the sound when I finally sit down to watch a movie with the new system , but disturb when I find out that the loud , booming theater-like audio salvo that be assault my apartment be the product of volume level one . the scale go to over thirty , I believe -lrb- and I can only imagine who would take it up that high -rrb- , but , as you would suspect , there be nothing below one that produce any sound at all .  I could not watch the movie that night ... or any night for that matter . if I have , I be sure the neighbor would have be beat down the door . it be far too loud for any but the most diehard of loud-theater-like sound fan . the manual and other review say adjust the `` Dynamic '' set within one of the menu help resolve this , but it do not seem to do much at all with the unit I purchase .  the next day , I pack everything back into its box and return it to the retailer . I later purchase a similarly price Venturer model ... it be scale go to 100 , and one be nearly inaudible . much more control ... nearly the same sound quality .  I would stay away from this model unless the room it will be install in be of massive proportion and you enjoy wipe blood from you ear .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	we buy this home theater system for Christmas and have be nothing but impressed . the sound quality be absolutly wonderful . I highly recommend it if you like thing loud . plus I do not think that we would use the 5 disk dvd player , but now I find it useful and glad that we go with the 5 disk dvd player .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	this be a nice little home theater system and it serve the purpose for which it be intend . it be small , easy to put together , have detail instruction and produce a nice quality sound for watchinig movie without be too overwhelming . this be definitely for home use , so anyone who be look for a booming , thunderous effect in a larger area will not get it from this unit . I be unable to hook it up to my 20 year + stereo system , but that be no surprise . I also could not get that itsy bitsy remote to work . but these be not deal breaker and overall , it do quite well in my family room .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I have have this system for almost a year now . every thing on it work great . there be a few exception like hold the ff and rw to actually rewind and fast forward . also , to those look for true wireless please think . do you want you speaker to be run on battery ? it have to have a terminal to connect to the back speaker . I be have to send the system in because the fan be bust due to a power surge . a minnor hasle , over all it produce great sound and great picture quality . Great for beginner and expert user for a affordable price
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I have have a Sony dav-fc7 for about 1 1\/2 year . I know when I buy it that there be a few bad review , but like anything , it be expect that not everyone will be happy with it and there will be a bad experience here or there . plus it be not a top of the line device anyway . however , the odds of have a bad experience with this unit be unrealistically high as note by the other 28 review post just on Amazon . I primarily use mine for the home theater aspect . it be only have a couple dozen dvd 's play probably . recently while try to watch a dvd , it lock up 3-4 time just like a computer lock 's up - but computer lock up be generally due to configuration or software issue , not hardware . I have to cycle the power each time to get anything to respond , then find my place again in the movie . now just two day ago , I notice that it have the ` standby ' message flash continuously , the same as many other have note . I can unplug it to ` reset ' it , however , now I can hear audio , but have no picture come though it . the dvd part do not work at all , I think there be a stuck dvd in it . the ` reset ' appear to have only short term effect as well . I have to unplug it each time I turn it off - otherwise the ` standby ' message take over . of my last 3 Sony purchase -lrb- vcr , dvd , camera -rrb- , 2 of the 3 have be flaw . shortly after I purchase a Sony vcr , the front panel display go out . everything else seem to work okay -- you just can not tell by look at it what it be do or even if it be on\/off . nice craftsmanship\/design - Sony . I be hope my camera fair better over the long term - which should be consider longer than a few month or 1 1\/2 . I can guarantee , Sony will not get any more of my dollar for a long time .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I search , research and review every thing I could find about home theater system for about 3 week before choose the Panasonic sc-ht400 . I select it for 3 reason ; value , performance and brand reputation . and my homework pay off . this system be easy to set up ; only take I 25 minute to set up the 400 and a Panasonic progressive scan dvd \/ hi-fi VHS combo unit . it also have lot of little extra and a clear instruction manual . but more important than any of that ; it sound incredible ! deep clear bass from the subwoofer , crisp and clear sound from the satellite and excellent preset and adjustment option . I find the sound quality to be on par with Pioneer 's receiver and jbl speaker . and this unit be just as amazing when play dvd 's as it be when listen to music . I whole heartedly recommend this system , especial in conjuction with the Panasonic pv-d4743 . this be the best home theater system I find ...
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	just unboxed the MartinLogan MLT-2 Home Theatre , and I be so far blow away by the quality and construction of the entire unit . when this unit pop up on Amazon for $ 399 during the black Friday sale , I too be somewhat skeptical b\/c I could not find any real info or review . since the purchase I contact MartinLogan and ask about this setup , and they let I know this be not make in house-but rather make in China . they do stand behind the product , and feel even at the retail of $ 1,299 its still a amazing set . for more info visit : -lrb- ... -rrb- for a receiver I purchase the Pioneer vsx-1020-k 7.1 Home Theater I will post full sound detail shortly .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	Onkyo have be know for they strong home theater reciever and there speaker . the ht-s650 be a strong package with good quality feature . the Onkyo reciever deliver 100 watt to each channel with build in Dolby Pro-Logic 2 -lrb- for VHS movie -rrb- Dolby Digital and DTS decoding . with its WRAT -lrb- wide Range Amplifier Technology -rrb- , this reciever be build to last . it be input and output include S-Video , Optical Digital , and a 5.1 Channel input -lrb- for dvd audio and sacd -rrb- . the Onkyo speaker sound great . the front speaker be magnetically shield so the speaker be strong and give out good quality sound . the Center and Surround speaker be well balance with 4 '' woofer and 1 '' balanced tweeter . the subwoofer have a build in 150 watt amplifier with a 8 '' long-throw woofer , so you 'll be sure that you be get deep bass . the package also include a remote for the reciever , speaker cable , and a instruction booklet . even though it do not come with a dvd player , its still a great system for people who be new in the home theater world or just for people who like to upgrade they small system . Great Value .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I purchase this system in Aug 2004 and I be very pleased with its performance . Recording be very easy and I especially like the time-slip feature this allow you to watch a show from the beginning and continue to record the program . so long vh tape forever ! the system deliver a terrific picture and the sound make every show , movie , and sport event a new experience . I also enjoy the am-fm radio that be build into the unit . I be sure that the high-end system blow this unit away but for the money and the size this be a great buy !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I really like this sound bar . the rear speaker be wire to the sub and the sub be wirelessly connect to the sound bar . I have the same problem with the LED 's after 1 day . a call to Vizio support fix the problem . just disconnect power to the sound bar and press the power button on the sound bar for 1 minute . then reconnect the power and the LED 's work again . if it be not for this I would have rate it 5 star . also it be $ 50 less at Walmart . com . sound be not audiophile quality but close enough to impress . Works better on movie than music and eliminate run wire all around you room . definitely worth the price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I receive my norcent dp1800 17.12.03 . I be so excite with it . I set it up immediately . it sound great . my wife and I first watch lord of the Rings & quot ; the two Towers & quot ; at first she say where be the bass , I think it would have have more bass , and then it hit she wow what great sound . she be not easily impressed , but she be with the dp1800 . the only thing though be that the power can not be turn on or off with the remote . other than that , I recommend it to anyone who be interested in a highly efficient low price range home Theater System . it be a great buy .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	... look for a decent , reasonably price unit in store be a joke , so do not waste you time . after look on line , we take a chance on this unit , and have not regret it . I be sure there be better system out there , but you will pay a arm and a leg for they . this one do the job and be more than worth the money and trouble to order it on line . the only complaint we have be that the system will not allow you to control the speaker individually , but I be not sure that this be a option that any system give you , so take that comment with a grain of salt . other than that , the sound be great , the system be aesthetically please , and if you already have a dvd player and do not need a system that include one , this be a must purchase for you .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be my first review ever on Amazon and want to state how pleased I be with my Vizio Surround Sound system . it sound great and I barely have to turn up the sound 1\/4 of the way before produce clear sound . I have a open sit area where the family spend most of the time and it sound very well . I have not have any problem with my light go out on the sound bar as other have state . I have have it a little over 1 month and be very pleased thus far . if I start have lead issue , I 'll come back and update my review .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	the sound quality be fine , and I think it be fairly straightforward , but I do not understand how they do not have a digital audio input , which most high-end tv have . instead , you have to use analog sound , which not only defeat the point but require a converter . it be just a bummer if you be hope to make this a surround sound system for you tv .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I do not buy mine on amazon but pay 1\/2 the price at radio shack though . it be awesome . I do not know about the dt stuff but my movie , directv , music and etc sound awesome . I be glad I purchase this system . I have have it nearly a year and I love it . I will never get rid of it unless I want more wattage but at the present time 200 watt of power be excellent !!
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I usually do not leave product review but because I feel burn so badly on this one I have to say something to warn everyone else . I be actually online search for a way to remedy the pop and hiss , think I must have be do something wrong , and then I run across other review that be state the same problem that I be have . this system really be pathetic peace of junk and I have be totally embarrass by they on more than one occasion . they will pop and hiss -lrb- loudly -rrb- then the sound will totally disappear . forget this system and do not give Panasonic another dime . if I be look for a new system I would go with bose . yes , bose system be expensive but they know have payment option on they website and I can guarantee you will not get these type of review form they system .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	awesome sound for such a small system . Great for small New York apartment where space be at a premium .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	i have only have it for about a month and so far its be great i have hear all brand of shelf system and this one be the best yet you can crank it all the way up with no distortion the only drawback be if something happen to the remote you in trouble because you cant control nothin without it the cd dvd changer drawer do look flimsey but so far no problem in short if you want a nice system for the bedroom or office this be the one .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	everything seem ok about this , but I cant hear the voice channel very well . I pretty much have to turn it up to 35-40 to be able to hear much voice durr a movie ... if I could fix that I would be plenty happy .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I just buy this system to take advantage of my movie and game . and man , do it ever ! this system be great in everyway the sound be just incredable . I hook up my Sony dvd Player , XBOX , Playstation 2 , Gamecube and VCR to this system and it blow I away . it be like watch a movie for the first time and play a game for the first time . I highly recommend this system to everyone . best system ever .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I buy this dvd home Theater system a few month ago . it be not too expensive but then again it be very heavy and large and not well design at all . so if you want it to look good do NOT BUY THIS .  another problem I have with my dv-115 be that the dvd 's I play always have a `` break '' in they . this may be due to the change layer but I feel there be often more `` break '' and at different moment in the disc .  also at regular interval my player start to slow down . the picture and sound slow down , become slurred and that be not a problem with the disc because change disc do not help at all .  so when it work it be a great -lrb- albeit quite large -rrb- system , but I can not rely on it to work properly ...
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	my purchase of a nice sony 32inch wega require the accompanyment of a nice surround system . the ht5100d have a bunch of wonderful aspect . First and foremost it have amazing dt playback . with the optical cable hook up -lrb- which be not include and range from about 40-80 dollar -rrb- this system sound crystal clear . it allow you to adjust to the imperfection of you living room or anywhere else you might put this system . for example ... this system allow you to choose the surround sound quality and the distance speaker be set from one another . this allow for a excellent listen advantage in any room . another excellent thing be the cd\/dvd changer . although I think I would never need a dvd changer I be so wrong ... with the addition of almost 100s of dvd it be imperitive that you have a changer . another great thing be the visual aspect of this system . it be entirely gray ... which if you own a Wega like I match perfectly !  now a few downside ... the cd playback be a bit weak . in fact if you not run DTS the system in general be a bit weak . you need to seriously crank it to catch the key phrase . something that I do not need to do with my old Harmon Kardon system ... -lrb- of course that system break and be 100s more expensive ! -rrb- another downside be the bass . a mere 50 watt pump a un-impressive subwoofer . with such a nice high sound system I expect a bit more in the low range . of course sub be sub and you can always upgrade later , although currently Sony do not offer a great selection .  overall this have be a great system . it be powerful and what be more it be very price worthly ! you get a lot out of this system for a small price , even if it do eventually end up in a spare room somewhere it will always be reasonable . enjoy , and remember to upgrade on the cable ... espcially the optical , it make all the difference ! happy listen !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be my first home theater system so I can not really make a justified comparison with other system but as far as I can hear , the sound quality be very good , the thumping of the bass mixed very well with the satellite ... the additional feature , include Dolby pro Logic 2 that be still rare in this price range , be exceptional ... I do not know why people be complain about the remote control , I think the button be intuitively place and if you be like most people that 90 % use you rc to change channel and access menu , chance be in a month or so you would remember where the button be -lrb- and this also eliminate the complaint that say there be no control button on the dvd\/receiver it self ... let 's be honest nobody really get out of they couch to tamper with those button ... very few of we do -rrb-  now the bad ... the sound output be limit to headphone plug ... and all the bad review that this system get ... in all the site that contain this system 's review almost 50 % complaint about fault within the first warranty year ... and the fact that you can not find ANY information on this system on Samsung website be a definite sign that this system be troublesome -lrb- it be a new system , while samsung have some older system still be support on they site -rrb- ... luckily so far I have no problem at all with my system  so I guess when you decide to buy this system , even though it be a very good one for the price , in the end you really have to ask yourself if you be feel lucky : - -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	Staticy \/ teapot whistle constantly . do not support blu ray live on any disc I have try . Netcast be nice and work well , but I buy this primarily for sound and that it do poorly .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	if anyone know how to connect a pc to this receiver , then let I know ... there be only 2 input -lrb- one analog -rrb- and one supposedly digital , but the digital optical imput will not connect into my pc spdif for sound , so I can not run sound from a pc through the receiver . what be worse be that the speaker be all run off the power subwooffer , so it only will support this receiver ... really upset with this purchase consider they never provide a upgrade patch ...
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	when i first hook it up and test it , it sound a little weak , but i go through the menu and everything be turn down , like the volume for the speaker and subwoofer , once i put it up the sound be amazing , the bass come from the woofer seem like a 100 watt system rather than a 70 . i reccommend this for any room small or large , you will not be dissapointed especially at this price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be look for a home Theater in a box solution that be minimalist in appearance , without compromise on sound quality or available feature . I try the bose 3-2-1 system and cinemate speaker prior to this . I end up return both the product . for about $ 500 less , Yamaha deliver amazing sound quality in a very small footprint ! I highly recommend this product for apartment dweller or someone who appreciate minimalism . pro : - 3 hdmus input + 1 Analog - solid Build Quality + Yamaha reputation - one-of-a-kind receiver that have a built-in subwoofer - great price & fast shipping on amazon.com CONS : - the speaker bar sometimes block the infrared port on the tv , thereby make it difficult to use the tv remote . -lrb- this be really not a con , as you can dismount the leg to lower the height or position the speaker appropriately -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	buy this product last month and it have be work out really great . all cool feature and easy set up . only thing be Wireless Internet do not go well with g router so I end up have wire connection and it be work flawlessly since then . Netflix , Youtube , Pandora etc. . . work wonderfully . about wireless speaker they be still wire but not connect directly to the main speaker . so you do not need to run the wire through the room but still rear speaker need to be connect to the device which will communicate to the Blu ray player . so far,s-air be work out good . I be yet to test 3d . will update comment once I get it test . overall , great product , great feature and great price .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I be excite by all the feature offer in this unit for the price , but live with it have leave I feel otherwise .  1 . weak weak weak remote . point directly , push repeatedly , and maybe it 'll work . Buttons be tiny , not light , etc  2 . lowest volume too loud ! how can a product be make like that ?  3 . amplifier dead after 3 month of light use . I be call the company tomorrow , it be get a 1 year warranty , but I be not hopeful . even if they ship a replacement , I do not think I want it ! ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	save yourself the headcahe , find another system . all movie I have try to view on this sysyem have shut down midway . think that all my movie -lrb- which continue to play on my other dvd player -rrb- be either dirty or scratch , I have buy new movie with the same annoying result . too late for I to return this thing that I buy in 1\/07 .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	Audiovox dv1201 5.1-channel dvd home Theater System
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I purchase this home theater system base on good review on CNET , and the fact that it would be pair with a Sony lcd tv -lrb- which be also faulty-another story -rrb- . BIG MISTAKE ! the sound be not a big improvement over the tv speaker , would not read any dvd -lrb- keep say no disc -rrb- , no radio reception , hard to control with cable remote , and when I would get disgusted enough to get rid of it , could not even use the darn speaker elsewhere because of proprietary connector . the Sony `` customer service '' person , in goodness know what country , be of no help , and want my credit card number to initiate a repair order , since the product be a couple of month out of warranty . no way be I give they another cent of my money or another minute of my time . somebody kick in the rear if I ever look at another Sony product .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	o no warranty ; no address or telephone number in packing material . try 800\/726 -3801 . o 90 day warranty . unit die after 9 month . o work only with remote control supply ; no universal remote code so now I have one more clicker to kepp track of o tiny speaker supply with unit have a tinny sound ; fortunately receiver easily drive my ancient Rectilinears . also on the plus side sound level be separately adjustable on each channel . on the down side , a built-in cross-over network mean you can not eliminate they sub-par power-consuming biamped subwoofer . o if you switch from dvd to tv , dvd revert back to start of disk . a major pain as now you have to sit through a minute plus of start-up material . o you can not remove dvd 's until you switch back to dvd mode , wait a minute for warmup o almost impossible to navigate through mp3 's . o lack a mute button . oh thos enoisy commercial o Number key can not be use to select dvd chapter . o could use extra audio input for tape deck and reel-to-reel . o lack digital input for PlayStation , etc. .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	this be a complaint about the Panasonic sc-ht733 home theater system . this system repeatedly shut itself off for no apparent reason . Panasonic have I take it twice to a local electronic store under warranty but they be unable to fix it . I ultimately return it through the merchant and buy another brand . I will never buy any Panasonic product again , not because it be defective , but because of the way Panasonic address the problem . it be a big problem to disconnect everything and take it in while they perform trial and error . Panasonic should have just replace it . I do not like the attitude of anyone I speak with there . I also be not even able to complain directly to the company . on the phone they give I a case number and never follow up . a online feedback form do not work . I be through with this company .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	thats right , a home theater package in one box . I start look for a home theater system around the holliday . in the paper , magazine , on the web , and in the store . with all different kind of model and size its hard to decide what right for you . finally I decide I would just start with a simple home set up and improve from there because I do not want to pump a bunch of money in a electronics package that be too expensive or just overwhelming . I come across radio shack look for a new phone and think I would just check they out . to my astonishment they do . I download the pdf file of the manual with the spec -lrb- I will not go into all of those -rrb- and price for comparison to other system . I be also get a game console that have a dvd player -lrb- since I do not own one I could kill two bird with one stone -rrb- and want the best sound I could get without take out a loan . after look around I decide to get this system because I do not have to worry about separate multiple piece , most small system do not even have 500w , and for the money if I do not like it then I could take it back or give it to someone as a gift : - -rrb- upon inspect the system I find it fairly easy to set up . the line be color code to the specific speaker and the manual be pretty self explanitory . my wife want the speaker to be mount up on the wall -lrb- they have a service for that as well -rrb- so it be put in we den\/kitchen -lrb- call a morning room -rrb- and though the speaker look a little big they look fine after be install -lrb- ceiling be at least 12-15 ft high -rrb- . let I tell you that the sound that this system produce be truly wonderful if you be look for a starter or even and intermediate package this be it . Game playing be great , movie be like be at the theater -lrb- never go back to vh -rrb- , and if you have a party or small gathering this baby can do very nicely . even at 200w for the subwoofer it will not pack the punch you may be look for . it will not shake the wall or give you the deeeep bass like the club or a great theater but , be still nice and get the job . you can add another -lrb- shield -rrb- sub though to the reciever if you like to give you a little more umfff . I dare you to find a better system at this price ... do not bother because you will not ... I have already be do that road .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	there be a rather annoying problem regard the a\/v input which I initially think be originally a defect in my particular unit . however , it seem to be a problem with all t-352 model . when the function be set to Audio\/Video , the subwoofer rumble rather annoyingly , even when nothing be plug into the input . if you plug anything into the input , the sound still remain , and the only way to get rid of it be to set the bass volume to 0 . I do not know if it be a problem with the subwoofer or if it be just a feature , but the sound be nice and clear -lrb- with no low rumble -rrb- when play a cd or dvd directly through the unit . if you plan to connect you video game console or computer to these speaker , however , do prepare to be annoy .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this hybrid sound bar and home theater system have excellent sound and fill a average room with every detail . it sound as if you be within whatever be on you tv . however , Vizio forget about important detail when make this system . the remote be cheaply make and feel like it will break easily . a fully wireless system would eliminate setup frustration . you also need to make sure the wire be fully connect or you will not obviously have full sound . however , the system be a good deal for its price and sound great .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	look ... 1 . I do need a good quality home Theater 2 . Dolby Digital , 5.1 ch 3 . for a little room -lrb- 5 meter square -rrb- 4 . low price -lrb- if you compare about the dvd+amplifier+speaker -rrb- 5 . VCD function to play my home video -lrb- burn in a pc -rrb- 6 . strong volume but not enough to have problem with the neighborhood -lrb- and my wife -rrb- 7 . with a in-plug for the VCR .  then I compare the price for a home Theater like Sony 875 with multus IN\/OUT 's , speaker system with 500w or more ... but it be near four time more expensive ... then I return to the list above and finally my taste and my wallet be satisfy . the davs500 be excellent for a little room and for a dvd\/vcr system ... that be all ... if you want to play music you be wrong with this equipment . the sound for a dvd be a Sony sound . . clear and perfect , but if you wanna play cdmusic you will understand that Sony doen ' t want you have a sound-video system in one , it look like the system switch the sound quality if you play a dvd or a cd ... Wanna play music ?? , buy a sound system Wanna play a dvd movie ??? ... it be perfect with this machine .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	customer service - the Panasonic website claim this be very important to they . I have my home theater only 3-4 month when a VCR tape get stick . I have now be at the service center for almost 4 month ! when I be lucky enough to get a response from Panasonic -lrb- which be rare -rrb- , they make promise of completion and\/or replacement . but promise will not play the dvd 's my family would have like to watch together over the holiday . when we finally get through to the customer service center on the phone , they have the nerve to hand up on we twice . if you want a COMPANY to stand behind THEIR PRODUCTS - stay away from PANASONIC !!! I have truly give up hope of even get my home theater back from the Panasonic service center .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I think I would upgrade from the Vizio 2.1 soundbar , which perform well . my first vht510 last about three week before the blue volume , etc. , led stop work . the sound quality , in my opinion , be spectacular for the price . because the indicator light provide the only visual feedback for the various setting available , I return the unit to Amazon . the replacement unit work perfectly when I set it up . however , when I turn the unit on the next morning , I find that the subwoofer lead indicate it be not connect to the sound bar . the soundbar 's wireless function appear to have fail . two different Vizio technician be unable to to correct the issue over the phone . since this be a replacement unit from Amazon , I decide to send the defective unit to Vizio in hope that whatever problem be associate with the unit will have be correct in its replacement . we 'll see !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	SET up take 15 minute . I place the 2 inch tall sound bar on my tv stand . I do not attach the foot because it would be so tall it would block the power button of my 42 inch LG TV . I put the subwoofer on the floor , until I get a new tv stand with shelf . I twist off the cap for 6 speaker wire that go into the sound bar and the other 6 wire that go into the subwoofer . I be use to speaker wire from set up my old stereo . only the subwoofer have a electrical plug , a plain one , not the blocky one . all the input & display be on the subwoofer . I connect a hdmus cable from the Comcast DVR & another HDMI cable from the subwoofer into the tv to convey the picture , which pass thru the Yamaha unit . the Yamaha be receive Dolby Digital from Comcast . I turn off the tv 's speaker . if you wish more audio input than the one provide by Yamaha , search Amazon for `` tosklink audio selector '' I have my HP desktop pc connect with hdmus to my tv for streaming , but when connect to the Yamaha , my computer screen go blank . so , I keep the HDMI cable in my tv for picture , and connect a toslink audio cable from the pc to the Yamaha . the Yamaha be receive PCM sound from my pc -lrb- from the internet -rrb- but not Dolby Digital . the subwoofer be also a FM receiver . after I connect the little antenna cord , I be able to receive 10 or 11 radio station . use could not be easier . I turn on the Yamaha unit . I turn on the tv . -lrb- edit : with the Yamaha , my Comcast HD DVR box reset from 1080i to 720p so rather than reset Comcast cable box , I put hdmus from cable box to TV & Toslink audio cable from cable box to Yamaha , so tv stay 1080us and when need , I switch Yamaha 's audio input to the computer 's audio cable -rrb- . and , then , like always , I change the channel or volume or access Comcast 's on demand or dvr . if I want to use it with the computer , then I press `` tv '' on the Yamaha remote -lrb- because the Yamaha 's audio input be be use with the pc -rrb- . if I want to listen to FM , I press the FM button . I could not get the Comcast remote to control the Yamaha , but the Yamaha 's remote be wonderfully small and simple . performance be great . nobody should expect it to replicate the sound of huge & powerful individual speaker , or to hear surround sound , but it be a wonderful improvement from the tv 's sound -lrb- which sometimes be very good but not always -rrb- . from all source -lrb- tv , FM or PC -rrb- , sound from the Yamaha be always excellent ! I have have it for more than 2 week now and not be disappoint . test from YouTube video , the sound bar have separate leave , center , and right sound . the subwoofer 's bass be very good . the Yamaha 's FM radio be very good . from the pc , YouTube movie & tv soundtrack sound great thru the Yamaha . the Yamaha be enjoyable and fun to use . -lrb- edit : I see Yamaha have a 494 model , on Amazon & Yamaha 's website at they home theater in a box gallery , with 2 rear speaker , but they must be wire as not wireless -rrb- I highly recommend the Yamaha 400 sound bar .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	we buy this system about 4 month ago when move into a new place . when compare it to higher price Sony model and whatnot , we find this one to have the most and best feature for the most reasonable price .  Pioneer be well know for its high standard in audio quality and be probably one of the best in the industry . it have 5 speaker plus a subwoofer . the speaker be back right , back left , front right , front left , and one that go on top of you television . the overall appearance be very impressive . the subwoofer can either stand up or lay on its side , which ever you prefer . we decide to put it under the couch to create a more realistic and captivating effect .  the dolby digital encoding in this thing be superior . for example , in a movie a car could be drive from the left of the screen to to the right and the sound of the automobile will actually seem to move across you room because of the effect the speaker produce . it be as if you be actually in a theater . very deep clear sound . we preview many different home theater system from best buy and other electronics store and this one be by far the best . it have a cleaner , crisper , deeper , more resonant sound than other model such as the more expensive sony . no hiss or click sound like the other produce because they can not handle the amount of sound . also , it have ton of different preset theater surround sound you can pick from to give you dvd the best sound possible . some of they that I can remember off hand be Action , Drama , musical , virtual Surround 1 , Virtual Surround 2 -lrb- my favorite -rrb- , and there be many many more that I can not remember right now .  another feature that make this model superior to its competitor be that it be all in one unit . the receiver and 5-dvd changer be all in one so you do not have to worry about the bulk that other system cause . this be especially helpful if you live in a small place or a apartment ... or if you just do not want alot of equipment take up alot of space . we have ours in a small stand with a VCR and Playstation 2 and everything fit just fine . also , if you be worry about the 5-dvd changer ... I have have some in the past that have break , but this one be incredibly smooth and do not glich at all . Superior workmanship .  one of the best thing about this system be that you can run anything through the surround sound system . we go to RadioShack and buy some extra cord and be able to connect we VCR and Playstation 2 through the surround sound system . you would not believe the effect this thing produce . it be amazing . when you can not rent something on dvd , you can rent it on VHS and still get the same surround sound effect . there be probably even a way to hook the actual tv through the system , but we have not figure it out yet , or we have not buy the right cord . but it do have a tv option , so I be sure that you could .  another thing that I must add in be the amazing quality of video . this dvd system produce crystal clear picture . you can definitely tell the difference between a movie in my Sanyo VCR and a dvd in my Pioneer . also , I use to have a Panasonic dvd player prior to this purchase , and the Pioneer look 10 time better . very clear . great color balance and depth . amazing .  Pioneer definitely take a step up with this home theater system . the all around package be just incredible . the $ ... you be spend be definitely worth it . especially since some of the higher price model do not even have many of the feature or sound capacity that this model pack . we already know Pioneer be great with sound , and now the Video capability open up a whole new world of Home Theater Entertainment .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have have this soundbar for almost a month now and want to spend a good amount of time listen to it before I write up a review . for the price this be a awesome soundbar . the setup be easy and quick ; for some reason I expect the subwoofer to be wireless too , but no biggie . the soundbar itself be a-lot smaller than I have initially expect , I know it be thin but I do not expect it to be that thin . the sound that come out of those small driver be bigger than I expect too . the subwoofer + receiver be nice and convenient but do not plan on expand you sound system with it . the subwoofer and soundbar be paired nicely , the bass be generally where it should be . I have have a Sony home-theater-in-a-box which have bass that be muddy and overwhelming , this be a pleasant change . the subwoofer level be adjustable too which be very convenient for movie . tv : compare to tinny sound tv speaker , this do a awesome job . there be a big spectrum of sound tv speaker just can not produce and this Yamaha setup do a good job of fill that in . the sound be good , voice can be a little nasal sound but it be not super noticeable . the Uni-Volume feature be a big plus , it crunch some of the dynamic range but work as intend keep the commercial at the same volume as the show you be watch . movie : in term of immerse you into the movie , this system do a good job . I use the Extended Stereo mode which the make the sound more room filling -lrb- work well for tv too -rrb- . however I do not use the Surround Sound mode , you need a small living room with wall relatively close to the soundbar for this to really work at all . I try it but thanks to the wall be so far away the sound be scatter and not well image . music : this be a little bit disappointing , I be expect music to perform as well as tv or movie do but it just do not . I listen to elbow 's album `` the seldom see kid '' and immediately notice a lack of clarity and imagery in the sound . there need to be more instrument separation and overall just more definition . I be expect it to be a little bit better than it be . but this come from someone who own a pair of Sennheiser HD650s and have a pair of swan m200mkiii for he computer audio setup , if you be not a audiophile you will not notice . conclusion : for a quick and easy home theater setup , this do a pretty good job . there be nothing that it really do not do well , music be a little disappointing but it still do alright . however this system can not defeat the law of physics ... even though the sound be room filling , you can still tell it be come from tiny speaker . if you have a big living room , do not expect this soundbar to do that well , you need BIG speaker for BIG and FULL SOUND . a pair of floorstander or bookshelf speaker will do much better , even if you have a small living room . for a soundbar though , this be a nice setup from Yamaha .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I set this up as a secondary home theater system in my home . although not as detail as my main system , I be very surprise by the sound quality for the price . excellent for movie , but a bit harsh for pure music listen for my taste . the sub could be a little more refine , but it be adjustable . if you be look for decent movie sound on a limited budget , I do not think you can go wrong here .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	very please with this product . very easy to setup , and the integrate subwoofer\/tuner save a ton of space . all component can fit within exist tv stand , minimize clutter . sound be great . will not compete with a true-surround setup , but the point with this product here be to get as close to that without run wire or spending over $ 500 . would recommend to anyone look for a simple , affordable and quality set up for a single room set up . the optional ipod cable be a complete waste of money , can not believe they expect someone to shell out $ 60 for it ... I opt for a $ 2 aux out cable instead , and it sound great .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the Samsung ht-c6600 be a great product for the price that I get it for . some review give it a low rating because of the sound . I think that the sound sound great and that that it be clear and crisp enough for I . I be not a audio file so it could be just ok for some . I think that it be a great start if you do not have a system now . one issue that I do have be connect it to my exist Linksys 54GWRT Wireless Router for Steaming Internet and Computer file . I have recently purchase a new Wireless Router because my Linksys be go on 4 year . hopefully , that will fix the issue . good buy and I would recommend it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	excellent product , easy set-up , solid remote , quality finish , beautiful sound ... the audio easily fill we 450sq foot tv room . we use the product with we Sony 55 inch lcd . I have yet to figure out how to sync the Sony remote with the system . however I can not complain Yamaha produce superior product !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	the 5 dvd changer be great . the sound quality be above what you would expect from a system of this cost level . a little light on the high end I feel but really depend a lot on you sound source as well . some say they think the bass be weak but I find if I put the sub-woofer box on it be back point up to the ceiling I get great bass . more than I want . Speaker placement be everything . try several different placement and hear the difference . all in all I be very happy except I wish the high be a little more tinkly .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	get it at Circuit City for $ 120 ! lot of bang for the buck . Plays almost all type of dvd and cd out there . so it be get only one audio input -lrb- and rca at that -rrb- , the 200w be more than enough for a medium size room .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	the main unit have a slick , slim design . the speaker be solid look . all the need cable be include , and everything be color code and label . then I turn it on .  First , whenever power be apply , or mode -lrb- disc\/tuner\/aux -rrb- change , a disturbingly loud `` klunk '' noise be make . the unit always power up in disc mode , and will not respond for several seconds while it try to load a disc . setting -lrb- such as volume -rrb- be often lose or different when change between mode . many function be not available in all mode . for example , `` mute '' only work when play a disc . the equalizer only apply to audio cd . and so on .  i find I have to wait one or two seconds after press a button before the unit respond . if I press additional button before the unit be ready , it sometimes do not respond , or do the wrong thing .  sometimes , while change between mode -lrb- e.g. , from radio tuner to aux in -rrb- , the disc tray would eject a inch or so out of the unit , and then stop . this be especially ironic give that the eject button do not function unless you be in disc mode .  audio and video artifact -lrb- pop , click , on-screen flash , etc. -rrb- occur when navigate dvd menu .  worst of all , the unit lock up several time play dvd . the picture would corrupt , then everything would just stop . I have to unplug the unit , and then plug it back in , to get it to respond again . this happen on several different dvd , include a brand-new , just-opened disc .  i return the unit to the store . I be not expect much , but this model fail to meet even basic expectation .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the product be awesome , no complaint about how it work and sound but be careful , this be not a 100 % wireless system . I think it be from what I read but ... surprise !! you will still have run cable behind you couch !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be really please with this system . I buy this for a office in my house so I be look for something small , cheap and high quality . there be a combination that you do not find often . you certainly do here though . the receiver itself be quite small as be the speaker . setup be very easy . each speaker cable have a color code connector so it be pretty hard to get wrong . the length of cable for the front 3 speaker be fine though I have to add some extra for the rear speaker . the main selling point for I be the fact that this unit have 3 hdmus in . it allow I to connect my cable box , Mac Mini and match Sony Blu Ray player and switch between they very easily . I find no other system in this price range that have the diverse in and out that this have . one thing that concern I be whether or not the remote code would work with my Verizon Fios box . none of the build in Sony code work , but the auto scan feature find a matching code pretty quickly and it work great . it so nice to only have to use one remote 95 % of the time . I be pleasantly surprise by the sound of this system . I be not say it be go to please the serious audiophile out there , but for its give purpose , it be excellent . I would actually say that the surround decoding be supperior to the far more expensive system I have attach to my primary tv setup . the only knock I can give this thing be that it have very few physical button or knob . almost everything have to be do with the remote . this , in and of itself , be fine . it make setup a bit of a headache though . there be lot of drill through menu to find what you be look for . you should only need to do this once though and the menu be logically organize - just time consume to sift through . overall , for $ 199 ship , I really could not be happier . I would recommend this system to anyone . it would even work fine as a primary system as long as you understand that its not that $ 1000 system you have have you eye on .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I be not expect amazing sound quality . the sound quality be acceptable for what it be . I be incredibly disappoint that I can not run my WDTV Live through the receiver . I guess the video do not pass through ? I do not know . if I be not so lazy I would return the unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	this be my first home theater system and it sound great . it be easy to set up and connect the speaker . the reciver be limit on its feature but it sound great when watch suround movie . the only drawback be the system do not sound good when listen to just music .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	flat out the best system at this price . the sound quality be just what you would expect from JBL . have the 5 disc changer make it perfect for party ... . set the CD 's in the player and just let it do it be thing . the compact speaker will surprise most people when they first see the small size , but the sound that come out of they will blow they away . more option than I can even go into -lrb- i. e : DSP imaging , sleep timer , dvd option -rrb- . get it and enjoy .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	not a big reviewer guy , but after read all the negative review on this item , figure it be my responsibility . the Vizio surround system be awesome . amazing sound from a center bar , sub and satellite . I be honestly amaze you can pay less than 500 buck for something that plug into you tv , no amp , no receiver , and it sound this good . watch the world series sound like I be sit in the stand . there be even a drunk guy over my right shoulder yell `` let 's go Rangers . '' maybe other have older model before they fix the led or whatever , but this thing be awesome .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	nice little system I pick up from Sears as a open box item . Easy to operate , put together and use right away . decent sound and function as expect for my current need ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	customer service - the Panasonic website claim this be very important to they . I have my home theater only 3-4 month when a VCR tape get stick . I have now be at the service center for almost 4 month ! when I be lucky enough to get a response from Panasonic -lrb- which be rare -rrb- , they make promise of completion and\/or replacement . but promise will not play the dvd 's my family would have like to watch together over the holiday . when we finally get through to the customer service center on the phone , they have the nerve to hand up on we twice . if you want a COMPANY to stand behind THEIR PRODUCTS - stay away from PANASONIC !!! I have truly give up hope of even get my home theater back from the Panasonic service center .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	very nice system once you play around and tweak the setting . I buy this to supplement my awful tv speaker . I be a bit annoyed with how high you have to turn the volume up to really hear the roundness of the system . and my biggest problem be the add on speaker Onkyo sks-22x -lrb- center + surround -rrb- I guess this be a problem with Amazon.com not carry the add on speaker . I have be search high and low to locate the add on speaker without luck . and it seem you can only get the add on package from Europe after spend a crazy shipping cost , who want to do that . so I wish Amazon would start supply these add on speaker please . overall not a bad little package for the buck .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	if you be look for a entry level speaker\/home theater setup , buy these . you will not be disappoint . clean crisp sound at a great price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I purchase this system three week ago along with a 60 inch plasma television . I be not sure what the other viewer be look for with this system , but I be absolutely enjoy it and my family and friend love this system also .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	need something to compensate for my Samsung lcd 's less than ideal acoustic . simple to setup , unobtrusive , great separation , rich complex timbre . yes , the light indicator do stop work after a few day , but so what ? you listen for sound change , rely on visual signal be redundant .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I have a little trouble hook it up to the television . I have to call tech support a we get it hook up to my direct tv cable box a it work just fine ! clear sound a everything .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I purchase a Samsung HT-DM150 Home Theater System to complement the Samsung 27 '' hdtv I have get for my bedroom sit area . it be a great compact system for a compact room . I would not recommend use it in a large room , but it certainly provide enough power for a small room . the manual be adequate , but could provide a little more detail . connect and configure the system be straightforward and very easy to do . once everything be up and run , I proceed to test the system out . the picture quality through the component cable be exceptional and the sound be clean with little perceptible distortion . the system easily handle the various dvd I throw at it and be able to provide volume level a lot higher than I expect . the remote control leave something to be desire , but most oem remote do . still , the machine be everything I have want and I do not have to shell out a lot of cash to get it so I be very happy and very imporessed with Samsung . unfortunately , my enjoyment of the system do not last long . apparently , the unit run extremely hot and the fan may not provide enough cooling . around 1.5-2 hour into watch dvd , the system refuse to display a picture on the screen . the unit be very hot and the fan apear to have stop . only after I turn the power off and then turn it on again , do I receive a picture . I have read about this issue when research the product , but think it might have be correct . guess I be wrong . the unit I have be not enclose in a cabinet , but lie on a open shelf expose on all four side , so it be not a issue of improper ventillation . I plan to take a look at the fan and see if there be some way I can fix it myself before return it to the store for a replacement or store credit . I hope there be a solution , because frankly , I would hate to have to shell out more cash for a system that do half of what this one do . to sum it all up , for the price , the feature can not be beat . just be aware the unit do run rather hot and you may have some issue with the unit not work . if Samsung address these problem , they 'll have a killer system . so 2 star because of the low power and poor reliability as a result of cooling . if not for the cooling issue , I would give the Samsung ht-dm150 at least 4 star .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy this for a small 1br apartment and it be everything I could ask for and more . I spend a long time compare Home Theatre Systems and choose this one because it have the most feature at a reasonable price point . I have a Sony Bravia 32 '' that connect to the stereo system and that make it very easy to control volume and power on\/off the system and tv together use the original tv\/cable remote . the three HDMI port be great for CABLE , PS3 , and a extra port to connect my laptop , and when the system be off the pass-through option allow you to continue use you tv as if the system wasnt connect . the speaker and sub woofer sound great and I love the auto-calibration mic , it make everything very simple . there be more than enough wire for front and rear speaker , the center speaker cord be a little small , and the gauge be just the right size to be hide from sight under carpet and around wall . the hts-s370 be a great buy and make play video game and watch tv and movie more enjoyable . pro : great sound , lot of wire , easy setup con : none ! note : I be not too sure why , but I use lcpm on PS3 and still my video game play in 720p not 1080p
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	good sound from a budget system - only flaw be I could not get the hdmus to work , have to connect use analog video cable . first unit I buy have a defective dvd player , Amazon swap for a new unit with any cost to I - very pleased with Amazon 's service !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this system be definitely a good value for those want to add home theater in a small room . it be worth keep in mind that this system do not have as much power as higher-priced system , and the speaker and remote be make of a somewhat cheap-looking plastic . that say , it do a great job of fill the living room of my one-bedroom apartment .  where this system fall short I think be in its ability to handle music on audio cd . for some reason , no matter which setting I try -lrb- regular stereo or tweaking it with Dolby pro Logic -rrb- audio cd sound flat and lackluster . the problem seem to be that the include front speaker be very small and do not do a good job handle the mid-range common in rock music . the subwoofer tend to dominate and create a muddy effect . I plan to replace the front speaker with a better set , but this be slightly complicate by the non-standard connector on the back of this system -lrb- a plug instead of the usual `` pincher '' -rrb- .  the dvd player be first-rate . the picture quality be outstanding and I particularly like the quality of the picture when scanning -lrb- fast-forwarding -rrb- -- something which a lot of dvd player do not do well . set up and operation be also a real breeze . this system be much easier to use than some other that I have try .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be a steal at $ 199.00 . I purchase this system as a gift for my mom . this be a awesome system for someone who want surround sound but do not want a sub woofer that be go to rattle the wall . I can not believe the clear and well balanced sound that come out of the speaker . we hook up a dvd player and dish receiver to the system . if you use a optical cord , you do not have to switch the receiver back and forth to the dvd player and dish receiver . the switch be automatically do . all and all if you look for a excellent system and do not want to spend a lot of money , this be the one to get !!
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I have own this dream system for 3 year , and have have continuous trouble with it . first malfunction be when the unit 's disc eject mechanism break . second malfunction be when the unit start to experience startup trouble and would repeatedly cycle through its power-on\/power-off sequence . the latest malfunction involve a annoying high-pitched whine emit from the speaker when the unit be play in Video 1 or Video 2 mode . unlike other owner who experience this problem , I be not willing to open the casing and poke around at the unit 's innards . I be just feed up with this system and would discourage any prospective buyer from consider this unit or any future model brand Sony dream system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	well the panasonic hometheater system sound be great and the picture be great , however the pop sound only appear when i play my vanilla sky , matrix reload and l.a. confidential dvd 's . the first 2 dvd title show a small amount of pixellation ... there like little color square that appear for less than a sec and sometimes interrupt sound but not everytime i play the disc .  i try those dvd 's on my sony dvd player and the disc be perfect . no scratch , no fingerprint , no pixellation and no dust . my l.a. confidential dvd never play well with the panasonic system , with the sony it be perfect . if someone can tell I why i get this little color square but the disc be perfect .  this panasonic home theater dvd really disappointed I when i play those disc , and how now what other dvd 's get those little annoying square and what annoy I the most be that they dont always appear on the same chapter , sometimes not at all and sometimes they do appear .   1 star for the problem , cuz the sound and picture be great but the little square really tick I off . be there something i can do to stop that from happen ?
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	nine month ago I think I be buy a good value product but now I realize that I buy a bomb ... the whole system stop work with a dvd inside . I could not manage to open the dvd ... worse , the service center that I be call do not work anymore ... do not buy from KLH never ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I buy it a couple of month ago after read all the good review . my expectation be probably too high for the price . just so so sound quality that you can get from auto speaker . again , not terribly bad consider money , but if you want nice home theater quality , I recommend invest a little bit more and go to other speaker set .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	the positive review of this system be not a fluke . this be a solid , inexpensive way to improve on tv speaker if you want better sound but do not want to spend a bundle on a sound bar or a real surround sound system . I say `` real '' because this be not a Dolby Digital 5.1 system , the current standard . there be three input , and all three be stereo -lrb- l\/r -rrb- input . what come out appear to be pro-logic , although I have not be able to confirm that in any of the spec . that say , by balance the speaker volume -lrb- you can independently control the volume for center , rear , front , and subwoofer channel -rrb- , you can get a nice , room-filling sound that allow for dialog through the center channel and music through all 5.1 , close enough to Pro-Logic for my limited need in this room . and bear in mind that most 2.1 system on here be not much cheaper . so why not opt for the extra speaker , even if they do not get discreet audio ? room-fill if you room be small , that be . I put this in a bedroom , which be nice thanks to its compact size . what be more , there be a remote , which the comparable Coby system -lrb- retailing here for $ 40 -rrb- do not have . the speaker wire length be generous enough for small room -lrb- and you do not really want this for large room -rrb- . and despite the towering picture , this be a small , very small , unit . the subwoofer can almost -lrb- though not quite -rrb- fit under the bed . all in all I give this 5 star as a worthwhile product for the price . obviously , up against true 5.1 system this do not measure up . but for $ 55 , you get -lrb- at least -rrb- what you pay for .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have a Logitech 5.1 system and need a basic mount that would match the style of the speaker while not look too obstrusive . these mount fit the bill . though the mount come with a variety of screw , bolt and fastener , I end up have to buy other which fit my particular speaker . I chalk that up to Logitech , not the mount themselves . once mount on the wall , I like the amount of adjustment that be possible with the mount . it help when you be look to direct the speaker at a particular spot . my speaker be small , say 4 '' wide by 6-7 '' high and 4 '' deep so the plastic mount do not seem to be under a lot of stress . but if you have larger or heavier speaker , I would look elsewhere . I recommend this product to anyone with smaller speaker !!!
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the five 2-way satellite speaker be really cool .  if you like movie , then then 50-watt power subwoofer in a front-firing bandpass will be you favorite . all speaker magnetically shield against video interference , so it be easy to find a good location around you living room .  subwoofer feature power switch and level control , plus line-level and speaker-level input , with feed-through to satellite  it be great for entry level .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	just like many other be complain the display stop work a few week before warranty expire . I do not have a chance to call tech support to get it fix and now they will not fix it . I think panasonic make good product and in fact they be on top of my list until now .
