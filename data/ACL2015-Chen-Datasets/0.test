Sandal	POS	5	I purchase a pair of these in 2004 -lrb- it be now 2012 -rrb- and the strap between the toe finally break . I would wear these for about 6-8 month out of the year . the only reason they break today be because I be out in some really sticky and deep mud and the suction from I pull my foot out finish they off . they be very durable as I have be hike with they , and have wear they as rigorously as any shoe . I just purchase a new pair . I remember the break-in period to be about 2 day -lrb- form the leather in between the toe -rrb- and they will float in water and water do not ruin the leather in any way that I can think . best of all these do not leave any black stuff on you foot !!
Sandal	POS	5	Got these for my husband for Christmas and he love they ! we be avid hiker and have always be impress with keen footwear , and these do not disappoint . good combination of function and comfort .
Sandal	POS	4	great sandal ! there be a breakin period but once you get over that they be great .
Sandal	NEG	1	I order this pair of shoe for my husband 's birthday . he be a 10w so I order a size 10.5 think it would be plenty big . my son have a pair of Keen 's and they run true to size . well I be wrong . so I follow the instruction on the shipping label I get from Backcountry -lrb- a Amazon vendor -rrb- to exchange they for the next size up . Backcountry credit the return , but do not notify I that they received\/processed the exchange . when I call to ask if the larger size be on the way , they say since it be purchase through Amazon they would not pay the shipping on the way back . so now I be out $ 12 for return shipping , no shoe , and very disappointed at the lack of coordination between Amazon and its vendor . I will not be order anything like this on Amazon again !
Sandal	POS	5	I abolutely love this product . the fragrance balance be perfect . not too strong but do not fade with the day . it be one of the few product that do not cause a allergic reaction with my skin . I wish that bath and body work would start make and market it again . bottom line : Love the product . furstrate with the company .
Sandal	NEG	1	very Disappointed . these be be return because they be NOT German make Birkinstocks , they be stamp on the bottom make in china -lrb- with USA and a number on the footbed ... would that be a patent number ? -rrb- . although the foot bed may be shape like a original Birki there be not enough height from the foot bed to the strap esp . on one sandal -lrb- ? -rrb- . they also appear to be make for the thin foot . I wear the Caribbean make in Germany waterproof sandal and have several pair . I highly recommend they for comfort and durability . the Amazon description of the Waikiki lead I to believe I be get german birkenstock sandal , make in GERMANY . I do not see CHINA any where in the Amazon description , do I miss it ? I do not buy make in China shoes\/sandals and would never ever have order these have I have accurate info .

Sandal	POS	5	these be without a doubt the most comfortable flip flop I have ever worn . it take a few day to break they in but be totally worth it . if flip flop be you foot wear of choice in the summer you will find it worth splurge on . the more they get wear the better they look as well . I be a Rainbow customer 4 Life !
Sandal	NEG	1	beside from be the wrong color , the sandal I get be fake ... not real Rainbow flip-flop ... couldnt ask for a exchange because im currently outside the US , and it would take too much time and effort -lrb- and of course , money -rrb- to send they back . be aware , look can be deceive -lrb- specially with the picture they show you -rrb- .

Sandal	POS	5	love the product , but I should have order one size larger ! of course , it could be that I be so use to my older pair of zorry , thong , sandle , flip-flop , whatever you wanna call 'em , I just need to wear these new one in a bit ! nice and snug , so maybe it be just I ! nicely make and they look like they 'll last for a long time ! I love the thick sole !
Sandal	POS	5	these sandal be wonderfully compfterble . they look great and to top it all this be a quality shoe . the soft footbed feel great and be defenetlly worth the extra cost . you should know that they run quite large and wide . one of my best purchese ! I reccomend highly .
Sandal	POS	4	looks\/feels good but the sole be a little too stiff for my liking ... get to be uncomfortable when walk around a lot
Sandal	NEG	1	today be a first and only day i put these shoe on - and it will be the last one indeed . poorly , ill design product , horrible sole that twist foot with every step - I wish I try it on sooner - now I can not even return it . really bad product . P.S. and that be not even get to the part where I will have to say that `` leather '' look like cheap plastic they use for packaging and it shine just the same , and smell ... OMG ! have to admit - that be my first ever Stacy Adams and I will happily get back to Cole Haan and Allen Edmonds - as always you get what you pay for ...
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these for my boyfriend who always wear flip flop . he have diabetes now and I have always be concern about he foot . he really like they and I be totally jealous that I do not have a pair with the soft footbed . he wear a large size and with amazon prime , I only have to pay $ 94 ! amazing Amazon.com come through again .
Sandal	POS	5	I advise who like to be sandal ... this Tonga Sandal very comfortable and too fit my foot . . and also to light ...
Sandal	POS	5	my husband love these sandal . he be a general contractor and usually wear boot , and be notoriously hard on shoe . these sandal have last for 4 year ! they be substantial enough to provide support and protection , and the fit be adjustable , with the bungie cord . waterproof , sweat proof , odor proof . they be finally wear out and I can not order more from this site , because - I CA not see what SIZE THEY be ! even if I miss it somewhere , it should be more noticeable . jeeze . find what you be look for , they have it for a great price , but I do not want to end up with sandal for decoration if they be the wrong size !
Sandal	POS	5	I do not love they as much as the previous very similar style I buy back in 2004 that fall apart , but they be just as comfortable . other than the texture change , there seem to have be a slight change to the insole as the rubber suction onto the bottom of my foot when the other one never do that - same size , same comfort , same feel otherwise . minor annoyance & I hope the adhesion stay better on this pair . I wish I have realize sooner that I could have have Birkenstock repair the other one - lesson learn . though I will always buy these again for they comfort , great traction , & wet versatile .
Sandal	POS	5	I hate wear shoe . I buy these to add to my collection of flip flop and sandal . they appear to be very well make and durable . the color and design work well for I and they be very comfortable to wear .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy my first pair of Birkenstock sandal about 4 year ago on sale at the mall . they be the Gizeh model , very cute . they eventually mold to the shape of my foot and become my default shoe ever since . eventually I wear out the sole , and now I be even wear out part of the cork , so I decide to buy a new pair . -lrb- I know I can get the old one repair , but I really want a pair of Arizonas as well -- plus if I repair the old shoe without have a new backup pair , whatever would I wear ? -rrb- when I buy my first pair on Amazon I have no idea about the different width -lrb- narrow vs. regular -rrb- . I do not even pay attention to what my old sandal have say , whether the little foot icon be fill in -lrb- indicate narrow width -rrb- or just a outline -lrb- regular -rrb- . and now all the writing be wear out in they , so I can not tell either way . I figure since I be a regular width in everything else , I 'll buy my usual size -lrb- woman 's 7.5 equal 38 in birkenstock -rrb- . so I buy a 38m at first , but that be a mistake . they be so wide on I ! and I do not buy narrow size in any other shoe . so I instead go for a 38n -lrb- which if I have read , be suitable for a-b width , and most woman 's shoe be b width -rrb- . they be perfect ! as soon as I try they on I love they . the synthetic Birkibuc material be comfortable and stylish , and the stone color go with anything . my coworker even think they be leather ! and now I can totally rock that `` hippie sock with sandal '' look . so fashionable .

Sandal	POS	5	beauty , style and venerability be write all over this sandal . you just cant seem to stop look at it even when its not on you foot . its like check out you bentley in the garage not to know if its safe but just to keep see its remarkable beauty . the quality it have in beauty it also have in style and durability . i be the type of person that love to buy new shoe all the time , but with this sandal , i guess my buying day have come to a end -lrb- for sandal -rrb- because i dont think i can ever grow tired of it , and neither will it let I go easily . i guess im stick with it for life . its a very good shoe for those that want to spend good money which be hard to come bye on a pair of shoe that will last and last and last .

I must say that this all begin with umbro and sweatpant . when I be 7-12 year old , I only wear umbro and sweatpant , despite mock cry from my peer . at some point in the 7th-8th grade -lrb- shockingly around the time I discover a appreciation of the female body -rrb- , I give in and start wear Levi 's and Boss jeans to school . Pretty much the spit image of cool . I even cut down my wearage of NBA jersey . I know , it be hard to imagine a time when the lady be not go crazy for Jerry Stackhouse Pistons jerz . give up on sweatpant kill I a little inside , and I have be die a slow death one cut at a time as I adopt another trend . so , in summation , thanks a lot all you woman out there for make I wear comfortable leather sandal , you self-righteous man-killer . anyway , in more product-review news , these thing be absolutely awful to break in . literally , it take month , and I do know the definition of `` literally '' . my girlfriend just make I throw away my 4-year old pair and buy a replacement , and my foot now look like size 13 swiss cheese . thanks again .

Sandal	POS	5	by far , the best thing I ever put on my foot . bought my first pair over four year ago and my cat immediately decide they be the enemy . he leave some pretty deep tooth mark on the side of the sole . no big deal , I think , because like most thong sandal they probably will not last that long . four year later , I be still explain why `` those sandal you wear constantly '' have feline inflict battle wound . if those sandal be a truck , they would have make it 750,000 mile before crump . do I forget to mention they be comfortable ?

Sandal	POS	5	shoe be fantastic , I be recommend they by a friend . the only thing I can say be that the size guide on amazon.com do not match the manufacturer 's one . e.g. on Amazon a UK size 8.5 need a US size 9 . however keen website -lrb- and the box they come in -rrb- say that a UK 8 be a US 9 . double check people ...
Sandal	POS	4	I buy the black premier leather double layer . pro comfortable after a couple day of break they in . durable . I have wear they for extend period in some harsh condition and be surprise they do not break . con they have a very strong paint thinner smell for about a week . if you wear they wet they will stain you foot dark black . price Mine be about 1 year old . the color be kind of fading and the leather sole be pretty mess up from water and sun damage . I still wear they because it be my only pair of sandal right now , but I be about to order something different on Amazon . it will probably be something cheaper that get the job do .
Sandal	POS	5	these be unlike other rainbow that be all leather ; these be soft foam -lrb- like the more common reef sandal -rrb- they be very both classy and comfortable .
Sandal	NEG	2	the contour bed be nice , but the strap be very tight if you have a wide foot .
Sandal	POS	5	I be impressed . I be a little skeptical about spend close to $ 50.00 on a pair of flip flop -- especially when i can go to other place and get they for $ 1 -lrb- on sale of course -rrb- . after go to a store and purchase a pair of leather flip flop i be disappoint when the flip flop get wet my foot feel like it be slide around -lrb- not good , not to mention it feel weird -rrb- . but these sandal have make I a believer . at the begin they be a tad uncomfortable because it do take a while for they to break in -- because they form to you foot . but after a while they break in and you will have they on you foot all the time . when they get wet they soak some of the water in but they dry in minute . I hope this help -- i would definitely purchase another pair .
Sandal	NEU	3	I just receive these roday and I order they a whole size larger than my fit , they run very small because they be still too snug . I have have they on for about seven hour and besides be tight the inner sole be rough on my foot , not a very comfortable sandal . as mention in other review they be hard to get on and off . they look very nice so I be hope they will stretch out so I can keep they and I may have to wear sock .

Sandal	POS	4	I order these sandal online from Amazon , and while I do not usually shop for shoe online because of the size and have to try it out first , it be a winner . the size be perfect and the fit be very comfortable . the only reason I give it 4 star be because the price be a little high ... a hundred buck for sandal that will take some beating in walk , water ... etc. . still , they look great and fit great .
Sandal	POS	5	provide for a pleasant shave with no aroma . use it in conjunction with a inexpensive black plastic shave brush holder and plastic travel case for my Gillette Mach 3 razor . Have have 20 shave so far and it appear that the soap will last for month . suggest you take you shave brush and spread it against the sink while the water be run so that the entire shave brush be wet when lather . also , I purchase a wooden soap holder which be superior to a `` cold '' metal holder or plastic holder . best part be that I have a handy ledge build under my mirror to hold all my shaving and other necessity . now , the shave item be handy and the sink surface be best use for other item . I have use a inexpensive shave soap prior to the Geo F. Trumper sandalwood shave soap but now I have find the right brand . the sandalwood shave soap be a major part in make shave a pleasant experience each day . I be sell on the soap .
Sandal	POS	4	they take a bit of time to wear in , which be the only reason I do not give they a 5 . but they be quite comfortable , mold to you foot , and give more support than flip-flop . also , I live in New York City , and my foot get really dirty when I wear flip-flop , but because these come up a bit around you foot , that do not happen .

I live near a beach so wear sandal be a very practical thing to do , so I have worn plenty of sandal in my time . I know all type of brand and style of sandal , and this have to pretty much be the worse . as I be out , the sandal strap come apart in a completely unwarranted time . I trip because of that , and have now scar up my foot pretty good . blood similarly get all over my sandal . now , I have Hepatitis B , unfortunately , so I have to dispose of the sandal for the safety of other - particularly , my family . not much I can do about thing when I spill my blood on they -lrb- unless I want to find some way to completely quarantine the item -rrb- . so I explain my situation to the company . what do they say ? they say that they can not do anything at all . instead , they tell I to like they FACEBOOK page because I have a chance at WINNING a pair of freak sandal . yeah right , as if I be go to advertise you junk product to my friend . never purchase from this company . they do not care about you or the quality of they product . I suggest reef 's instead - actually , I suggest any other brand .
Sandal	POS	5	wonderful flip flop . I buy they as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he love they .
Sandal	NEG	2	I buy these shoe for a 2 week hike vacation in Utah . I only wear these shoe during the trip . I be happy with the comfort of the shoe however the quality be subpar . also at the end of the day my foot really smell bad . I feel that with sandal my foot would get enough air to breath unlike full on hike boot . at the conclusion of the trip the stitch on the back strap of the shoe have come undo and be very loose . not something I would expect for a shoe in this price range . I be pretty happy walk through water in these shoe . they never come off and the grip on the bottom hold up pretty well .
Sandal	POS	5	by far the most comfortable sandal I have ever own . I first see these on some ultralight backpacker I meet , they swear by they and I have to try they . now that summer be over , and it be late fall , I find myself still wear these even now that it be cooler because they feel good and I be use to they . they really be tough to give up . any reservation I have that they look funky go away when I wear they a couple of day and get hook on the feel and how they protect my toe . SIZING issue : if they do not feel right when you put they on , you may have the wrong size . most people that buy keen find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoe , so try that . comfort : the sandal have a wide toebox so that you toe be not cramp together . the protective toe guard do the job , I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these , plus I can hide my ugly toe . it also have a little rise on the rear heel that cup you heel , but also help protect you against those people that step on the back of you foot in line . it feel very secure once it be on and do not slip . there be no strap to fool with or velcro to adjust , it have a inner lining on all the strap that look like the neoprene on a scuba suit , it stretch to fit and be comfortable against my skin . it have a no-lace closure and you adjust it once , from then on it slip on easy . the footbed cradle my foot really well . it have a little ridge on the inner sole that run behind the toe and in between you big toe and other toe . the first time you feel it , it seem like a defect . but that ridge seem to shape to my foot , give I my own custom fit . I hate to gush about this , but the shape of this shoe allow my bad foot to stand longer and walk longer . I actually enjoy run in they , and for a sandal that be a definite first with I , as they usually slip and flop all over on my foot . you can even wear it into the water like a Teva . if it get wet , for some reason you do not feel it due to the material that wick the water away . grip : it have a outer sole that be very grippy , it give good traction on sand , boulder , mud , you name it . it have not be slippery on wet surface , include a boat . the sole do not leave any mark on my floor , and do not hold dirt in the groove to track indoors . odor : it have a anti-microbial treatment so I do not get odor issue nearly as much as with Crocs and other sandal . durability : it have hold up to daily wear and repeat wetting . when they get dirty , I throw they in the sink , under the hose , in the shower or even in the washer . I wear these almost daily for 4 month straight with no evidence of wear . this include standing in line all day on vacation at theme park and scramble at the beach . like other sandal , when they be new they leave mark on my sock from the dye but I almost never wear a sock with they anyway . summary : these come in a few color and in Mens and Womens style . I have try 2 pair of tennis shoe from this company , and the footbed be similar , although the one with a suede type finish -lrb- the Targhee -rrb- look like crap in one month . it be still a great hiker , but I can not wear it anywhere else but the great outdoors . the other pair be for urban use , it be call the Austin , and it be have a really nice finish . my other favorite sandal be Rieker Anti-Stress Jens 09176 , and the Dunham Moose Fisherman -lrb- design by New Balance -rrb- . I use to wear Teva 's , and they make good sandal as well . UPDATE March 2010 : I do not know if they still make these to the same quality as the model I review here in 2005 , but it be now 2010 and my original pair of Newport h2 sandal be still in use so I can not tell . the only issue be they look a little fade now in the strap and one of the stretchy tie string lay a little crooked . but they still feel great and my sole have hold up . I still feel they be a great deal for the price , about $ 100 back in 2005 .
Sandal	POS	5	the break in period be a little uncomfortable but after a week or two these sandal be amazingly comfy . I wear they everywhere and my foot never complain . delivery be quick and the whole purchase process be easy and painless . I highly recommend these sandal for anyone seek the best sandal around .

Sandal	POS	5	dog just chew up pair I have have for nearly two year . still be in great condition , just start to get a little ripe -lrb- smelly -rrb- . about to buy two pair just in case they stop make the Santa Cruz . highly recomend . also , the Sperry website sell they at a lower price .

Sandal	POS	5	we grandson be a freshman at Johns Hopkins University . he need sandal and say all the kid rave over the Rainbow Flip Flops and he want a pair for he birthday . he be thrill with they . thank you .
Sandal	POS	5	I love these waterproof sandal . they float . they fall into the pool one time and do not sink . more importantly , the contoured footbed be fantastic . it make for a very comfortable fit . for extra protection and support my local shoemaker add on a quarter inch rubber sole . I have be wear the same pair for two year now . they be strong , sturdy and hold up well .
Sandal	POS	5	when I first buy the sandal I be little spectable because , have never wear a rainbow before . at first they seem little rough and within few day they break down and adjust to my fit and the leather smoothen . now I can not tell you how much I love they and I dont even want to take they off . the leather seem to be ver sturdy and the nylon sole be very strong . overall and awesome product highly recommend . also keep in mind that they run small so need to get one size larger then you wear . for example I wear sice 8.5 and have to buy 9.5 to 10.5 and fit just fine . !!!
Sandal	POS	5	the gift recipient be very happy to receive they for Christmas and he say they be comfortable and nice look on the foot
Sandal	NEG	1	I be charge money on my credit card and never recieve the flip flop . this transaction really suck .
