GraphicsCard	POS	4	I have it plug into a work laptop . a couple of thing : First , you get message when you try to install the driver about how they be not Windows certify or approve software . second , when the computer go into sleep mode and you wake it back up it flicker a big before you can type . the only other thing be that the first time I go on a business trip and come back and plug everything back in , I have to re-install the driver and reboot the pc . I be hope that do not continue . if it do , I 'll update the review .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	if you be still stick on a agp system this be the best card you can get , be very good for a less than $ 100 . y usualy use to think that any card around $ 100 be bad and cheap , but this prove I wrong . I can even play Assassin 's creed with full graphic on 1280x1024 and dx10 with my old agp , p4 3.4 ht and 3gb ram computer . pro : great value , good performance , can be oce . con : maybe its too big to for any computer , but I manage to get into my case . final thought : if you need a agp card dont look for more , buy this one .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	First off , this be not `` the best '' card out there , however this single card can still run many of today 's modern game on high\/ultra\/max . a few exception would be game like battlefield 3 , Crysis , Starcraft II , cutting-edge game that be push the limit of today 's technology . I intend to Crossfire another one of these card within the near future which will push I over what would be require to run the previously mention game max out . -lrb- to put it in perspective it will bottleneck my CPU at stock speed . -rrb- this card run ASUS 's DirectCUII , while it be not the best look card on the market , twice the fan mean up to 20 % cooler , and significantly quieter . I can crank my card up to 55 % -lrb- use ASUS GPUTweak software -rrb- before i be able to hear they . with they default manual setting , the card constantly run at around 20 % -lrb- though I have not do any at-load gaming which would up the fan speed -rrb- , and be unidentifiable from the symphony of case fan -lrb- my case , the Antec df-85 come stock with 7 fan , with a optional 8 ` th on the left-side cutout , which I have install -rrb- Whenever possible , I opt for asus . they product be build to a higher standard , and I have only have one product partially fail on I , a ASUS monitor ship with doa integrate speaker -rrb- and this card be no exception . thus far , I have nothing bad to say about this card !

GraphicsCard	POS	4	I use nVidia card for render scene from 3d content creation software -lrb- in this case blender with its cycle GPU renderer -rrb- , so this review will almost certainly not be relevant to most of the people look at this item . I get this as a upgrade over my current EVGA gtx 550 ti -lrb- which I also use for 3d rendering but do not have enough RAM for large scene -rrb- . I do realize that these card be make with gaming in mind but give such good performance -lrb- thanks to those CUDA core -rrb- that they be a much better deal than either the Quadro or Tesla gpus . the only real downside be the heat that these generate . my old 550 would hover at a steady 80c while under load -lrb- which be for a very long time in this sort of application since the GPU will work at 99-100 % for the duration of the render - which can take between a few minute to month if you be render a longer animation -rrb- . this gtx 570 have the advantage of have 2.5 gb RAM onboard but also generate a lot more heat thanks to its higher clock speed and significantly higher core count . during render it would idle at 89-90c , which be way up there . some mess around with the include precision tuning software to up the fan speed help cool thing down a little but eventually I have to underclock the card by around 200mhz to get it down to around 80c . performance-wise it cut render time down to a quarter ! totally worth it when that mean ~ 5 hour versus ~ 20 for a image . I be invest in a couple more fan to move air in , out , and around my system . liquid cooling would probably do this wonder but I do not trust it in case of a leak in my main production machine . I would love to tell you how it run game but the most graphically demand one that I own for the pc be Bioshock -lrb- which be far from new -rrb- , which this run buttery smooth on max setting . so take that for whatever it be worth . it be worth note that I live in Hawaii and therefore have a pretty high ambient temperature : -lrb- I will upload some example screenshot of it in action . Update - 2 week later : after add three additional fan to my system I have only manage to get the GPU temperature to drop by 4c . the idea of have it burn out soon or melt down \/ catch fire -lrb- unlikely though that may be -rrb- lead I to give in and invest in liquid cooling . I get a Koolance ext-440 external all in one -lrb- pump , liquid reservoir , radiator -rrb- with a Koolance gpu-210 universal GPU cool block and some Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste . it be not cheap , but it actually run at a good temperature now -lrb- and altogether still cost less than a good Quadro card ! -rrb- . under very heavy load it stick to 60c with the standard clock setting . if I underclock I can get it to run at a steady 40c under full load . much happier now , just cross finger that I do not end up with a spill : -rrb-
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I be unable to use this product for my pc be not design to install this type of video card . sorry not use not rate .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	my pc be a very old one and do not have a pcie slot . this card fit well . installation be a snap and work very well with Windows 7 . I be able to increase my system performance from 2.0 to 3.5 with this card . however , the card 's heatsink be too tall and will collide with a adjacent PCI card . so , either it take up 2 slot or try to install in the far end slot .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I install this onto the mother board easy peasy , and boot up . go to nvidia website and it automatically update and install . this improve my computer performance , and I now have 2 monitor as a extended workspace ... it be really great !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Easy to install out of box . it generate 7.8 out of 7.9 . it allow you play most high-end game with maximum setting . but need to download newest driver from AMD website . I have research a lot on AMD 6870 and AMD 7770 . but I finally purchase 6870 due to the higher performance . recommend this card to the gamer with limited budget .

I also recommend this 4gb version versus any 2gb version . battlefield 3 at 6000x1080 and Ultra setting use 1.8 gb of vram . IMHO , it be worth the extra $ 50 for the 4gb . I forsee future game pass the 2gb mark -lrb- which would bottleneck on the 2gb card -rrb- such as Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3 . especially with high-re texture pack ! for those who be not aware , vram do not scale with slus either -lrb- so do not look for sli-ing two 2gb card to solve this -rrb- . although I have three 1.28 gb 470 's , they do not combine to create `` 3.84 gb '' of vRAM . each graphic card get `` load '' with the same file . then they split the render process between they .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	when it come down to buy a new top-of-the-line graphic card , you pretty much have two option : atus 4870x2 or Nvidia GTX 295 . the Nvidia GTX 295 be the surefire winner between these two , as benchmark after benchmark it outperform the ATI . also worth mention , the ATI have severe driver issue , and run extremely hot . the gtx 295 provide amazing graphic -lrb- better than two gtx 280 's or even 2 gtx 285 's , -rrb- run cool -lrb- about 55 c under full load with stock cooling no overclocking , -rrb- evga be one of the best manufacturer -lrb- they offer mod-friendly warranty and a 30-day upgrade grace period , -rrb- and with the latest driver run no problem . if you be go to spend hundred of dollar for top-notch computer part , you be go to want they to work without wait for month for decent driver and the gtx 295 deliver . just be aware , if you be use two of these in Quad-SLI , be aware that you will not be able to run dual monitor with xp .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this card to replace a pv-t44a-yapv-t44a-yang -lrb- basically the same card -rrb- that I think be get twitchy on my p225 CRT monitor -lrb- be shut down computer on start up , reduce color on monitor , and monitor control not work -rrb- I replace the Power supply -lrb- you usual first suspect -rrb- and the problem continue . I swap out monitor and the flat work , but my beloved CRT still have problem , so I remove the YANG card and put this one in and problem go away ; I be still not happy , as I be very anal . remove the new card and put the old one back in -lrb- it be less than two year old -rrb- and the problem be go . reset the graphic card before you do ANYTHING ELSE . Nuff say
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this be a very high quality piece , craftsmanship show . sure , there be faster card out there , but this card be run sc2 at ultra setting in 1980x1080 without break a sweat . I average 45 + fp . before overclock . for $ 160 , that be hard to top . also , the Trixx software from Sapphire be extremely easy to use .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have be wait to purchase the gtx 680 , but it have not come back in stock at msrp price . even if it be in stock , I be feel that drop $ 500 on a card would be something I could not quite justify . then I read the Toms Hardware review of the gtx 670 and be amaze at they result -lrb- this card perform within a few frame per second of the gtx 680 , a card $ 100 more expensive -rrb- . judge by how quickly the gtx 680 's go out of stock , I seek out and purchase this card from Amazon at $ 399 in less than 10 min after finish say article . the card arrive today and I quickly swap it out with my beloved Saphhire AMD HD 4870 . my system boot with no problem and within a few min I have the new GeForce driver install . for reference , I have a older quad core , the Q6700 @ 2.666 GHz , 8 gb ddr2 @ 800mhz , and a 1920 x 1080 monitor . performance Skyrim : amazing . smooth . I feel the difference immediately ; no more slight stutter when turn quickly . fireball , dragon , this card do not even blink . BF3 : turn everything up to ultra\/max . I fly a chopper over oil field while tank and infantry fire crisscross the earth . jet buzz I try to get a easy kill but I dodge they like a bad father evade child support . for the first time , battle field 3 feel fluid ; it be like I be play a new game . so smooth , so crisp ; it almost distract you from the horror that be war . Adobe CS5 : after add GeForce GTX 670 to a text file , Premiere pro implement the Mercury Playback Engine for extra hardware acceleration during editing . I open a project where as before my system would playback the video at only about 14fp ; now , with this card , it play back real time . I be able to quickly jog back and forth in the timeline without any major lag . without any modification , Adobe Photoshop detect and implement hardware acceleration . I can not wait until I get CS6 and use photoshop for video effect , I imagine this feature will help immensely . sound much quieter than my hd 4870 . I imagine this be because the older GPU be work harder and thus auto-set the fan higher . as it be with the gtx 670 , I can barely hear comp when I be wear my sennheiser pc350 headphone . AWESOMENESS Yes . my advice ; if you be wait around for the gtx 680 , buy one of these instead -lrb- provide you can find stock at msrp price -rrb- . good luck solider , you 'll need it !
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	last Update : just want to add - if you select a hdtv resolution -lrb- 720p\/1080i\/1080p -rrb- in CCC , the audio will not drop out . unfortunately for I , my lcd 's native resolution be 1360x768 so I have to choose that resolution which be consider a basic resolution in CCC . for any basic resolution , the audio will cut out . one workaround would be to run a digital coax\/optical from my mobo to the receiver , but this add a extra cable lol . I be still just use my 5770 since I be have a hard time justify the price of a 6950 since you can find a 7850 for the same price . I be hold out for the hope that AMD will release a driver fix , in which case I would repurchase the 7850 . or if Amazon would put out a deal on the LG 55LM7600 , I would get that , rebuy this card , run 1080p , and call it a day . Update 2 : well my new receiver come , Denon 2312CI , and unfortunately that receiver experience the same issue with the Sapphire 7850 as my Onkyo do , confirm by testing in 2 different computer . my old Radeon 5770 still work perfectly in both computer and with both receiver . I have come to the conclusion , that this 7850 , at least the 2 particular Sapphire 7850 card I receive , do not smoothly stream audio to a receiver over hdmus without cut out every now and then . Update : I also try Catalyst 12.6 beta , a new HDMI cable , and a different input on my receiver . I try everything except hook the 7850 straight up to my lcd and use my lcd 's speaker . this be what I just do and so far , 10 song , I do not think I have hear it skip , unless it happen so fast that I be not pick up on it . on the Onkyo receiver , when it would skip , the no audio source would show up for a second while the receiver look for the audio . I do not understand why my hd5770 would work fine with the Onkyo 707 and the 7850 would not . be it a problem with the receiver or the 7850 ? I would need either another 7850 or another receiver to confirm , both of which I do not have . I 'll do more research and update soon . : End Edit I be so stoke to upgrade my Radeon hd5770 with this card for summertime gaming . my gaming\/htpc consist of a Intel i7-860 , Asus P7P55D , G. Skill 8gb ddr3 , crucial 256gb m4 , Onkyo TX-SR707 , AV123 ELT525T speaker , and Samsung 40 '' lcd -lrb- upgrade to 55 '' lead soon -rrb- . I slap this silent beast into my computer and reinstall the newest Catalyst 12.4 driver and off I be . I do some video benchmark and then watch some YouTube video since I have a couple friend over . then something weird start happen . in about every YouTube video I play , the audio would cut out for a second , and then come back in . I have my setup as follow Video Card HDMI - -rrb- Receiver HDMI in and then HDMI out - -rrb- tv . with my previous hd5770 , all other component be the same , I never have audio cut out ever . I think it might have be a problem with flash 's hardware acceleration , so I unchecked that , but the audio still cut out for a second . I then think it be a problem with flash so I play some html5 YouTube video , still the audio would cut out for a second and then resume . then I think it be maybe a problem with Firefox , so I play iTunes on repeat , and about every 5 minute or so -lrb- sometimes less , sometimes more -rrb- , the audio would drop out for a second and then come back . so then I think it be maybe a problem with Catalyst 12.4 so I try Catalyst 12.3 and Catalyst 12.5 beta , still same problem . then I try format and reinstall Windows 7 pro 64bit , still the same problem in every application . at this point , I swap my hd5770 card back in , watch a dozen YouTube video and play iTunes for a hour or so , no skip , no drop out , everything play perfectly . so then I think maybe there be some other component in my computer that just do not play nicely with the hd7850 , so I install it in my office comp -lrb- Intel c2d e6600 , Gigabyte p35-ds3l , 4gb ddr2 , Intel X25-M 80gb , this be the computer that my hd5770 will be go in -rrb- . and in this computer too , the audio from Sapphire 's 7850 would cut out for a second and then resume in every application I try . swap the hd5770 back in and no problem . at this point , I have determine that it must be a problem within the Sapphire hd7850 . the HDMI in the card I receive just can not play media without the audio randomly cut out\/skipping . this be very unfortunate since otherwise , this be a powerful and quiet card . I have not send it back yet , still google for answer -lrb- Sapphire 's Community Run support Forum be a joke -rrb- , but I will most likely end up send it back within the next 2 week . I be weary of try another hd7850 card from a different manufacturer for fear of the same thing happen , so I may get a NVIDIA GeForce 570 GTX , even though it will run hotter and probably louder ... unless I build up the courage and money to try a radeon hd7870 .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	this card perform excellently . however within the first two week of own it I have several red screen of death . I search around online and have find many other people with the same issue . I have request a replacement from Amazon that will arrive tomorrow , if the second card be problem free this rating will go up to a four . however I can not give a five to a product that have apparently zero quality control . be wary of this line from EVGA . -lrb- ... -rrb- or just google `` EVGA GTX 670 FTW red screen ''
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this sapphire hd6870 card be a great replacement for the previous Radeon hd4850 1gb card that come with this machine -lrb- HP Pavilion elite d5200t w\/8gb RAM -rrb- originally . the primary reason for buy this card be to utilize GPU processing with non-gaming app via DirectCompute and great price\/performance . secondarily , even though I be more of a casual gamer these day I also want to have dx11-capable hardware for any new game I may fancy at some point that use it . the card be trivial to install ; simply download\/install the latest driver from AMD and you be set . overall , this card be a marked improvement over the hd4850 I have ; I would especially recommend it to anyone look to upgrade a hd4800 or lesser series radeon card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	have this card be like have too many girlfriend . lot of fun but very expensive . like all the other review I read this card run every game I have at 1920 x 1080 at max setting without a stutter . it be quieter at load than the 6970 it replace and get many more fp at higher aa setting . I love the way it throttle the frequency accord to demand to save energy . the fan on mine have never go above 60 % to keep the GPU at 80 c degree or below . my older game stay in the 40 's . I run most of my game with vsync and not see the FPS drop below 60 on any at max setting . this card be a winner !
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I love this card . it have the best performance spec that I could find for a card under two hundred . it take everything I throw at it . Skyrim , battlefied3 , The Old Republic , all at highest setting and still get good fp . I would have give this card a 5 Star rating , but no crossfire ? also this card be massive , I have to push some of my hard drive forward and finagle cable in order to get it to fit . the fan be quiet until it reach 75 % -lrb- use MSI Afterburner -rrb- or higher fan speed .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this card will display on 4 display but only by make they into two big display . the program that come with it will not work on my machine and I have to re-setup my display every time I turn on the computer . it be work with 8 display on 4 dual card but I think this might be better . it 's not !

NV K20 expect to cost -rrb- $ 3,000 in q4 2012 con : - at 1150mhz @ 1.174 v , this card will consume about 40-50w of power more than a gtx680 @ 1280-1290mhz . to I the GPU compute advantage be well worth the extra power consumption , but Kepler be still more efficient for gaming alone - I wish the copper heatpipe be nickel plate to slow down oxidation and the card have a backplate . minor personal gripe - the card be not make use the most premium high-c cap , dark choke that be present on other card such as PowerColor Vortex II and MSI Lightning . thus , there may be a chance of coil whine for some user - Performance be not as great as gtx680 in some frostbite 2.0 game : battlefield 3 , beta testing of medal of honor Warfighter - sometimes lack performance against gtx680 in less ` popular ' game : World of Planes , the secret world , TrackMania 2 , hard reset - hd7900 series can not enable they ZeroCore Power Idle save feature when connect to multiple screen additional overclocking Tips : - you may need to modify the MSI Afterburner . cfg file use Notepad to allow Unofficial Overclocking Mode 1 or 2 -lrb- if you want full ability to downclock the memory to 685mhz in idle -rrb- - in Sapphire Trixx , just keep move the slider past all the way to the limit for GPU and memory and it will keep unlock even faster speed -lrb- take I a while to figure that one out : -rrb- -rrb- you may want to disable ulp in Sapphire Trixx to aid in overclocking - there be a leak hd7970 GE Bios and some have try flash they Reference PCB card with it . the GE BIOS manually force the GPU voltage to 1.256 v at load vs. 1.162 \/ 1.174 v on the Sapphire Dual-X card . this be complete overkill especially if you do not plan on overclock beyond 1200mhz -lrb- i.e. , you 'll just add 40-50w of extra power consumption for no reason run the card at 1.256 v -rrb- . also , the xt1 revision card do not support the 50mhz GPU boost function of GE -lrb- xt2 -rrb- chip . so really I do not see any point in flash the bio to the GE version . other : - if you want to save some $ , MSI TwinFrorz III hd7950 be a great value now and can be find for $ 310-330 . I need the extra compute but for gaming alone a 1.1-1 .15 ghz hd7950 will even beat a gtx680 , negate much of the need to spend $ 100 + more on a hd7970 . - the Amazon card do not come with 3 free game voucher - Sapphire have just launch they vapor-x hd7970 ghz edition 3gb gddr5 card with vapor chamber and 1000mhz GPU clock -lrb- with 1050mhz GPU boost -rrb- . those should be available shortly . I buy this card a while back , but for those who do not , that be pretty much the successor to the Dual-X .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I keep watch for THIS MODEL NUMBER GRAPHICS CARD to come into stock , DUE to the initial shortage in MANUFACTURING . one NIGHT ABOUT 10 PM PST , THERE IT WAS in STOCK , ON SALE , AT A great price to boot . I receive it very quickly via UPS and HOOKED IT up and had it run in no time at all . what a great graphic card , one of the best on the market at THIS PRESENT TIME . thank you ` AMAZON.COM ' for get stock on THESE . I have total trust in all my purchase from AMAZON !!!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	so far so good - if I have any trouble with the card later I plan to update this review . use this card to replace a failed card -lrb- Gainward Ti 4400 -rrb- in my older Pentium 4 computer run Windows xp -lrb- motherboard : ASUS P4P800 -rrb- . it work use the exist nVidia driver that be already install , so I do not need to use the CD . I avoid use any driver supply on cd or dvd anyway - have always find it much better to download the latest driver from card maker website and avoid headache . note : this card use the older agp slot , not the newer pci-e slot , so be sure you computer have a agp slot before order this card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card work well on older pc that only have pcus slot on the motherboard . it have be work well without problem on my Windows xp Media Center Edition pc . it can play older game , such as Roller Coaster tycoon 1 and 2 . unfortunately game that be graphic hog will not work with this graphic card . otherwise the card work very well
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I order this card from Amazon , specifically because it be the right card at the right price . check out pcper.com and search hd 7850 review to see how this card stack up against the competition , and you will get a more complete picture -lrb- no pun intend -rrb- . but to summarize : at $ 250 , this card destroy the Nvidia GTX 560tus -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- and run just short of the gtx 570 -lrb- $ 300-330 -rrb- unless you overclock . the figure I be use be valid at time of purchase . you can assume the lowest possible price either at Amazon or at a competitor . further info . pro : 1 . power consumption . this card only draw about 130w on one 6-pin pcie power cord , which be ridiculously low for its capability . a pcie slot already provide a bit more than 70W , so the draw on the power supply be minimal . this mean you can upgrade without spend a lot on a power supply -lrb- minimum 500w -rrb- . the 570 need either 2 pcie 6-pin or a 6 and a 6 +2 with 550w - 600w minimum power supply , depend on sub-manufacturer . 2 . temperature . the card only run about 60 c at load , which be also very low , and this mean you do not have to worry as much about case performance to maintain temperature within operate limit . this do not mean you can leave you case a mess , but it do mean that you do not have to spend serious cash to get good airflow . good cooling = longer life . 3 . capability . the hd 7850 can maintain a good to great fp -lrb- frame per second -rrb- on the highest setting on you favorite directx 11 game . this be the programming platform for 3d gaming , and at the time of review , it be the most current form of 3d platforming . as a estimation , this card should be able to run a good fp well into the future . best guess be 2 year . after that , I would not be surprise if you be not already consider a new pc or a upgrade anyway . 4 . size . this go unappreciated by a ton of upgrader and gamer , but the size of this card make it a viable upgrade , even for micro-atx mobo and case , mean you still must measure , but it be more likely than not that this card will fit into into you case . 5 . overclocking . dl the Sapphire TRIXX app for you desktop , and you can stabilize a 20 % increase in performance . exceptional and freak awesome , mean without purchase the oc version of the card , you can crank this puppy up to way beyond stock clock for f-r-e-e . best price ever . con : 1 . performance . I be a bit disappointed this card do not lay the gtx 570 to waste , but when you consider the premium you pay for the gtx 570 , I think this card be justified . I would expect the gtx 570 & 580 to go on a significant discount for a long time with high rebate from the manufacturer because of this new series of Radeon card and the gtx 600 series , which be be release as this be type , but as mention above , power consumption and ventilation with the NVIDIA 570 be subpar in comparison . 2 . warranty . I could not find the xfx version of this card at the time of purchase , which be a bummer because XFX have the best warranty -lrb- lifetime -rrb- and customer service of any radeon sub-manufacturer . Sapphire be not a pushover with 2 year , and they have be make Radeon for a long time with great success and reliability . 3 . the answer : I be wonder whether Radeon should have design accord to a higher spec and standard ; it be as though this card be design to compete with older gtx 500 series card . I would expect NVIDIA to answer the Radeon 7800 series gpus with something exceptional as they continue to release the gtx 600 series . then again , you can always get a better deal on dated merchandise if you wait to buy ... Conclusion : you will not make a bad decision between this card and the gtx 570 -lrb- evga have a good reputation , warranty , and customer service -rrb- , but at the time of release and my purchase , the Radeon 7850 be a great bang-4 - $ card , and it deserve all the praise it receive for be a serious card at a good price with greater accommodation for more case , mobo , and power supplies than the gtx 570 or 560ti . Update 4\/24\/12 : everything still work at 100 % . battlefield 2 Bad Company be smooth as dive chocolate on highest setting . battlefield 3 seem even better . have already purchase Guild war 2 , for which I be sure this card will be overkill . BTW : run AMD 955 black , 8 gb 1300 RAM , Samsung 7200 1TB HD , 600W OCZ PSU . Update 5\/13\/12 : no problem whatsoever . play in the gw2 beta over 4\/27 -4 \/ 29 , and with the exception of a massive amount of player who take part in the good-bye extravaganza , no lag at highest setting , which be excellent for beta . Witcher run very well , but Witcher 2 seem to be the new benchmark for video card . I 'll have to nab that at some point in the future . I have have 2 reader ask I about x-fire previously , which I do not really advocate because of the relative expense . you could get a top o crop card for $ 500 , and one gtx 680 or hd 7970 will lay this card to waste . I can not give you the technical expertise -lrb- technical writer , not a engineer -rrb- to show it , but I have it on good authority -lrb- pcper.com , pcbuilder.com -rrb- that one premium card be worth more than two mid-range . that be say , if you insist on x-fire , you can only bridge 2 HD 7850s together with the current hardware . I do not see this as a `` con . '' if you be serious about gaming and would like to bridge mid-range card together , go for it . but I think that be a feature best reserve for premium stock , where there be no improvement beyond add additional card . if you want better gaming , save you dime and buy the better card . Make sure to keep you eye out for GTX 6XX card . at this point , the gtx 680 -lrb- good luck find one -rrb- and 670 -lrb- $ 400 , also good luck find one -rrb- have be release , and I would expect that the 660 will be the horse run at the neck of the hd 7850 . we 'll see .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I originally be saddened very much when I learn how obsolete my old video card be . I upgrade from a ATI Radeon 9800 XT -lrb- AGP interface -rrb- . I think this card be awesome and be disappoint that it be the only thing hold I back from play newer game such as Bioshock . my older card only have pixel shader 2.0 . this be very depressing as I buy the computer use and be not look forward to the option of have to replace the whole system . however I be surprise to see that such a good card come in the agp format . this card be just awesome . it be however extremely long , longer then I have anticipate . if you computer be a small compact thing , this simply will not fit in it . it have a power cord that come with it . its really simple to plug in ; just make sure you power supply can handle the extra strain . also this card do come with DVI port -lrb- 2 -rrb- and s-video -lrb- 1 -rrb- . do not worry though : this card will work with you standard VGA monitor as they include a converter . however to fully appreciate this card , you will get better result with a lcd via DVI connection . this card so far have handle everything I have throw at it with surprising number of fp -lrb- frame per second -rrb- . I be extremely pleased with this card . I be not look forward to have to replace my whole computer just to try and get a pci-e slot . if you know you case have a great amount of space , and you look to take you game to the next level , you should really try this card out . you will be stunned !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	it work ... play my game smooth ... a video card be just another component ... it wont open a beer or jerk chicken .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	exactly what I expect out of this card . amazingness . Works wonder with my new Sabertooth 990x and AMD FX 6-Core : -rrb- . Plays multiple game simultaneously in high def .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I already have a identical card make by another manufacturer -lrb- gigabyte -rrb- . I want to try crossfire with my exist card , just for the hell of it -lrb- I can run most game in ultra setting -rrb- . however , because of how fast these card get sell out on other retailer site and how the manufacturer do not make they anymore , it be nearly impossible until I decide to search it on Amazon . I must say that its availability despite be open box be astonishing . also know how much effort Amazon put in with open box item , I order it without hesitation . I get the item in Amazon 's box , not the manufacturer but this be not a problem . I receive everything from the original box content , include cable , free dirt game , manufacturer driver disc , and the manual . if you be also look for this card for crossfire with you exist 6950\/70 card , I highly recommend it . FYI , this card also have the bio mode 1 and mode 2 switch on the card for you to flash it with 6970 driver , in order to unlock additional shader on the 6950 card . I do not do it on this card as I do try it on my other card previously , but due to heat level and how I do not have a issue with run game revert it back . although the price be pretty much the same as its retail price would go if it be available as a new item online , I do not mind it as it be nearly impossible to find these card . have fun and thanks Amazon .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	run bf3 on Ultra on a 24 '' 1920 x 1200 Dell monitor with 8 gb of ram . this be a very good GPU . also , the GPU fan keep the GPU very very cool . amazing card for the price !
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	I be in the minority here , but my first card run insanely hot , give artifact , and have serious driver issue . the second be not much better . hdmus sound go in and out , could not shake artifact in Skyrim , and it stay in the high 70s to low 80 . the coil whine be also unbearable at speed . overall , it be a massive disappointment . spent week try to work through the issue , and have little success . still , I be go to try a reference card rather than jump ship to Nvidia .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	December 26 , 2011 update -- my wife get I one for Christmas . after my previous experience below , it be exactly what I want . I just try it -lrb- have already load the driver as note below -rrb- . it be work great ! Hmm -- I have another monitor that I could probably use with this computer ... December 11 2011 update -- as indicate below , the purchase be for the church computer . it have be install there and be use successfully in the Worship Service today . it continue to be easy to install and reliable . ORIGINAL -- I install this today . and it work great immediately follow installation . -lrb- 1 -rrb- I make sure that the device be not attach to the computer as note in the guide . -lrb- 2 -rrb- I go to Startech.com and click on download and driver , then enter the device name and dowload the driver . -lrb- 3 -rrb- then I run the driver . -lrb- 4 -rrb- as note in the guide , it eventually indicate that I need to restart so I let the computer restart . -lrb- 5 -rrb- I have the monitor and and cable ready but as note , wait until after the computer restart -- and I give it a few minute so that all application be up and run . -lrb- 6 -rrb- then I plug in the usb cable to the computer -lrb- 7 -rrb- the screen come on immediately . I do go into the system setup as suggest to review and eventually change another monitor so now I have -lrb- a -rrb- laptop screen -lrb- b -rrb- monitor 2 which be connect to the VGA port on the laptop -lrb- c -rrb- monitor 3 which be connect through the USB2VGAE3 each be on and each have different item display . I want to check this out on my computer before we install it on a laptop at church which be use for morning worship presentation -lrb- well it be until we add a new screen which it could not handle -rrb- . so - it be go to be use there . and probably in a month I will be get one for myself . and then probably one for my wife . all in all , if it the new one work as well for I as this one have , I would give it more star than 5 . it be nice to have a product that work well right from the beginning . thanks Startech.com and thanks amazon.com .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	pro : very fast card for the old AGP slot ! Easy to install ! driver on include cdrom work just fine despite what other review have say ! no stability issue to speak of ! cosmetically the card look great ! high stock clock and can be overclocked quite high ! gddr3 memory be the only way to go ! con : card require a powerful power supply of 450 watt 30-amp minimum , I recommend a 500 watt 35-amp or better PSU . card require two Molex 4-pin lead from PSU to function properly . this card be very long and as such will not fit in minus tower , full tower only ! other thought : the bottom line be that they no longer make card for the AGP slot . and if you do not want to throw a bunch of money into build a new system , this be you best bang for buck card to keep that older agp system current to the time . I have a first generation single core AMD 64-bit pc which I soon plan to upgrade to dual core because the new bio on my Asus board support they . when install this card , I have to move my hard drive to a lower slot in the bay because the card be so long it extend to the front of they . I use the driver that be on the include disk , they install fine . I have have no instability issue or driver issue since . and I test this card with fear with all option max out , and all I get to say be WOW ! Time to mop the deck with some hozer online : p consider the 3850 come out not that long ago , you will be pretty current with this card and should keep you system go for a year of more till you next upgrade . I be happy with my purchase !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the StarTech usb to VGA Video adapter work as promise . Easy to hook up and I search to the StarTech.com web site to get the latest software update for enable the adapter . so far it work great and I have no complaint . I would recommend it to other .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	use it to bump up a older dual xeon machine -lrb- 2 x 2.0 ghz 32bit -rrb- . make a world of difference . use it for almost 2 month now with not a problem . I would buy it again if I need another .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	i buy the gtx 670 2670-kr model and last about 2 week . please buy this model -lrb- 2678-kr model -rrb- i do not hear any problem at newegg website review for 2678-kr model . i see the benchmark at youtube and gtx 680 and 670 be almost same performance . but gtx 570 and 580 make a huge difference .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this on the 14th and receive it on the 15th . the card be very good , and have a dual bio switch . shader be unlock easily by just flip the bio switch . the temperature be around 37-38 at idle and max be around 61 degree while play crysis and the witcher 2 on max setting . this card average around 40 fp on very high setting when use Crysis Benchmark . overall , this be a excellent card and I be very satisfied .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I be rating this low not because of the performance of the card but because the active Mini Display Port to DVI adapter be miss . this be the most expensive adapter that be suppose to be include .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	install the card in 6 minute and its work great . Sapphire include everything I need . I be short one power adapter but they supply two , so it work out fine . just run Windows the card be silent . you can not even hear the two fan . I fire up just cause 2 for about 2 hour to try and push it a little and it barely warm up . I run out of time but just run Windows 7 64bit it run at around 35c and the hottest I be able to get just cause 2 to push it be a max of 45c , and even then the fan do not need to speed up much . please note that this be only a day so far that I have it but so far , the improvement over my other card , the hd 4850 1gb be noticeable . the benchmark in just cause 2 be over 75 fp where the 4850 have 25 fp with the setting I choose to test it at . I have the setting turn up with the hd 4850 1gb but now I go to the max with this hd 6950 2gb and it do not even burp once ! awesome . I almost forget ... accord to the reading from techpowerup gpu-z 0.5-5 this new 6950 use less power than the hd 4850 do ! at least with the VDDC sensor log . I 'll have to check the other # 's . needless to say , I be not disappoint . I be very happy so far . I also fire up Assasin 's creed 2 and Bad Company 2 , with both run flawlessly . although I must note that the hd 4850 1gb do also run those two very well , now I can crank up the setting to the max and not lose any performance . I can not wait for battlefield 3 to try this card out on it !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this thing can run just about anything at max setting with little effort . I can run WOW in windowed mode while watch a blue ray on my 2nd monitor and surf the web at max setting and still get 60 + FPS . same go with every game I have throw at it . total overkill for most game but soooo worth it if you love gaming and want to play at the highest setting . now I just need to save up for a 2nd one and set it up in SLI . not sure what I would do with it , but it sure would be cool . -lrb- :
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	I install the card as part of my upgrade . the installation be simple and without issue . the card be not a good card for game playing , but be good for general use , and movie . great price . win 7 performance score be about 4.2 .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	for some reason , I just could not get this to work even after try two of these card and follow all the instruction to the t. I end up get the Gigabyte nVidia GeForce 210 1 gb ddr3 vga\/dvi\/hdmi pci-express Video Card gv-n210d3-1gus . that card work flawlessly and all I do be take the old card out and stick that one in and reboot .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have be run this video card for a few week now with no problem . I be not a big time gamer , but it do everything well that I need it to do .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I would like to give a proper review of this video card so that people know what to expect when they drop over 250 usd on a piece of equipment . First off , let I give you the specification of my system so that you have something to reference : - nzxt Zero 2 full Tower Case - Kentech 950W Power Supply - ASUS M5A88-V EVO Motherboard -lrb- AMD Chipset -rrb- - AMD fx-8150 8-core 3.6 GHz OCed to 4.1 ghz - G. SKILLZ PC14900 RAM 2 x 4gb 1866mhz -lrb- 8 gb total -rrb- - evga gtx 560 ti -lrb- ftw -rrb- 1.25 gb gddr5 320-bit SLI Ready - ASUS Wireless PCI Card - 1tb 7200rpm 64mb Cache SATA 6 gb hard drive - Cooler Master Hyper 212 Heat Sink w \/ twin 120mm 2,000 RPM fan - 8 cooling fan total - asus 24x dvd-burner - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit when I open up the box and take it out , the first thing I notice be how large the card be . obviously , if you plan on use slus then be sure to have a large case with plenty of room . do not use a mid-tower case with this card or you will run into problem . I have a full tower case and still have to make room for it . if you have lot of fan , be sure the wiring be do properly so that you have little trouble install . also , note that you power supply must have at least 4 MOLEX -lrb- 4 pin -rrb- connector free and able to reach near the PCI slot in order to power this thing . this card use lot of power and it be a good idea to make sure you will be able to both fit the card and wire it properly . I use the two 6 pin connector that come off of my power supply since all of my molex connector have fan attach . now let I go over what I think be the biggest problem with this card and what seem to be a issue for some people . once everything be ready to go and you have all the latest driver install , pop the disc they give you into you dvd drive and install the program call eVGA Precision X. this handy program allow you to easily manipulate several aspect of the video card include the speed of the fan , the speed of the memory and the voltage . this be almost a must since this card generate so much heat . the automatic fan control be not great so you will need to utilize this feature in order to get the most out of this card . I test this card with several game , the newest be new Vegas . I max everything out in the nVidia control panel and all the setting in the game menu . I have absolutely no problem with the frame rate and there be no lag at all . my previous video card lag at the highest setting , even with a AMD fx-8150 but this new card work flawlessly . I also test Crysis and Diablo 3 . all work great ... just sit idle this card can run at over 120 degree fahrenheit if you do not manually set the fan speed . if you max it out , it be loud . you will notice it . I usually set it at 70 to 75 % when watch video and max it out when play game at full hd . if you do not have loud speaker then the sound of the fan may interrupt you gaming experience , so be warn . you can maintain a ok temperature at lower speed but to get the most out of you card , try to maximize air flow with additional fan or set it to max rpm when stress it . all in all , this a great choice if you look to save a few buck . it do have some issue with the fan though so if you do not like noisy fan then it be not for you .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	i like this card it be good for gamee like world of warcraf i love it it be also good to have 3 moniter so i can molty task all at the same time
GraphicsCard	POS	4	im not gonna give a huge long technical analysis of this card , but it work great ! i have not hear of visiontek before and be a little leery of try a new brand , but it be the least expensive 7970 available . fortunately my money be not waste , it work spectacularly . i be run a 3 monitor setup with this one card flawlessly . only loss fp rate when run game on all screen , but even that do not effect the performance by much . i can play battlefield 3 on single monitor at 90 + fp easily , and 3 screen at 60 + . so all in all a great buy , i would recommend for anyone who want the true gaming experience
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I just want to say that I do alot of shop around for AGP card . and this one toke the cake . people be always complain about driver , and blue screen . I order this video card one afternoon , recieve it the next . Amazon beat newegg hand down on shipping , when I get the card it be not as huge as everyone keep say , but it be not a small card . plug it in , install the driver -lrb- very easy download from Sapphire -rrb- and voilum , it work like a charm . every game i have try be max out , no lag , over 100fp . mmo like Guild war and WOW be a little less , around 50 fp , but that be server , not this card . if you be look for a great , fast card to keep that agp system kick , this be it . do not let stupid people fool you with driver problem , just make sure you have a big enough PSU and 2 extra 4-pin plug , and you be set . this be the greatest investment for those age machine to keep up with the game of now Pentium 4 3.3 GHZ 1024 MB PC3200 RAM 500GB 7200RPM HDD ATI RADEON 3850HD AGP
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	it work okay but to use it in the manner I intend -lrb- multiple monitor -rrb- , I have to buy a $ 30 adapter for one of the port . the product description do not tell you about that .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	\*\*\* THIS CARD will take 3 slot instead of 2 ! edit - this card be great if you only plan to RUN one card , HOWEVER EVEN ON MY EXTENDED ATX MOTHERBOARD -lrb- I run on the asus iv rampage extreme-z -rrb- two card take up the entire BOARD of 5 slot ! if you run one monitor you will be SET with one card for sure , HOWEVER if you run eyefinity like me , XFIRE be GOING to be a have to THING SOON with unreal engie 4 in ORDER to keep it at OPTIMAL performance and with this card ... XFIRE be NOT possible on most motherboard comfortably which be QUITE IRRITATING to buy only to find you have to sell it in ORDER to get ANOTHER 7970 that size for xfire , just go with a reference card if you plan to XFIRE , you will be MUCH HAPPIER ! I receive this card about a week ago to go with my new upgrade for my desktop . this thing perform like a champ ! the dual bio switch be awesome because bio set 2 `` unlock '' the card to overclock it and if it crash anytime just switch it to bio 1 and you be good to go ! this card be large , but not any larger than the 6870 it replace in my opinion . I would however recommend get 1 card before purchase 2 to make sure you motherboard be big enough to take both card . I run the extended ATX Asus Extreme iv motherboard and I plan to crossfire 2 of they and will still have enough room for one slot for a wifus card or something small . card be amazing all around though and do not regret spend the $ 450 on it for a second , one of these will handle eyefinity at med-high setting which be what I plan to do ! ca not ask for more out of a grahic card !
GraphicsCard	POS	4	buy two at the same time , put one in my hp , and one in wife hp . hers work great and have have no issue yet . mine however like to over heat and turn my computer off , i change driver and have the issue much less , over all real nice product good for gaming .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be faster than most , DirectX 11 ready and require no auxiliary power . it run strictly off the pci-e video slot . under heavy load , it do not exceed room temperature and the fan be whisper quiet . plus , it be dirt cheap . no brainer . buy it .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	con : card itself be severely underpowered . will not play hd movie without stuttering , even with a quad core 3.2 ghz cpu , and 8 gig of ram behind it . do not even think of gaming on this , even on lowest possible setting . will not output to a phillips tv properly over dvi or hdmus . -lrb- this be a issue with some phillip tv and nvidium card in general -rrb- , require a registry change to make it partially work . pro : low price , handle normal window usage very nicely . very low power . this would be great for a person with a low budget that need to replace a dead video card , who only play facebook game , and use they computer for mostly work related stuff -lrb- surf the net , m word , etc -rrb- .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I get this card because a friend buy 2 not realize how big they really be . I be take a star for the fact that it feel completely cheap . I have get a xfx 7970 black edition which feel sturdy and wont even flex when you push it into the slot ; however , this one bend as if I be go to break it put minimal amount of pressure on it . that say though I be impressed !!!! the card be over clock friendly beyond belief , and it be cool as can be . there be a slight whine to it when you have it at 80 % fan speed or above , but its weird cause you can barely hear the fan , just a whine . I have get 65-70 fp at just a slight overclock in bf3 , where the xfx card can only hit a solid 60 . this card will get hot if I put it in the first PCI slot with the xfx below it , which be not surprising . all in all , I be quite worried about all the review claim it ship bust , but be quite happy when it work like a charm ! I get it replace my xfx card until I can get my hand on a beefier power supply but when I do crossfire it with the xfx card I be get a huge improvement over just a single card . I be completely impress with this card , just wish it have a little more of a backbone and be not so cheaply make . I 'll update if thing go wrong but as of now I would be happy to purchase another one of these card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the adapter card be install on a 2004 vintage computer run Windows xp . the video be now of similar quality to a brand new computer .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	my previous video card be a GeForce 8800 gt Alpha Dog Edition . xfx make good on the warranty previously so this be my second 8800 card . when it quit I need a quick replacement and be hopefull the gt 520 would live up to the expectation . I be wrong but could not financially afford a higher quality card at the time . I be still use the gt 520 but will replace it once I can afford . this be no fault of the retailer and I would recommend purchase from they , most definitely !!!!
GraphicsCard	POS	4	the reason I give 4 star be because this item be install in a client computer and after initial installation and testing , I will not have access to further inspection or use . this item ship and arrive faster than expect , install with ease , and once I update the driver from the evga website , it work like a charm on at least 2 high end game on the client machine . although there be no fan on this model , it be very easy to attach one to the exist heatsink -lrb- to help with cooling during game-play -rrb- . I recommend this item for people who be look for a good video card at a good price .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I uprgade my xp to Windows 7 and be in need of a pcus graphic card to provide win 7 feature and DVI output . the Sparkle card satisifed my need , as it provide a DVI output , and have sufficient performance for my need -lrb- I be not as gamer -rrb- .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I be able to adapt my old Dell Dimension 4400 computer to run dual monitor : one for the desk and one for the flat panel above my treadmill so I can watch streaming movie while I work out . it have just enough resolution to run both monitor in native resolution which make they very nice to use , whether for movie watch or productivity . this be one of my great computer stuff buy !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	have to get this GPU when I upgrade to Windows 7 . Works great with window 7 . Color setting be easy and give you plenty of option for most view need . Mine be use primarily as a Media Center PC , so I stream tv , movie to my hd tv . so far no complaint . would definitely recommend this for those who have older motherboard and need agp card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	be stick with a motherboard with a agp video slot , I think I would be stick with 128mb vram forever , or until I shell out the buck for a new board . follow the recommendation of a mmorpg friend , I order this card . after install the hardware and the driver , I immediately load Age of Conan -lrb- which be notorious for laugh at sub-par video card -rrb- , and my jaw drop . the render speed and the detail be amazing . unlike a previous card buy from a third party , this one do not crash every 20 minute . I could not be more pleased . highly recommend .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I get the card in Oct. , 2010 . I do not see the fine print that say to register it to get two year support . recently I start get BSOD -lrb- Blue screen of death -rrb- . in other word , my computer stop and i have to reboot and lose whatever i be work on . this continue for two week . I try uninstall and reinstall driver and software . finally , i disabled the video card . no more bsod . so it be a bad memory on the card . I wish I have register it . that would have mean it be cover now -lrb- for 2 year -rrb- . if you get this card register it . however , I would not recommend that you buy this card . it only last 18 month ! and then cause I no end in grief figure out that the video card be cause my problem and not something else !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	after several day of read review here - I finally go with this card for my older Dell XPS desktop . the Dell AMD install card be just horrible consider XPS be suppose to be they `` better '' gaming type system . I only play wow and web surf . this video card jump my frame per second -lrb- fp -rrb- in WoW way up . in 25-man raid with spell graphic set high , I be maintain 45ish fp and in Stormwind around 80FPS . that be a huge improvement over the original card . one issue I have with this video card that actually make it make a very annoying cycling noise - be the fault of the Dell XPS case . above the card there be a metal crossbar that lock into place over the video card on the motherboard . well due the much larger size of this card compare to the original AMD card - the crossbar when install now compress the new card down to much and cause the annoying noise . after a week of wait to see if the noise would go away on its own - I open the case back up and just remove the crossbar all together . now its perfect - no noise at all ! also as one reviewer say - ensure you power supply have 2 free 6pin power connector - the card will not work with only one . great card overall without break the piggy bank - and if have a older xp system - this be great way to boost its performance and extend you system life .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the first card I receive from Amazon.com have some hardware problem -lrb- as explain by a evga tech -rrb- and I have to RMA . more detail : go to EVGA website to this thread : \/ forums\/tm . aspx ? m = 1644099 and so I tell Amazon I want a RMA Wednesday night ; a new card appear at my doorstep Friday morning . this new card be work great : and I be one very happy camper . ------------------------ now onto the review : pro : power : the evga 670 be a beast . I can run all of my game : include bf3 and my super heavily modded Skyrim max graphic in 1080p . and I average a fp of 70 + sometimes go into 110 fp . EVGA Precision X utility : it be really good . Easy to use , have a lot of neat -lrb- and actually really useful , not just gimmick -rrb- feature : such as test you card , change oc offset , manage fan profile , set target fp . it also have this awesome on screen display : it show the fp , gpu clock , temp , etc. as a overlay on whatever game you be play . it be better than frap . I can go uninstall frap now . : d con : the stock profile with this card run REALLY hot . and when the gpu get too hot -lrb- around 75c -rrb- it start to down clock itself . also , when run on full load -lrb- ex . bf3 on max graphic -rrb- the video card get kind of loud - the fan 's speed get really high . -lrb- edit -rrb- : and yes I know I can tweak the fan setting , and I have : though now its run even louder than before , but at least its not down-clocking . ----------- Final Thoughts : -lrb- my 2 cent -rrb- if this card -lrb- $ 410 -rrb- fit into you budget for a high end computer . get it , the 670 card be a beast . if you want good customer support \/ tech support , good software support -lrb- precisionx -rrb- , and a solid product , go for EVGA . if you want a quieter and cooler card , you might want to go for gigabyte or maybe even Asus\/MSI . obviously , I go for evga -lrb- and I do not regret it -rrb- , but keep you option open .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I upgrade from a 9800gt and now I can finally play skyrim without a problem . this card be pretty big so make sure you have room in you case for it . I have a x79 setup in a hafx-942 case so its a nice addition to the rest of the hardware .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	a friend ask I to upgrade he graphic card for he computer so that he could play game . there be one problem . he computer be a few year old . it only have PCI and AGP slot so I could not get the latest and greatest . I find this one and order it . the installation be a easy and I have no problem . after complete the installation I install call of duty and it work flawlessly .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	i get it like 2 week ago to replace my hd 5870 my 5870 be fine card i have to replace it because my new monitor lead Cinema Display 27 inch which it have only mini display connector and my 5870 do not so this thing crank my new monitor aggressively every thing be on max except the aa in battlefield 3 it cant run on 60 fp and i think everybody know that but when i turn AA off there be no difference my eye can catch but a huge improvement in performance 60 + fp and a massive ultra setting with 2560x1440 high resolution get this card you wont regret it and you may save some good cash and have 10 - fp by get on of those 7950 be just release i would get em if i do not get my new card by the way if i can measure my new 7970 with the 5870 i will say its equal for 3 5870 's in crossfire with 100 % scaling , i would not hesitate to get a new 7970 when i have the buck .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be amazing , i can run any video game ... 70-90FPS Battlefield 3 -lrb- 1360 x 768 , max OUT ULTRA , 4x aa , 16x af , full blur amount and field density ...
GraphicsCard	POS	4	win vista rate the the card a 4.4 on my hp . window aero rate it 4.4 on max quality setting same on the factory default . never try it on performance setting . have say that I really have nothing bad to say about the card , my game look great and I can even run game that say I need a bit more process power . for the price it be the best buy for a computer part I ever make .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Easy install and great price make this a good buy . be Windows , Linux and Unbunto compatible . I run a dual boot with unbunto and winxpro3 and it install flawless . Unbunto surprise I by install it with driver and no cd be even need . I wish more review list what people use so I include that in my review . my system be a HP 2.6 quadcore 2gb ram and the 1gb videocard . Plays movie flawless and editing as other have mention be great . I upgrade from a Nvidia 9500 -lrb- not gt -rrb- and its night and day for the use . gaming , I can not review as I use Xbox and no need for pc gaming . the card be a plain-jane , no frill look like a video card nothing fancy with minus fan . funny the box it come in have more flare , but that advertising for you . for $ 50.00 you can not go wrong for those want a gaming card , I suggest look at higher end card . at $ 50.00 I be wonder what other expect in the way of gaming ? we family do have a AlienWare pc with a 8 gb video card , now that for gaming . and cost nearly $ 400.00 anyway you get what you pay for and its a 3000.00 pc for a basic all around performer this card seem good . I would buy again , temperature seem fine however would be nice if the fan be power through and cable and not the slot . Update : I recently in June 2012 upgrade to Win7 Ultimate , the card seem to work really well on this os too . no problem of any kid , the card have not fail or error-ed . one thing I be not aware at purchase be in win7 the 3d option come on allow you to view 3d movie with 3d setting if you have glass . another nice perk about this card I do not know be it work on just about any m base OS . good card great price .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	the video card install without any problem . I update driver to 12.4 and all seem great . card run cool and quiet . the problem start when I be use my browser . I would get screen flicker . this be not a issue in game that I could see . if I alt tab out of game to browse the flicker be much worse . I try all kind of fix with no luck . I decide to return the card and go with Asus instead .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this two of these card as a upgrade from a 2x5750 atus card setup . I be quite impressed at price\/performance ratio of these card . a couple of note , the card be extremely long , make sure that you can fit the card in you motherboard before you attempt to jamalama the card into the drive . in addition , these card do not come with the Crossfire connector - you must buy it separately - it do not say it be include , so it be not . the card be reasonably quiet , and can be overclocked fairly easily with the standard atus software .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	hello folk , I pop in modern game like Operation Flashpoint - Dragon rise , which ask for a dual core . I have a single core 2.8 GHz Pentium IV . the game work great ! I will guess it be because of this great video card . my pc be something like nine year old ! the graphic card keep extend the life of my old bessy ! LOL Marc
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I be very excited switching from my previous sapphire 4870 to this new model , and at first very happy with the performance , huge gap as you can imagine . trouble start a few hour after with a first freeze while play , I start to wonder about my computer , test everything , remove some harddrive , RAM module -lrb- testing with mem86 -rrb- wipe and re-install driver , swithe from one pcie to another , nothing would do , I be still get random freeze , mostly while play but also on the desktop , also I would see display corruption come back from sleep mode . intersting point it happen really random , I try to stress my system with free software out there use all GPU ressource and even CPU and MEM ressource at the same time , no luck , unable to `` trigger '' the freeze ... switch back to my previous card , magic ! no more issue ... -lrb- switch several time between the two card , same symptom -rrb- therefore I have no doubt the problem come from the card -lrb- or some kind of incompatibility with my system -rrb- after a few day search for my problem on the internet I find a interesting topic talk about issue while dual screening -lrb- my case -rrb- more precisely while dual screening DVI + HDMI -lrb- my case -rrb- , I think great ! I find my problem , but sadly ... still no luck and still problem even with one screen . at this point I be wait for my rma number to return the card , I fear I may have the same problem with the new one if it be link to my hardware -lrb- x58 platform win7 64 bit -rrb- I do not know , but this be the first time I be have this kind of issue and I be quite upset with sapphire .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I be not sure how to review this product in term of its spec . so I will just mention my experience with it in ply Skyrim . when you be on the highest setting , the game might stutter from time to time . but after lower several setting -lrb- e.g. shadow detail to medium -rrb- , the game run flawlessly -lrb- even with the skyrim hd mod -rrb- .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	let I start out with a forward by say the card be a beast ! I upgrade from a mid-range 9800gt to this thing and get dx11 support , thrice the graphic process power , and a card that can run everything I can throw at it at 40fps or above . I do not really fancy the Dirt 3 that much , but hey , a free game be a free game . if you be into GPGPU application then this one be definitely a home-run hitter with its 2tflop compute power . mining bitcoin yield 250mh , although it falter when GPU render in Sony Vegas . however , the card be rather large . in fact , I have to rearrange some cable just to get it to fit in my case . regard actual performance ; while AMD be gain market share , the majority of game be seemingly develop for Nvidia . in fact , Deus ex Human Revolution , a game that be once often gifted with AMD card , suffer from periodic slowdown , even with this beastly card . the slowdown be not limit to this game , however , and be exacerbate by record with frap . also , the driver for AMD -lrb- namesake `` catalyst '' -rrb- be also notoriously inferior to Nvidia 's . the change be not aptly document enough , and I have yet to find how to maintain my image aspect ratio in game -lrb- all the information I find on Google be for driver at least 3 version earlier -rrb- . the molex to 6 pin adapter that come with it appear flimsy at first , you have to force the connector in a bit until it slip in . if either connector be not plug in you 'll get the fan run at jet engine speed and no display , although you usb device will be work fine . also , I would not count on that rebate . just assume it be money lose .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the video card be incredible the graphic be wonderful . the card be gorgeous , and seem very well build . I could not believe the detail in Cyris 2 , and Max Payne 3 run the game perfect with no issue . the only problem be I do not know that you need at least 500 watt power supply to run this graphic card . if you have say a 250 like I do the card will not work . also the card get hot so I get new computer shell with better vent , and 600 watt power supply . other then that get one asap , you will not be sorry buying this wonderful gamer 's dream card . I almost forget to mention the first card send by amazon seem to have be a use one not the same card I believe , however amazon be nice enough to refund my money , and let I send back the wrong card at they expense .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	this card run well as long as it be work properly . I replace my old Radeon 4890 power-color edition and there be a slight improvement from that when it come to run particular graphic enhancement in game . I mainly buy it so I would have dx11 since my old card do not . this be the second 6870 I have have to get , the first one be DOA , Amazon let I swap it for a new one . and after 2 month the card start have major graphical issue , random color pixel on the desktop , game be not even playable . I try the ` baking method ' as a last ditch effort to salvage the thing , this do not improve or worsen the card . I find it hard to believe I get two lemon one right after the other . I have contact Sapphire and in the process of return it for a replacement . I have already buy a new Nvidia EVGA GTX 560tus 448 Core Classified and it be run soundly .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	great video card , best out there at the moment . as well as receive great online rating -lrb- there be 2 that be better I think 580 and one other but the performance difference be so little and the price be double -rrb- . I get it so I can play video game at high resolution and stream they life online . the FPS go from 15 to 50 + with this card ! just a advice , if you do not know this already - get a power supply 600 watt be perfect . some people say 750 or 1k but 600 be more than enough why use more electricity when you do not need it . I get this one :  ocz ModXStream pro 600W Modular High Performance Power Supply compatible with Intel Sandy Bridge Core i3 i5 i7 and AMD Phenom
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	after see the tempting rebate-based price of $ 245 , I order a pair of these card . I be attract by they better price\/performance over Nvidias and they be also repute to run cooler . I also want to experiment with multiple monitor which the AMD eyefinity system appear to do much better than they competition . I be await the delivery of a dp port adapter before I can try this and may update this review later with the result . I be find these dual-fan 6950 be actually run about 20 degree -lrb- c -rrb- hotter when install in the same slot as my pair of single-fan Nvidia 460s . another attraction of these card be the dual bio which allow upgrade they to the spec of the AMD 6970 card but I can not attempt this while temperature be run high . in theory , anything up to 90c be ok but I experience a complete shutdown of the graphic card at around 80c -lrb- cpu continue to run fine -rrb- . the other difficulty I experience be that the spec list a Crossfire bridge as be include with each of the card -lrb- necessary to run two card link together -rrb- but neither card have the promise bridge and I have to find one locally in lieu of wait for day to get replacement . these card definitely perform better than the Nvidias they replace and I can now run bf3 smoothly in Ultra setting at 50 fp or I can run in high at 70 to 80 fp on my 120hz monitor . not too surprisingly , the rebate process seem design to discourage one from actually claim the rebate . first , nothing be say in the Amazon ad about the rebate be limit to one per household so half of my expect rebate be go the moment I try to apply . just find the rebate form on the Amazon site be quite a chore and then I be inform a copy of the invoice would be require . Amazon only send a miniaturize version of the invoice now which turn out to be a tiny scrap of paper about3x4 inch which have be tear off so that the invoice number be not readable . try to go online to find the invoice number be a ordeal of multiple menu that be not at all intuitive -lrb- I be a former software designer and this be one of my pet peeve -rrb- . I finally find where I could order a printout of recent order but after the report be complete , I receive a email that I could access it by go back to my Account on the Amazon site . old invoice use to pop right up but now view they involve open email , download a comma-delimited file , save it , and open it with a appropriate program -lrb- I do not have Excel -rrb- . and then you still have to print out the invoice copy , chisel the barcode off the box , stuff everything into a envelope and mail it off while hope you have not overlook some tiny detail that will be a pretext for refuse the rebate . I finally conclude that the $ 20 rebate process -lrb- already down from the expect $ 40 -rrb- be not even go to return minimum wage for my time and I move on to more important thing . I advise not be take in by promise rebate . they be too time-consuming to claim and too often in the past I have have they later reject on some tiny technicality . rebate go out of vogue for a while because they be cause too much ill-will for manufacturer but now they be creep back in we depressed economy . I have be burn in the past by they so shame on I for allow it to happen again .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	the packaging for this say that it be Windows xp compatible . but it be not ! no driver exist anywhere that will run this card on xp . the installation cd even say `` Windows xp '' on the label . but when you try to install the driver , you get the error message `` driver be not compatible with this os '' . ASUS usually do well with they driver , support , and documentation , which be the main reason I choose this product . but they really drop the ball this time . this may be a great graphic card for Windows 7 or Vista , but I will never find out . I be return it to Amazon tomorrow .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I purchase this card for my old pc . I need to be able to output the pc video signal to my plasma tv , and this card do the trick really well . I particularly like all additional setting that allow you to squeeze out every single bit of usable pixel information on you tv screen - resolution , stretch , color depth , position adjustment , etc. . installation be very smooth and as easy as 1-2-3 . overall , it be a really nice product I be very happy with , I would definitely recommend it to anyone .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have a nVidia Geforce 8600g -lrb- pcie x16 -rrb- with two 27 '' monitor -lrb- Dell and Samsung -rrb- . I want to add three more 19 '' monitor but do not have any additional pcie slot . these Sparkle 8400 be a good alternative . I pop they in and add the three 19 '' monitor on the 8400 . they be slower for thing like re-sizing window and Netflix video playback , but since I be only use they as secondary monitor , it be fine . no compatibility issue as all video card be use the same geforce driver .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	good card , do what you would expect at a good price . plug in card , load driver -lrb- insert cd into CD drive and follow simple instruction -rrb- , work flawlessly without problem . later get automatic notification of newer driver update that be as easy to update as click on the `` install '' button . recommend purchase by desktop support it professional .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	arrive without a guide or documentation of any sort , inside or out , opposite of encouraging review by mr b above that specifically mention a guide . -lrb- ? be this a return ? ? OEM ? be not list as such . ? do the vendor even look in the box ? -rrb- driver installation exit with hopeless message . nVidia knowledgebase have only trouble report , no on-line guide . resort to live Chat , get lead around the barn a few time by someone work out of a script notebook . finally quit chat and figure it out myself . not a newbie . what must they go through ?
GraphicsCard	POS	5	my evga nVidia GeForce 7800 GTX 512 , once a oem-only benchmark smoking $ 750 + -lrb- in 2005 dollar : -rrb- -rrb- graphic card , have finally reach the point where new game be not playable at all , and new , entry-level card be begin to outrun it . it be only take 6 year . : d if you be look at this product , you be likely aware that the only thing it share with the gtx560 ti be the name . the rest of the hardware be a 570 with one additional multiprocessor disabled -lrb- possibly 570 chip with a core that do not pass muster -rrb- . great review of the underlie hardware be available from all the normal hardware testing site , so I 'll focus on the evga and classify portion of this card . I have deal with evga hardware personally and professionally for go on six year now , and can find nothing bad to say about the company . which be remarkable , come from I . you get the feeling , own they product , that they make the kind of product they themselves would like to own . they stand behind they hardware , offer awesome warranty -lrb- 5 , 10 or lifetime , depend on the hardware -rrb- and provide all the overclocking and monitoring tool you need . the classify card be large ; it take up all of the available space in my Alienware full tower between the drive cage and the PCI case slot . so much so , in fact , that I have to remove my ide cable for lack of a place to run it , and both card have to be insert at a angle , line up with the DVI port and rotate into place . seat and slot , there be just enough room for a SATA cable to lay between the drive cage and the end of the card . I install the card in my evga x58 slus 3x motherboard , pull out my 7800 . though the card instruction recommend installation in the 1st and 3rd pcie slot , I want dual-slot x16 bandwidth , not some hobble x16\/x8 monkey business . know better , naturally , I place then in the first two x16 slot . the fan side of these card , with the red stripe , be bow out , and when they be place in the adjacent slot , I find that they actually push on each other , cause a awkward sort of lean in the plastic bezel . but they work . so I fire up my system . installation of the driver be unremarkable , a couple of reboot later I be up and run . the problem I immediately notice be bring to light by evga 's own precision software . at idle -lrb- as idle as Aero get , at least -rrb- gpu2 be sit at a comfortable 37c , while gpu1 sweat up around 50c . launch a game with slus bring the temperature up . the cooling system in the card will rev the fan up to keep the temperature from exceed 70C , and gpu2 hit that . gpu1 go much farther than that . I consider water-boiling temperature to be too high for my comfort . play a older game like tf2 do not cause a problem , other than my concern that one card be 30C hotter than the other . run a directx11 demo program with tessellation utilize the card fully , however , and my system soon reboot itself . after the second reboot in two day , that little nagging `` install in x16 slot 1 and 3 '' keep come up in my mind , and so I do a little research about the impact of x16\/x16 versus x16\/x8 . I find that the expert note only a performance different of 5-6 fp in most game -lrb- and we be not run below 60 -rrb- . the SLI bridge make up a lot of the difference , it appear . so I move gpu2 to the third x16 slot and now both card stay about the same temperature all of the time , I have have no problem play game . with the notable exception that my mouse-tracking in some game have improve so much that I have to adjust my fp habit to compensate for the change . so the classify card be huge , they need a lot of juice -lrb- 6 pin and 8 pin on each -rrb- and I see no possible way to actually run three of these in slus without replace the heatsink with a waterblock to get rid of the heat . that be say , they be build for overclocking , and for the price of one of these card , you can speed it up to compete easily with much more expensive choice . and the evga logo on the edge of the card light up white . shame on evga for not print in they installation manual : `` no , stupid , I say use the 1st and 3rd slot . I do not care what you think you know about bandwidth as it apply to SLI , do what I say before you burn you house down . '' I be hope for another 6 year with this next generation of evga graphic card .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	product come in with all part and cable . install be easy . Monitor come alive as soon as I turn it on . upgrade from a 128mb card and what a difference . brought new life to my old Dell desktop . price be fair . I can now watch show on CBS.com in full screen and no lag when it hit hd broadcast . Play facebook game with no problem . only bad thing be that it would not upload new driver from disk that it come with . Got latest driver online .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	do not get I wrong this card be really awesome specially for the price , I have not OC ` ed mine -lrb- beyond the Saphire OC -rrb- as there be no need to for pretty much any game at 1920 x 1080 resolution , but this card have a great OC potential if you be into that . however it feel like some driver would really unleash the potential , ccc 12.6 beta be say to improve performance for the 7XXX series and it do improve it ! .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	I have be use this adapter for about a week now and it be work , but it chew up most of my 4gb of RAM . I be go to upgrade to 8gb to see if that fix the lagging problem I be experience right now . unfortunately , I be use it for a trading set up off my laptop and I literally can not afford to have any lag time or slowness . my trading platform keep bang up against max memory available . I 'll update after I upgrade RAM to see if performance improve . if you have a more static need for a additional monitor , I would say this would not be a problem , but for a trader , this cost effective solution could be a very costly one indeed .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	great card for the money !! go in easy and very quiet . as to the dirt3 retrieval and activation process , it be about the same degree of difficulty as find a honest politician . endless crapware to download and then login\/logout\/product id 's \/ unique id 's \/ coupon codes\/re-register\/go here\/go there - yadayada then have the process deadend in nowhereville . design to frustrate as many as possible . I assume most will not make it accross the moat . update 12\/26\/11 - after several hour of dload on boradband I finally get to install the game on 12\/19\/2011 . when I go to play it on 12\/26\/2011 - it want to `` update '' for another 3 hour . rediculous . why not give out the right download the first time around ? like I say , big waste of time - free game ... right . card be still great - justy forget about the game stuff .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	I recently come upon a nice server with pci-x slot , but no pci-e slot . although easy to confuse the two by name , they be not interchangeable . this pcus revision 2.1 fit perfectly into a pci-x slot to upgrade my Intel server to Windows 7 compatiblity with Aero-View . the onboard video be not design for home entertainment and barely have a 1.0 Windows experience index , but with this board the index come up to 2.5 , and Windows turn on Aero-View after the rating be update .  evga geforce 6200 512 mb ddr2 pcus 2.1 VGA\/DVI-I\/S-Video Graphics Card , 512-p1-n402-lr

I can now play my video game -lrb- doom 3 , cod 2 , Kotor I and II , F.E.A.R. , nwn with full graphic detail . this with Windows 7 - the property on the card show 512 meg dedicate video ram , with 763 share ram , make this a over 1 gb ram video card . I love it , and highly recommend .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video adapter be great for add a 2nd\/3rd display to you laptop . the refresh rate be not great , but its more that adequate for business application . it even work well enought for video chat . overall , I have be very happy with the device . it also come with a helpful app that allow you to move the screen a window be display on by hit ctrl + screen # -lrb- something Windows 7 should provide out of the box -rrb- .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I need a good card to upgrade my Dell so I could play some of the newer game . I be not interesting in pay a whole lot for it and when I check out this card , I note the number of people who say it be a good card . I have a Geforce 6200 with 256 of RAM I bring for a Compaq SSF Evo 510 and it work out great . this card prove to be worth every penney of what I spend on it . installation be easy and the the software installation be easy too . the extra video RAM help my 2.8 gig p4 a lot and be much better than the on board video . for the price , this card perform very well . one could spend more and get a better card , but for what I need it for it be perfect ! good card !!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	very happy with this graphic card . ive bean excite to buy this thing and im happy i finally do also im glad i buy this over the XFX one . the XFX card be annoying and the sound resemble a hair dryer . when use this card my case fan and hard drive be actually louder . i love this card so much and i recommend it to all . the performance be great and do not draw as much power as i think . be aware if you have a matx board that you may block a few sata port . but not a big deal , one more note the card be beautiful also do not get a dirt 3 code but that not a problem i do not but the card for the game . hope you all enjoy the card as much as i be .
