Keyboard	NEU	3	no problem pair with laptop run on Windows Vista . curved ergonomic keypad be really comfortable for long use , and the individual key layout be friendlier than full size wave keyboard . the battery life seem to be reasonable , no replacement so far after 1 month usage . take about 3-5 seconds to wake up from battery saving mode . ca not tell if Cap Lock or Num Lock be on or off ; a status indication led at the keyboard would be helpful . this can become irritating , especially typing a password text box . chassis for the keyboard could use stiffer plastic material , feel too fragile ; I doubt this keyboard can last long .
Keyboard	POS	4	only 4 start because it do not have a usb hub . that be absolutely the only down side . I love it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I love this keyboard ! this be , in fact , the second of this model of keyboard I have purchase -lrb- for different computer , the first keyboard be still in use -rrb- . I highly recommend to anyone to get one of these keyboard for themselves !! : -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	4	I really like my keyboard protector that I order . the color be amazing and it feel cool to type on . also , if you be prone to spilling crumb near you computer or anything that could be potentially harmful to you keyboard , I would highly recommend get a keyboard cover . it keep you keyboard protect and you keyboard do not get all dusty . it be very easy to put on and take off . the color of my keyboard protector match my case\/shell . love it !!
Keyboard	NEU	3	first I 'll admit I might be older than the usual person use to thumb typing everything ... I be not a huge texter , and when I email on my smart phone , I often make it short or use voice recognition ... so that be say , the keyboard be pretty good mechanically in that the button click nicely -lrb- so you know you have hit it a button -rrb- ... it be a qwerty layout , so good enough . . if you be use to thumbtype this be probably awesome ... there be a backlight which help see in the dark room ... there be a big mouse pad . . all good so far ... and it be small so it do not add significantly to the `` pile of remote '' . . however , my main issue be that I find the mouse pad not very responsive or sometimes to responsive . . its way too easy to ` double click '' and select a link as you try to slide over it . because it be a small area , you have no choice but to pick up you thumb and move it back onto the pad sometimes and this can be interpret as a `` click '' ... Everytime I find myself log in to a website , I find myself think `` gee , I should really just put a wireless keyboard and mouse here '' , and I may just do that ... but once all you site be log into , and you get the mouse speed across the screen good , this be probably a good thing . . and I mainly use the laser pointer to freak out the dog and the neighbor cat , but I could image it would be useful for presentation -lrb- again if you be good at thumb typing -rrb- . . but that be the design of this unit so I can not really make that a detraction . . if you want a full size keyboard , get a full size keyboard ...
Keyboard	POS	4	this be by far one of the coolest look keyboard around . it be incredibly thin , make of a sleek glossy black plastic and brush aluminum -lrb- which as someone else mention can get cold -rrb- . the keyboard have a solid , well construct feel and the keystroke be outstanding . I personally love my ThinkPad keyboard and this keyboard remind I of exactly that . the keystroke be precise but not as far -lrb- deep -rrb- as with a standard keyboard . the keyboard do have some drawback . first , I really wish there be a contextual menu key . that really bother I , because I constantly need to use the mouse instead . on the left side of the keyboard there be five button , `` sleep '' , `` zoom in '' , `` zoom out '' , `` default zoom -lrb- back to 100 % -rrb- '' , and a arrow button , which be strange as it be a left click arrow . I do not really use it and do not know why it be there . you can not change these key . the right side have a media key , which can be limitedly customize -lrb- i.e. only select media software -rrb- , a bar to adjust volume , a mute button , and a circular touch disk , and leave and right mouse button . the volume strip work fine , and I do wish that the touch disk be a bit bigger . I do like the fact that it be a disc , because you can scroll like a ipod by move you finger around the disc . it could be a bit better as far as sensitivity be concern . you can customize some of the f key , the other feature light up when you push the `` fn '' key which be located where you would expect a contextual menu key . I do not use these key all that much . cool that you can recharge it in the include stand . you do need a area of free desk space to `` show off '' you keyboard in the charger though . you can not have anything around it because the keyboard go all the way to the bottom of the charger when it be in its base -lrb- so that the keyboard be almost touch the desk -rrb- . battery life be really good . overall I would recommend this keyboard .
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy this baby after hear about the wonder of a mechanical keyboard , and there simply be no word that can explain how much better they feel than traditional one . the wonderful clicky sound you get when you press a key , the feeling of it on you finger . Use one for a day and then try to type on a regular keyboard , it will feel mushy and give you a stomach ache . this model be wonderful for anyone who do a lot of typing and gaming . they keyboard be heavy , so it do not slide around , and the easy to press clicky key will increase you wpm -lrb- or APM for you fellow Starcraft 2 nerd -rrb- . the lack of label force you to memorize the key , and as someone who use to look down every now and then for a symbol or two , I can honestly say this make you a much better typist . -lrb- plus it look cool as hell -rrb- . the only complaint I can possibly give this keyboard be its usb hub . the keyboard have 2 usb plug , one for the actual keyboard , and one that power 2 usb 2.0 slot on the right side of the keyboard . the problem be if you plug anything with a reasonably big usb plug into the slot , they get into you mouse area . other than that , I can not recommend this keyboard enough . if you be still typing on a regular keyboard , do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a mechanical , and you might as well fork over the money for the best .
Keyboard	POS	5	this be great ! Easy to setup\/connect , nice to look at . protective case . I test it out on a couple of email and note . still play with all the different function key . so far so good !
Keyboard	NEU	3	you get a excellent mouse with a decent keyboard . consider the price of the mouse itself , this be a great value . however , I be not impress with the quality of the keyboard . the key feel cheap , and the action be unimpressive . for my taste , the keyboard be much too `` soft '' and feel flimsy . the optical mouse , however , be a must-have item . the precision of a optical laser be fantastic , and microsoft really do make the best optical mouse out there -lrb- although other be cheaper -rrb- . the scroll wheel be extremeley useful , and the mouse feel great in you hand . if you need a keyboard and a mouse , this combo be a good value . but if you already have a acceptable keyboard , I would recommend buy the mouse alone .
Keyboard	NEG	1	these guy post a false picture of a illuminated black keyboard , that be very flexible and portable . what they send I be this crappy generic keyboard that have a very bad rubber material , that be not illuminate , and be a ugly gray color . the key dont even work correctly , you have to literally smash they to get they to enter . this be a waste of $ 20.00 . I even find the same generic keyboard on a website for only $ 5.00 . this be a rip off ! and yes , I be go to return it beware of this seller , and he cheap item .
Keyboard	NEU	3	good material but i be think the character it be come light like the key board but the color be black so there no light come up to you so you will do not benefit from the light !! so u can take the transparent one
Keyboard	POS	5	this keyboard work great right of the box , and most importantly , all the key be full size and in the right place . love that it have a off switch , since it be only use intermittently .
Keyboard	POS	5	I order this product since it be only about 3 dollar , and have free shipping . . much better than some other site that want 30 dollar for the same product . the color be a bit off from the picture , but I like it so much better !! it be a very pretty pink , and go well with the cover I have on my laptop . it fit great , but I have a 15 '' macbook pro , not a 13 '' . . so , maybe there be a bit more room for the product . I would definitely recommend get this product !! : d
Keyboard	NEG	1	I read the direction . it do not work . I love the cover though . the connect cord seem use and it look dirty .
Keyboard	POS	5	i have a 13inch macbook pro and i purchase this to protect the keyboard , i fear that it be go to be cheaply make but let I just say it be not ! its thin and fit perfectly over the key , it do not come up around the edge , and it feel more comfortable for my hand anyways since I be on the computer for extended period of time , definitely recommend , you can not go wrong for the price !!!
Keyboard	POS	5	this little unit be a cracker . I be use it in my media room for which be be perfect . the key be a bit small , but that be really the point , with the unit be similar or smaller in size than the other remote . the self light keyboard be excellent , allow for the key to be see in the darkened room . I can absolutely recommend this anyone with a media pc .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be very satisfied with this keyboard it be nice and it be get gentle key . this do not come with a manual so if you try to figure out how to change the backlight color , it right next to the dial knob . this keyboard also do not look tacky as I thougth it would be . it be just perfect and I think it be worth the price . you will not be disappoint with this one .
Keyboard	NEU	3	the cordless portion of this product set work fine most of the time although there have be a couple time I have to resynch it .  the keyboard be rather clicky and annoying if you have to listen to someone else typing on it . it feel okay if you be typing on it yourself .  I do not use the mouse anymore . I use a Logitech wireless trackball -lrb- which I love -rrb- . a nice thing be that I could the they trackball with the keyboard\/mouse receiver without add a second receiver .  the add control button be nice . I like the volume control wheel better than + \/ - button for volume .  I think I would like the left hand wheel but in reality , I almost never use it .  overall , its fine but I be not thrill with it . I probably would not buy it again but do not mind have it around .
Keyboard	POS	5	within a week of have this keyboard ive already spill water and meat on it and it get inside the key . you would never know . the key arent sticking and everything be work perfect . the keyboard be amazing , i have not learn how to use all the entensive feature but what i have so far be amazing . another mentionable thing be that most people complain of the palm wrest say it be useless , i find it very suitable personally . yes it be hard plastic but i dont put all my wait on it , i more use it as a elbow rest and i use it to lightly wrest my wrist on it to take some pressure off my finger while typing for extensive period of time . i think it be comfortable , you may believe different though .
Keyboard	NEG	2	this thing be a nightmare . it choose when it want to work . it be fantastic when it do work , I love the key and the shape of the mouse , but it only decide to work when it want to . there have be so many time where I have almost replace it , and then it will work for a while , then make I want to break it in half again . Trust I just spend the extra 10-20 dollar for a more reliable brand .
Keyboard	POS	5	I enjoy this keyboard thoroughly ; the backlight be really fun in the dark and the color can even cycle through three preset color use m1 , m2 , and m3 . I would definitely recommend it . I look at the g19 as well and to I the full color lcd screen be not worth it , and so far I be not regret my decision at all by save a good bit of money and go with this g510 .
Keyboard	NEG	1	key start fail after about 2 month , and some of the key marking rub off too . not recommend .
Keyboard	POS	5	consider my wrist start hurt so bad that I could not move they that too at 26 year of age and 3 year of be a consultant I realize I need to take action and stop typing on the laptop keyboard and get a comfortable keyboard . the wrist pain have not yet all go away -lrb- the keyboard be not a healer -rrb- but my hand feel much more relax . good value for money
Keyboard	NEU	3	it seem to function find but if you pick it up by the wrist rest attachment it be likely to fall apart and possibly crash to the ground . this be particularly upset since it be wireless which enable you the option of move the keyboard out of the way .
Keyboard	NEG	1	it be a very nice keyboard but some of the key dont work right . the company be great as far as give I another one but this one have problem too . I do not want to be a bother so I have not say anything about the replacement be mess up too .
Keyboard	NEG	2	it take a lot of time get use to typing wit this cover , and be not very comfortable . I have hear that there be ventilation issue use this . if I be you , I would purchase a keyboard wipe -lrb- or chamoix -rrb- and avoid use this .
Keyboard	POS	5	this be a awesome deal at $ 99.00 . basically turn you tv into a internet surfing device . Google Chrome be on there and I use it more there than on any other computer at home . Netflix work great , Pandora and Internet video podcast queueing . I subscribe to a number of video podcast and it be great to watch they in hd right from the device . I hear lot of complaint about hook it up and get start , but it be easier than my last Bluray player .
Keyboard	POS	5	very please to the eye and very responsive . only negative thus far installaton cd be not include as state , not sure why . Got sofrware and latest driver off site and everything go well without a hitch . key be rather large and to my liking , the lead light have 2 brightness level and the choice for none which be nice . very pleased , would definitely recommend !
Keyboard	POS	5	Ok , at first I could not get this to work . when I copy the driver over to the phone and when I finally find a app call `` appinstaller '' I be able to install this app . well I get that far think this be not that bad . wrong . it will not activate ... then I read a review from someone here on amazon in this thread . anyway , this be what I do . I when to setting , wireless and network . turn on my bluetooth with a check . go into Bluetooth setting . scan for device and there it be . I tap the Micro Keyboard that be find and enter `` 0000 '' and tap ok . then I go to my keyboard and enter `` 0000 '' and enter . can you believe ? it work the device say connect to hide . think there may be more to what I do to get this to work because I do install another free app call `` BlueInput '' for hid that be still on my phone . if you have trouble play with this app then go back to what I say above . sorry for all these crazy instruction . Quickoffice work great and I love this keyboard . I read some of the other review on the f key and think that be good info . if you want contact I I be all ear . it work great on my Droid X. that be cool the touch pad work great as do the directional key in quick office . this be so cool . have a great day ...
Keyboard	POS	5	this work great with linux and 7 with no driver install . you can conserve battery life by turn off the remote portion when you do not need it . the usb transceiver be impressively small . you can turn the mousepad action sideways if you like . the keyboard will illuminate on demand . its the perfect solution for the home entertainment box run Netflix . could not ask for more .
Keyboard	POS	4	the key board cover be really nice and easy to use . you just place it over you key - it keep dust and dirty stuff from get all over you key . I bring this because I have really oily finger and I do not like the oil mark on that be leave by key on the screen . this key board cover for I reduce the oil mark on the screen . my friend be use my laptop and he be like do something weird happen to you key , they feel different ? he do not even know there be a cover ! Thats how nice the cover be . I recommend this type of cover not the color one because they be more professional and the light still glow nicely . on the f5 and f6 button there be just the f5 and f6 symbol not the symbol to make you key light up or down . all the other button be the same as you key board . now that I have the cover I barely use the key light except when im in the dark . the feel be really soft and a little higher than you might be use to but you will get use to it because its a small difference . oh and the key do not make that much noise with the cover when you typing very fast . this could be useful in a meeting or a class . I be really happy I buy it . it be not too much either
Keyboard	NEG	2	i now know why this be only $ 2.54 . the rubber use trap and catch dust very easily . i intend to use this for my new macbook air , but this be obviously make for the older generation pro because the keyboard backlight barely show through , the cap lock light do not show through at all , and the top right button have a eject button instead of a power button . it fit perfectly fine , but make typing less enjoyable - i do not like the feeling of the rubber and like i say before , it catch dust a lot . bottom line : if you be on a budget , this product will do the trick , but it be very much the `` bare-bones '' of keyboard cover . it be also probably better suit for macbook pro
Keyboard	POS	5	buy a new Macbook for my daughter go off to college . assume there be go to be a lot of wear and tear so wanted to protect it as much as possible . could not be happier . the installation be a breeze . about 8 seconds to figure out which way to align the bottom , then snap into place . the top be equally as easy . about 5 seconds to snap in place . receive it within 2 day . Amazon never fail to please I !
Keyboard	NEG	1	after have this keyboard include with my tablet pc , I start use it regularly in the office for the past couple of week -lrb- do not use keyboard much first couple week -rrb- but be have intermittent issue with the connectivity\/syncing , not to mention the lag mention in previous review when it do work -lrb- I could have live with that though -rrb- . I would get 1-3 day of functionality before it would just stop work ... I think it be a computer\/software\/windows 7 issue so i would uninstall and re-install and it would work again for 1-3 day -lrb- 1.5 day be the average and yes i change the battery too -rrb- and after a excruciatingly long wait time with asus to get resolution -lrb- that be another review ... -rrb- they say `` we 'll send a email with return instruction '' ... the email never come ... and the keyboard finally stop work altogether -lrb- computer could no longer discover -rrb- when I call back they say the Microsoft 6000 keyboard be not cover in the warranty - it be one week past 30 day coverage ... never again for the MSFT keyboard or ASUS for that matter ... poor product poor customer service .
Keyboard	POS	4	I use this with a pc plug into the tv . sit on the couch from across the room , the wireless aspect work great . here be a few thing I really like about the keyboard : the trackball be easy to use the `` mouse '' button for the trackball be well positioned and have several option . there be a handy left-click button on the edge of the keyboard just under the trackball . it be very well position for how I hold the keyboard . likewise the scroll wheel on the left edge of the keyboard be in the perfect place to use it . and there be two other left\/right mouse button on the main keyboard surface . the keyboard be a nice small size but will full size key . more equivalent to a large laptop keyboard than a desktop keyboard . I do not want a big keyboard sit by my tv and this fit just right . the only downside I have see be : there be no indicator light -lrb- numlock \/ cap lock -rrb- on the keyboard . that be a real problem when log in . I understand they probably omit the light as a battery power save feature but I really think they be necessary . really minor here : the wireless receiver dongle be larger than I would like . it be stick out of a front usb port on my pc and I would really appreciate a smaller receiver so there be less chance it could get bump and break .
Keyboard	POS	5	I think those ergonomic keyboard be just gimmick by the manufacturer , but when I need a external keyboard for my laptop , I decide to try one of those . at $ 15 , this keyboard do not cost too much above the regular cheap one , so I guess why not try this comfort keyboard . turn out this keyboard be really comfortable ! I do not realize it until I use this keyboard , but on normal straight keyboard , we wrist be actually force to bend a little bit , and this keyboard eliminate that problem . no more strain after hour of write term papers . there be a short learning curve , perhaps 2-3 day , to get use to the different feel of the key ' layout . this keyboard also increase typing speed , especially if you be a touch typist . the increase be pretty significant , sometimes I have press the next button before I lift my finger off the shift key , so my capitalize word look like this . I be use to the amount of time require to press shift button in normal keyboard , so that take I a while to get use to . some shortcut button on top of the keyboard be pretty useful , and no installation whatsoever be require to enjoy those button . the one that I use the most be back\/forward for browse , and volume up\/down\/mute . there be also a handy calculator button above the number pad on the right , which be also very helpful . overall , for $ 15 , this be a excellent purchase . highly recommend for people who earn they living by typing for hour at a time .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have try dozen of mouse and keyboard and this be the best in every category . the feel of the keyboard be good and it be clearly readable even in low light . the mouse be comfortable and quiet and work smoothly with no jump around . the keyboard and mouse both work for a very long time on very few battery -lrb- just one for the mouse -rrb- . there be a low battery indicator on the mouse . the keyboard and mouse both wake up from sleep seamlessly - no accidental button press as with other wireless device . the range be superb - I have no issue use the mouse or keyboard from the other side of a large room . I use these for both Windows and Ubuntu with no configuration require . Perfect .
Keyboard	POS	4	since it be a droid we know Google will be upgrade and upgrade and upgrade - so maybe in a year it will be worth the full $ 300 . 1 . can not believe how easily it combine verizon , youtube , internet , netflick , pandora , hbo et al into search and give we quality feedback 2 . the keyboard be real quality and have many touch which make surf easier e.g. a key in the upper left corner for mouse click and the mouse pad on the upper right for page transportation - I be not sure lefty 's will be as happy but I will have my son check that out and let you know . 3 . can lay flat on the couch and easily surf the web on my 42 '' plasma tv . and it take up all 42 inch e.g. I like Annenbergs French in Action and I can click on any of the 52 lesson and it be just like be there . 4 . family picture on picasa\/google be full screen and look very good - not as smooth as my 18 '' laptop but great for the whole family to sit around the living room and laugh at how we look year ago . have some trouble boot googletv but a quick call to logiteck solve all my problem politely and professionally . except for the price I be very pleased - but I know that before I spend the $ 300 - and now that I have googletv run it would be much easier for I to make the same purchase again . you have extremely high expectation if you be disappoint with the logiteck\/googletv product . UPDATE : leave hand son be very comfortable with the keyboard . a week after my initial review I still believe this product be quality and I be use it more than my 18.5 '' laptop .
Keyboard	POS	4	pro  adjustable  Rubber matte finish be great  good concept  Easy to establish Bluetooth connection with ipad  like the hotkey , especially the home and lock button con - hard to open and adjust without get fingerprint on ipad . - screen be top-heavy ... and fall backwards if not adjust correctly . - lock placement above backspace -lrb- delete -rrb- key be bad . - keyboard be too compact . - bottom left of the keyboard be lower than the rest of the keyboard . - keyboard be warped
Keyboard	POS	4	there be nothing wrong with this keyboard . the key have what I would call , a geographic , tactile shape , so it give the user more clue as to what key they be on . since I cheat in my high school typing class , it do not help I so much . it be a nice keyboard if price be you 1st priority .
Keyboard	POS	5	I want a keyboard with key that light up , and I want something good for gaming . this keyboard satisfy both . there be a hardware switch on the keyboard to disable the Windows key . that be very handy . the 12 programmable g-key be nice , and the keyboard be very quiet when typing . even if I do not play pc game , this would be a perfect keyboard for everyday use . with my old Logitech keyboard -lrb- just a plain cheap usb keyboard -rrb- , I have problem with try to play my game , for example , the `` v '' key would not register if I be press w and E. this keyboard greatly reduce problem like that , although the feature be undocumented . if you need a keyboard that can do more than a normal keyboard and you want to get something nice without spend too much , this be the keyboard for you . I pay $ 60 and it be worth it . the built-in port for a headset be awesome , and the fact that the keyboard have a usb port built-in means that you can plug in you gaming mouse or a flash drive right into the keyboard . I like this keyboard a lot , and I recommend it highly .
Keyboard	POS	5	I just want to say that I pick the keyboard up the other day , and I like it a lot . the space bar issue seem to be fix because it be very easy to press for I . so if that be what hold you back , I would say try it out for yourself at a local store . the overall build quality be excellent , and it work fine with Vista .
Keyboard	POS	5	it be easy to install and a pleasure to use . it have make work from home tremendously easy . sit in a chair try to type into the big screen tv that we also use as a computer be so hard unless I light up the room . now I can work in the dark or with the tv on . I be not sure why else one would need it but it I be 100 % satisfied and it be exactly what we set up call for .
Keyboard	NEG	2	since purchase the Logitech revue , i go through three unit . each one have totally different , yet major flaw . finally return the device for good for a full refund . First defective unit : have a non-responsive left arrow key on the keyboard . could not go through the setup process without the use of it . exchange unit for another one . second defective unit : after a day , start reboot uncontrollably . exchange it for another one . third defective unit : after a day of use , there be a mysterious pixelated gray distortion right in the middle of the screen when watch video . Power cycle resolve it for about 5 minute or so . return it for good ! I would also like to mention that all three of these unit be unable to see my 802.11 n network , or even my neighbor 's . it only would see my 802.11 g band . browse logitech 's forum show this seem to be the case . the logitech revue may possibly be 802.11 g only ! if this be the case , that will be false advertising . I would also like to mention that 99 % of the major network provider have block all video content from be view on any google tv device . I find the logitech revue to be only a netflix player when i be use it . I recommend wait a year before try google tv . I also recommend never purchase this logitech revue . 1 star , and 1 extra star for the effort .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be look for a rf mouse\/keyboard that will go beyond the logitech 's 6 foot range and also a keyboard small enough to place on my lap . I be have a lot of trouble with my logitech 's keyboard reception , I use my BigScreen tv as a monitor and work away from my desk -lrb- sometimes I work in bed ! -rrb- .  the installation be straight foward since they be use the Windows usb human Interface Drivers . if you have Windows 98se or greater you 'll be ok .  keyboard : the keyboard be good , rf work better than logitech , it be small enough to place on you lap -lrb- if you do not like laptop keyboard this be not the right keyboard for you -rrb- . it have 15 shortcut button , but since there be no software you can not change they functionality . the button work as follow : \* next Track , Prev Track , Play\/Pause , Stop , volume + , volume - , mute -lrb- work with Windows CD Player or the default media player -rrb- \* back , foward , stop , refresh , home , search , favorite -lrb- work with ie -rrb- \* Mail -lrb- workw with the default mail app -rrb- . note : you 'll need me or greater to take full advantage of the sortcut button .  mouse : the mouse be awesome ! , it work both as a optical or gyroscopic mouse . the gyroscopic functionality be the best , it take I about 5 minute to get use to it and the more I use it the better I get -lrb- it be the same learning process as use a mouse for the first time -rrb- .  -------------------------------------------------------- pro : Easy to install 25 Feet rf range Optical and Gyroscopic Mouse  Small Keyboard Good look  con : shortcut key can not be customize need win me or greater to take full advantage of the Keyboard Shorcuts .
Keyboard	NEG	2	during first-time setup the revue install the 3.1 Honeycomb update in around 20 minute . yes , the media player be seriously lack . I mean , it do not even support external subtitle . my 3.5 year old wdtv be infinitely better at play file from usb drive . for online video , I be almost happy with the revue , but then I try to play a full episode of Conan from teamcoco.com and the shockwave plug-in keep on crash . I try the same video on my laptop and they play flawlessly . the android market sound good , but so far all the app for the revue be really worthless . I return the revue since it can not replace my WDTV and it do not reliably play online video -lrb- other than YouTube -rrb- .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use a Microsoft Natural keyboard for many year , start with they very first model . a friend give I a first generation Mac Mini , complete with Mac keyboard , and while I love the Mini the keyboard drive I nut . I need to find a fairly compact ergonomic keyboard , due to desk space constraint , and this be what I find . I could type all day on it -lrb- at 110wpm -rrb- with no problem at all . it work perfectly with my Mac . I just wish it be a usb keyboard rather than my have to use a PS\/2 - -rrb- usb adapter , but that be a minor quibble . it be a great keyboard and definitely recommend for anyone who type fast and type a lot .
Keyboard	POS	5	I own five of these - do that say enough ? First of all I be go to come right out and say that I completely do not understand the number of 1 and 2 star review . I hate to refer to someone as a moron base on they review of a keyboard , but in this case , it be entirely difficult not to . I find myself ask `` what be wrong with these people ? '' a lot while read the negative review . that say , I notice that a lot of the negative review be write by programmer , and perhaps they need be different than mine . I have spend the better part of the last 15 year of my life in front of a computer . I find that entirely depress for the most part , but it be true . for many year I be a enthusiast , and then I spend 5 year as a computer repair guy in a local computer shop , after which I move onto a job in the web host industry and spend 5 year mixed between tech support and management . I start use this keyboard during the management phase of my time at the web host company , and ... wow . it really make a huge difference in my comfort level sit at the desk . I have begin to develop a bit of carpel tunnel , tingle in my wrist and finger , etc ; after buy this keyboard , it all go away . I be not suggest that will be everyone 's experience , just that it be my own . I have own a whole lot of keyboard , and this be easily the best that I have ever use . it be rock solid , have perfectly size key and a nice , soft wrist rest built-in . a lot of these programmer type in the negative review have complain about the space bar be hard to strike , but that be not my experience ; in my time with this keyboard , it be be a breeze . I almost never use the short-cut key at the top ; just never get in the habit . they work , though , for the record . at the beginning of this review I state that I own 5 of these keyboard . I should add that I have also buy these for many people that I know , and they have all adjust to it quite well and love it . no one I know first-hand have ever have any issue with it .
Keyboard	NEU	3	so i get the keyboard and be very excite since i have destroy my old keyboard with water lol . so anyways i get it all hook up and all but a few of the key work on it and unfortunatly the six key on both the keyboard and the number pad do not work but other than that its great , i think i can live with the few key not work but it would have be nice have all the key work
Keyboard	POS	5	I purchase the 1st trent case with wireless keyboard ; I like it but it be very fragile . after about 1 month of continual use , the latch break ; which render the case useless . the 1st generation version now sale for $ 44.00 -lrb- but I would advise against purchase it -rrb- . anyway here be what I like so far about the New Trent one : -lrb- 1 -rrb- sturdy construction -lrb- 2 -rrb- ipad fit nicely -lrb- 3 -rrb- look like it cost more than it actually do -lrb- 4 -rrb- 6 position for hold the ipad -lrb- 5 -rrb- turn the iPad off in closed position -lrb- 6 -rrb- keyboard very responsive with a sturdy feel to it similar to a small laptop -lrb- unlike the Trent 1 -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- not as heavy as I think that it be go to be -lrb- 8 -rrb- since ipad be not attach to the actual case , you can use the tablet freely without a heavy case hang onto it -lrb- 9 -rrb- can completely remove the keyboard from base to type , need I say more ? this be a great investment ! note : the iPad simply rest in the case , it do not lock in , so if you plan to use it while you be sit on you bed or couch , be careful . also I be a little worried that the case might scratch the face of my ipad . I 'll update if my fear come true . do not miss out on this one , it be the real deal ! I be so pleased . UPDATE : I still love my case ; wish I have the new Zagg , but it cost between 30-50 dollar more . no scratch , at least not yet . remember that you can always buy a screen protective sheet through Amazon -lrb- 3 for about $ 4.00 -rrb- ; or if you have a dollar tree in you city , they run a buck a piece -lrb- so why pay more -rrb- . be careful when open you case , I almost tear off a key . you may want to practice opening and close the case to avoid compication when you may need you tablet most . happy shopping !
Keyboard	POS	5	I purchase the Ultimate keyboard at my local Fry 's electronics store . unfourtunately it be a open box item and I despise that type of item but be the last one and I could not be bother to go to a different store . I open the item and check it closely for any scratch , ding , key broken\/mixed , etc. . it look as if it be not use . note the box look very use . prior history : I have look over many `` gaming keyboard '' produce by various company . the g11 by logitech look like it would suit my need and have alot of Macro key as well . when I use it , it feel a bit cheap and I could not stand how far to the leave it extend as I miss my esc key alot due to it . aside from that the vengence by Corsair be nice , I like the seperate color key , but it do not fit the aesthetics I want . I want a sleek keyboard , with loud click like 80 's style keyboard -lrb- as I really enjoy the sound -rrb- , backlit key , and macro key . there be a standard keyboard on sale that sound great , but no macro key : -lrb- Currently : I have be use this keyboard for a little over 2 week , I have customize the key to fit my need -lrb- cap lock disabled and set for a Ventrilo Push to talk button . -rrb- Macros to help my mmo need and repetitive datum entry need . as I normally work late at night the back light to the keyboard be very nice , and the clack of the key create a really nice audio sensation . the sound arent overpower but almost reassure you hit the right key with speed . I be able to double click the keye very quickly with little pressure which be perfect in the necessary game I play . the extra port on the side of the keyboard be perfect for quick access to my computer without go behind my machine . pro : audible clack upon press key backlit keyboard macro key reassignment\/disable\/program launch quick and interactive installation be quick and easy Easy access port on side con : key may be to loud for other -lrb- not I -rrb- can not change the light color for certain game mode -lrb- g11 do -rrb- note : I have not check my space bar or any overlap of key , but I have not have a problem so far . I would reccomend this keyboard , and purchase it again , despite its steep cost .
Keyboard	POS	5	it be also a lightweight and inexpensive alternative to the traditional keypad available . \* initial inspection \*\* test \*\*\* pro 's and con 's \*\*\*\* Conclusion \* the keyboard \/ mouse come as a 3-piece package . in addition to the keyboard and mouse , there be also a small receiver that plug into the usb port . the mouse run on two -lrb- 2 -rrb- aa battery -lrb- supply -rrb- and the keyboard run on two -lrb- 2 -rrb- AAA battery , also supply . \*\* installation take all of 30 seconds from the moment you plug in the receiver . this set be suppose to work exclusively with Windows xp through Windows 7 . as I have a copy of Windows xp nestle in VMWare fusion , this be where I be go to base my review upon , however this set be instantly recognize by the Mac 's OS . go figure . one of the thing you 'll immediately recognize be that the key have just enough resistance and spring to make typing easy and fast . the key be also amply spread apart for bigger finger . on the winxp side , the set work perfectly with Microsoft Office 2000 , Windows Media Player and Roxio Creator 2010 -lrb- at least , the work software in Roxio 's bundle . -rrb- on the Mac side , Microsoft Office 2008 , iTunes , Quicktime and Adobe CS3 be responsive to the keyboard and mouse . in fact , I be write this review from the Mac side . the only difference would be that the shortcut key on the Mac side : command + , be now Windows -lrb- icon -rrb- + , everything else include the volume , light , work the same . a dedicated media key on the header row have to be program before it 'll work for either pc or mac . compare the slimboard to Apple 's `` Wireless Keyboard , '' both key have a wonderful touch response . and , with the exception of Apple 's be make out of aluminum and verbatim 's of plastic , the only really difference be the additional 7 '' that accommodate the traditional pc numeric pad . the difference in height and width be negligible . all thing be equal , with a separate keypad on the Apple , it would be about the same length . \*\*\* pro 's and con 's pro 's + beautiful , glossy finish . + key response be very good . + function with both pc and Intel Mac ! + Lightweight . + Inexpensive . con 's - -lrb- not really a negative criticism , but the keyboard be very long .

Keyboard	NEG	1	top row of key do not work . supplier say the return have to go to the manufacturer but there be no manufacturer list on the packaging . keyboard be cheap but the shipping rate be inflate . they have a 30 % restock fee and I have to pay the return shipping . a return just be not worth it . beware purchase from Amazon where they be not the supplier . Amazon do a excellent job of service but only when they be the supplier .
Keyboard	POS	5	I wish I have think of this . the silicon protect from dust , cat hair , and liquid , and it even make the clicking of my key quieter . what more could I want ?
Keyboard	NEU	3	I need a small keyboard . this one be small and affordable . it be kind of annoy to use though . maybe it be not fair to complain about it - since it be serve a purpose -lrb- be small -rrb- - but my general impression of the keyboard be not favorable .
Keyboard	NEG	2	I do not know if the keyboard I buy have be use before -lrb- the packaging look a little suspect -rrb- but when I use this product , it be always a guess game as to which key would not be work - sometimes one or two sometimes 10 or 12 . I really , really like the concept ; I think that it increase the usability of the Palm 100 % since you can keep it open on you desk and enter stuff very quickly . I hesitate to talk badly about anything Palm since I have have one for 5 year and do not go anywhere without it . Suffice to say that I be very disapointed .
Keyboard	NEU	3	foreign buyer beware be for english layout keyboard . i fix mine with a black permanent marker and a silver marker but sill the enter key be different size so i have to use a scissor also .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be a writer and I be so glad I find this keyboard ! the keyboard have a slight ergonomic wave to it that I adjust to without even notice the difference . the hand rest be firm , yet comfortable and build into the keyboard . and can I just say that this keyboard be totally pimp out ! there be so many different programmable function key that I have not even use they all yet . a few of my favorite : I love that there be a button with a camera on it and I can program it to open up my picture with one click . there be also a button with music note . with a push of that button , my iTunes open up ready to go . use the Fn key plus any of the f key number from 1-12 will open up a different feature . for example , I program the `` w '' for the word program on the f1 key to open up my current work in progress . the f2 key have a x for Excel and it be program to open up my spreadsheet so that I can track my word count progress for my current WIP . I love typing on this keyboard . the button have just enough give , be not too `` clicky '' and I feel like I can type even faster than before . the mouse be great . it be the first time , I have have a mouse with the forward and back button for web-surfing on the side -- soooo handy ! if you have be wishy-washy in the past about update you keyboard and mouse , I would suggest take the plunge and get the Logitech Wireless Wave mk 550 keyboard and mouse combo . I think you 'll love it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use the Microsoft Natural keyboard for a number of year . I really think this be the best one yet . it be very comfortable and the key have a great feel to they .
Keyboard	POS	5	if you be like I and use you ThinkPad every day , you have get very use to the touch and speed of the keyboard and trackpoint -lrb- the red dot -rrb- . this keyboard have the same touch with a add numeric keyboard . the back edge of the keyboard also have 2 usb port -lrb- near the f4 & f5 key -rrb- . I never check to see if they support usb 2.0 though . one thing that be not include be a power button , but now I be get really picky . all in all , another excellent keyboard from IBM . -lrb- yes , it still have the IBM logo on it . -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	5	a excellent buy ! I have try these curvy keyboard before , but this be the first one I be able to start use right away without hit all the wrong key . it just fit so much better - and the raise front with the wrist rest be fantastic . I be skeptical about pay $ 50 for a keyboard , but it be worth it .
Keyboard	POS	5	i be so pleased with this keyboard . it be the best keyboard i have ever use . i be a bud writer and have write quite a bit . the lighting be so nice look . i can lie in bed and type easily see the key with no light on to bother my wife . it be also quiet , and have a nice feel to the key . they spring back just right for I . i have only have it a week . i just hope it last for a long time i love it so much .
Keyboard	POS	4	when I find out my friend spill a drink on she laptop and ruin it , I purchase one of these . very light and it fit the key so well I do not even notice it anymore . only problem be it do not cover the speaker portion on my Macbook on the right and leave side of the keyboard . other than that , it fit and cover the keyboard completely and the price be great !
Keyboard	POS	5	awesome deal ! I be a little leery about this , because of the price , -lrb- 1 cent -rrb- but I get it very promptly . and it look , feel great on my white Macbook . the font be the same , so its like it be a factory part . the only downfall , be the the black on the skin , be like a newspaper , and get on you finger , but its not that bad ... def not something to whine about ... great deal , awesome shipping and product , highly recommend !
Keyboard	POS	4	this be a absolutely excellent product , and you just can not beat the price . in we conference room , the computer be back in a corner near the lcd projector . unfortunately , that be nowhere near the conference table where people sit . previously , we have to jockey thing around and avoid trip over cable to make thing work .  now , you can sit anywhere in the room and control the pc . you can even pass the keyboard and mouse around . Goodbye cable ! and it be completely plug-and-play . pop the include battery into the keyboard and mouse , plug the rf receiver into the keyboard and mouse port on the pc , turn on the computer , and you be up and run ! the hardest part be open the seal plastic packaging .  one other reviewer mention a inability to use the keyboard and mouse simultaneously because of channel conflict . you can -- and should -- have the two run on different channel . it even say so in the documentation . unfortunately , the default setting put both on the same channel , so you might have a problem unless you read the documentation first .  my only complaint with the product -- the only thing that keep I from give it five star -- be the size of the mouse . it be a little wide and hard for people with small hand to use . but that be nitpicking .  I be order one for home tonight !
Keyboard	POS	5	simplicity . comfort . Value . very good keyboard . oh . . and most importantly - non alphabet key -lrb- arrow key , Insert\/Delete\/Home \/ end\/pageup\/pagedown -rrb- be in `` proper '' 1980 's era `` IBM '' position . less than $ 20 . no battery to run out . no bluetooth to pair . no Wireless dongle . excellent value .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be a bit leery buying this keyboard because I be not sure how often I would have to charge it . I figure if I be plug the thing in for a full day to charge every 5 day , it would defeat the purpose of have a wireless device . much to my delight , I have own the keyboard for three month , use it 5 day a week for work , and I have charge it only once -lrb- and even then I suspect it be because the device do not have a full charge out of the box -rrb- . grant I usually turn the illumination off because I simply do not need it , but there have be several occasion where I have forget to switch the keyboard off at night and the battery meter remain full . I would strongly recommend this product to anyone look for a wireless keyboard . the illumination be a bonus for I , but if you need that it too work great . I be a huge fan of Logitech and they unifying platform . I use this keyboard in conjunction with a m510 mouse on the same receiver dongle and have have no problem .
Keyboard	POS	5	I do not think I be go to like it , and the way the company ship it , I be disappoint . but , when I take it out of the envelope and put it on my MacBook pro , I fall in love with it ! it fit perfectly , protect my key from dirt & dust , and I can still see the light keyboard through it ! the minor flaw it have be that the letters\/numbers\/symbols be not perfectly align . - just a minor insignificance !
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be look at IR keyboard for quite some time , I have a PALM Centro , Treo 700 , and a ancient pocket pc run PALM OS . although the PALM software be not compatible with my Windows 7 computer , it work fine with Vista and xp , and it be a very quick and easy setup , and work like a charm . and it be a awesome alternative to those tiny button and handwriting stylus .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I buy two of these on sale from a local retailer . while they be good as a quick replacement keyboard that be also wireless , serious typist or anyone picky may want to look elsewhere . -- pro : the wireless component work pretty well . it can also work with a Panasonic plasma tv , and some of the function key can access important part of the menu . I like the nano-receiver . I can leave it in a laptop , and wrap a sleeve around it . at the very least , the regular function key be the default , instead of force user to press a `` fn '' key just to access `` f2 '' and the like . of course , the blue-labeled function key like volume up or change track do come in handy . -- con : Logitech remove a lot of important modifier key on the right side , notably the Windows key and the context menu key , the latter of which be replace with a blue `` fn '' key . this be a disadvantage for both Windows and Mac user who frequently use keyboard shortcut . -- MISCELLANEOUS : I do not mind the `` dark fleur '' design . the feel of the keyboard , for I at least , do not quite feel substantial . I can get use to it if I be force to use it daily , but without the miss modifier key on the right side , I probably will not use it in the end . it be also kind of big to use for a home theater setup , unless you be do spreadsheet on a big screen tv . it be still fairly lightweight .
Keyboard	POS	5	excellent buy !!! the software install flawlessly , very easy to remap macro button , very very comfortable design for both the mouse and keyboard , convenient button on keyboard make great shortcut , wireless capability top all I have see by not mess up with cell phone interference . overall amazing value , amazing product !!
Keyboard	NEG	2	first I preface by say I have have pc since the 80s . this be the first keyboard I ever use that will not work correctly . it refuse to be recogize by my win 7 64bit one-year old system even after a full bio update . to operate the keyboard I have to manually unplug it and then plug it back in . Tech support want I to change bio setting ... something I have never do for ANY keyboard . what be up with that ?? the Logitech board be also pepper with problem story about this product . needless to say , this one go on the shelf -lrb- have it too long to return it -rrb- and the trusty Microsoft keyboard come out of retirement .
Keyboard	POS	4	I be typing on it now and my initial response be that the key be too stiff for a device that require a bit of finesse due to its size . my keystroke do not always register . I be sure everyone will have a opinion about key placement but I personally find the single shift key -lrb- left side -rrb- and the placement of the apostrophe to be the biggest hindrance to comfortable , accurate typing . that say , it save a ton of desk space and seem to be make well . I would not recommend its use for anyone that do a lot of typing . Stick to the minus keyboard if you need to save space -lrb- in the 11-12 '' range vs. this one 's 9 '' -rrb- , unless you truly require something this small .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I will not go into technical detail but this be the worst phone I have ever have . I would expect more from a `` pda '' but this one have be on my crap list since day 1 of use it !
Keyboard	POS	5	I be hesitant to get this keyboard simply because of the price . I have it on my wish list for about six week . then I splurge and figure I could return it if I be not blow away . well , I be and have be . right out of the box I be amaze by how professional and slick it look . the after turn it and and see the black case with the white letter ... wow ... my friend have be amaze and be very envious . after connect with my pc wirelessly the keyboard be ready to rock . no cd 's , no have to read instruction , just a easy installation per sey ... this keyboard do everything and have everything you need . the shortccut on the fn key be amazing and everything just feel right ... I have a black hd set by Samasung and this key board go perfect with that and my black logitech everything mouse . I would highly reccommend this keyboard even at the high price ... quality , function and the bell and whistle come with this keyboard ...
Keyboard	NEG	2	the silicone keyboard cover do not let the backlit key show through , and while it do protect the keyboard from dust , it make typing somewhat awkward . if you like the crisp feel of the keyboard on you macbook pro , do not bother with this .
Keyboard	NEG	1	Bluetooth stop pick up frequently , and this thing eat battery . use 4 aa battery which last about 2 week .
Keyboard	NEG	1	it be a great keyboard , but there be no driver for os x user . the keyboard will work on you mac , but you will not be able to access\/assign any of the customizable button . many of the button have no default function for os x , so they do nothing . I have contact customer support to address the issue , but never get a answer to whether or not a driver be come in the future . on the plus side , if you run window through bootcamp on you mac , the keyboard work flawlessly .
Keyboard	POS	5	everyone be always jealous of my pink keyboard . it be so easy to peel off and wash and it keep I from go crazy when I have get something stick in-between a key . so simple yet chic .
Keyboard	POS	5	it work comfortably . the volume button and Next\/Previous be handy . it share the unifying receiver with other Logitech product , so it actually `` save '' my Logitech m510 mouse b\/c I lose the mouse receiver .
Keyboard	POS	5	this keyboard be a excellent replacement for a aging Logitech keyboard I have I would definitely buy again , but probably will not need to because from my experience Logitech product be build to last . pro - very sleek design , quick media key , volume etc. . con - none
Keyboard	POS	5	it be compact , and it just work ! I buy this to replace a similar one that come with my xtreamer Ultra PC that would not pair with it be usb stub . this new one work right out of the box . the only negative for I be that the touchpad be a bit awkward to use , but I just use a usb Logitech wireless mouse that I have and I be fine now . it be nice not to have to have a large keyboard sit next to I on the couch anymore .
Keyboard	POS	4	well , for the price , this be a nice , bare bone keyboard . it do type fairly quietly and have a nice tight feel to it , and the screen respond quickly to what be type . I do not give it 5 star because the letter on the key be start to fade . I will spend more money next time and -lrb- hopefully -rrb- get a keyboard that have better quality lettering .
Keyboard	NEG	1	okay the keyboard be overall fantastic . type like a dream as far as comfort and speed . the additional macro button and function key be a big help as well . however , and this be a big however , I have have a terrible experience so far with razer 's quality control as far as these board be concern . about a week ago the -lrb- leave ctrl -rrb- key on my several day old Razer Blackwidow -lrb- the standard edition , not the ultimate -rrb- just stop work , with no explanation whatsoever , so I swap it out for a old lycosa which I have be use before while I wait for my replacement to arrive -lrb- decide to upgrade to a ultimate from the standard because I want a backlight to help I type in the dark when I game at night -rrb- . so my new board arrive , and I discover shortly after unbox it that it have a second -lrb- t -rrb- key where the -lrb- y -rrb- key should be ... keep in mind that this the second issue I have have in less than a week , with they highest quality board , no less . LONG STORY SHORT , great BOARD , BUT be ready if razer 's quality CONTROL SCREWS you over !
Keyboard	POS	4	the keyboard be easy to use and it can be use from a long distance . the problem be that some time it loose the signal . the battery life be realy good and fast to charge again !!
Keyboard	POS	4	Works pretty good . my only complaint be they do not send the color I order but for the price they be pretty good .
Keyboard	POS	5	this product really do not leave anything else to be desire . it fit the keyboard on my 2010 MacBook pro perfectly and look great to boot . it sit flush to the key and play between key non-existant . this cover also give the key more of a texturized feel , which be a good change from the glossy stock key .
Keyboard	NEG	1	the key be label for Windows only . every time the Mac reboot , I have to re-identify the keyboard because the Mac do not recognize it . in addition , like most cheapo keyboard it have no extra usb port . the key be not that annoying , but they be annoying , especially if you move from keyboard to keyboard ; this one will always be the odd one out , with it be somewhat small and slant key . all in all , you would be much better off get a generic Windows keyboard at you local big box store . again : this should not be call Mac compatible , despite what be print on the box . I be simply glad I buy it at half its suggest retail price . this be the lowest rating I have ever give a product sell by Amazon .
Keyboard	POS	4	i buy this for my mac minus when i take the bluetooth keyboard and use it for my ipad 2 . after i sync the blue tooth keyboard to my ipad i need something to get past the password on start up . will use for other light typing but buy this one cheap since that will be the primary function .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have purchase this keyboard\/mouse combo many time for the business I work at , and it be honestly the best one I have see and use ... the ergonomic effect be not overwhelming and the surround shortcut key be great ! it have a great feel to it , also .
Keyboard	POS	4	this be a great little keyboard . it be small , light and just what I need to streamline typing large amount of text into my new Treo 650 smart phone . unfortunately , it cease to work at seemingly random time . sometimes it restart itself and sometimes it will not work unless I perform a soft reset . I do not know why it do this , but I wish Palm would fix it .
Keyboard	NEU	3	have it a few hour . so far it be okay . I be still get use to the subtle difference in key spacing , but none of the key be swap as other have report . I like the mechanical feel of the key , and even on the lowest set the backlighting be brighter than my old g15 . but they be loud - even louder than the Dell mechanical keyboard I use at work . plus , I do not like the style of the key at all . some letter be hardly recognizable ; they be not upper or lower case - they be just weird . but I know where everything 's at on a keyboard anyway , so I 'll probably get use to that . the thing I really dislike be the location of the extra usb port and audio jack . the right side be the last place a right hand person would ever want those jack . if use , the cable stick out right where I use my mouse , and the headset cable drape across where my right hand and arm be which I want to keep free . I can just not use these jack I guess , but this aspect of the design be so pathetic I can not even grasp how it come to fruition . what be also bad about this be the other end of the cable . if I only plug in the main usb connector , the other just hang there put strain on the one that \* be \* connect . if I connect the 2nd usb but do not use it , it waste that port on the back of my pc , and that be not even a option for the audio jack - I have to use they for the headset . so I 'll have to twist-tie the loose end to the case or some other cable or something . \*\* edit \*\* I come back to bump up my rating to 4 star because I find that this keyboard do something great . but then I also discover that another of its tout feature be so flaky it be basically useless , so the rating stay at 3 . okay , \* this \* be great . I find that it let you assign macro or alternate key function to almost ANY key - not just the extra macro key on the side like my g15 limit I to . this mean you can completely move a key around . when I play game , I use Ventrilo for voice chat , but I never really like where I have my left-side push-to-talk key . but with this keyboard , I be able to assign my PPT key to my cap lock key and cap lock to my PTT key - in effect swap they ! this be a simple but extremely powerful feature . however , after set up a profile with several swap key , I have ton of issue with the auto-profile switch feature . basically , it be very flaky . I play around with set the correct . exe to base the profile activation off of , and get it to work - sometimes . other time it just would not work at all . also , I find that when my custom profile activate sometimes it would just deactivate for no reason . but when I pull up the Razer utility from the system tray the checkbox would show as if it be still active . when I click on the profile from there to make it the active one , sometimes it would stay on , but most of the time it would activate and then just go back to the default one a few seconds later . the same thing happen when open up the main utility and select the profile from there . I even try unassign the . exe from my custom profile , and play with all of the option over and over . but basically , no matter what I do ... I could not even get it to stay on a custom profile when manually select it - that be HORRIBLE . I 'll try to completely delete the custom profile and re-create it or maybe even re-install the Razer app ... but I have a bad feeling that if I want the power of the swap key I 'll probably have to permanently swap they in the default profile and that stink , especially when my g\/f or someone else use my keyboard and try to use one of my swap key and get all screw up .
Keyboard	POS	4	if you be familiar with use ergonomic keyboard , you 'll probably like this model . I have be use a contoured keyboard for about 4 year . even though it take a while to get use to the contour , I now have trouble go back to the old straight style . I also like the feel of the key since I be a heavy-handed typer . I be replace this keywboard with a new one because several of the key be break , which be part of why I downgrade the keyboard . I do not think the key should have break off so easily . another issue I have be that it be quite large and use a lot of desk space . this may be just a function of any contoured board , but I think a little engineering would result in a better design .
Keyboard	POS	5	love the weight of the key . it be a sleek , basic look . own the product for three week . mouse be a little bulkier than I would like and scroll be not as smooth as most mouse . Perfect for my need and budget
Keyboard	NEG	1	I buy the HP Ultra Thin Wireless Keyboard for many reason : 1 -rrb- need a wireless keyboard 2 -rrb- need a fairly compact keyboard 3 -rrb- be already use a HP wireless mouse with link-5 , and do not want to add another usb receiver to my system 4 -rrb- price be right 5 -rrb- figure HP quality would be fine , for a keyboard when I get the thing , I could not get it to connect to my link-5 wireless receiver that come with my HP mouse . at first , I think the keyboard itself be defective . but then I try the receiver that come with the keyboard , and it work for the keyboard . but then my HP mouse would not connect . take I a while to figure out what be go on . there be two version of this keyboard , the old style -lrb- the one I be review -rrb- and the new style -lrb- the one I want , the one I think I order ! -rrb- the difference between the two be the receiver and the model number . this be bk114aa , the one you do not want . the one you might want to order be a0b42aa . that be the exact same keyboard , but it have the link-5 receiver . I be kind of upset that this be not make more clear in the advertising for this product . it be like have two car , one with a\/c and one without . but not be able to know which be which until after the sale ... -lrb- well that be a nasty surprise -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	5	this be easy to use and work well . I literally take the keyboard out of the box , insert the transceiver -lrb- which have a storage spot on the back of the keyboard -rrb- into a usb port on my computer , insert two AAA battery that be include into the keyboard and the keyboard start work . the keyboard be approximately 13 inch by six inch . this give I much more flexibility when I be work at my desk and have a bunch of papers in front of I . I can move the keyboard around my desk with ease . my only complaint be that the keyboard do not have little pullout leg that allow it to be raise at a angle . if I be rest the keyboard on my lap it be not a big deal but I be usually work at a desk and I be use to a keyboard at a angle . this be a great product at a good price . I do with be could be raise at a angle though .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I have use this keyboard enough to wear\/short out a couple ; useful and well-thought-out design . but my newest replacement have a mushy feel to the key -- no life in they . disappointing .
Keyboard	NEG	2	buy it and think it be great . then I notice that touchpad tap could not be disabled . nor could touchpad scrooling . talk to manufacturer , they say the device have no driver other than the microsoft pnp one and that these two feature be not available . this be a real problem if you do not hunt-n-peck type . if you type like you be suppose to for speed , this keyboard be problematic . the touchpad be extremely sensative -lrb- not changable -rrb- and if you inadvertently drag you thumb across it the cursor go all over the place , and so do you typing . until Adesso come up with a driver that can : 1 -rrb- disable tape on touchpad , 2 -rrb- disable scrool on touchpad , 3 -rrb- decrease sensativity of touchpad I would say this be a no-buy product . but it do have potential , just unrealized .
Keyboard	NEG	1	pick this up at a local store on the cheap . I read other reviewer complain about it looking\/feeling cheap . Umm ... it \* be \* cheap . all I want be a simple , usb keyboard with more action in the key than my current 10-year old keyboard . I look at the key location closely ... but not close enough . I get it all the way home and start write a letter before I realize that the bozo that design this keyboard take the `` pipe '' and `` backslash '' key -lrb- meaning '' | '' and '' \ '' -rrb- which be usually to the left of the `` right-shift '' button , and jam it between the backspace key and the + \/ = key . my question to the designer be ... why ???? you elongate the right-shift key to fill the space leave by remove the '' | '' and \ key , and you shorten the backspace key by half -lrb- put in the `` wrong '' place for touch typer -rrb- in order to jam the same '' | '' and \ key between the backspace and the + \/ = key . I love the feel and the price of the keyboard . everything else be just perfect -lrb- yeah , it be cheap construction ... but the price be cheap as well -rrb- . I do not get it . I be take this keyboard back immediately . oh , and as for those who might not care about the backspace key , if you plan on use this keyboard for gaming , then I also have to agree with the other reviewer that you will probably be better serve by one that be a bit more `` rugged '' . this keyboard will not stand up to any abuse from the look of it . the biggest problem I can cite -lrb- as other reviewer have as well -rrb- be that the cable be ridiculously thin and no doubt fragile . I doubt it be reinforce at the connector or keyboard end at all . for a cheap keyboard , it would have work well ... if the key have be in the correct location .
Keyboard	NEG	1	not only do this have the OVERHEATING and NOT be transparent issue but it rip right out of the box . it be fold , so when i try to unfold it , it just rip . do not . get . this .
