Video_Games	NEU	3	at first I be a bit disappointed that this be not a real rpg like BG or bg2 . dark Alliance -lrb- DA -rrb- be more a action rpg like the Diablo game . DA have great graphic and music -lrb- far better than Diablo 2 -rrb- and be pretty addictive . it do not make a real impact though . a solid action rpg , but nothing really special .
Video_Games	NEU	3	I really look at these ` activity center ' software package for my kid . unfortunately there be not much to go on with this one . the graphic be nice , but the activity get old after about 20 minute . my 6 year old plow thru this and get tire of it after 30 minute ! this be one of those software program that you be better off wait to buy it when its in the discount rack .

Video_Games	POS	5	as Stephen King 's Number one fan -lrb- wink , wink -rrb- , I can only say how awesome it be to have Stephen King 's f13 run on my computer . it be gory graphic and creepy sound be just what I would expect from the `` king of horror '' . my particularly favorite feature be have Stephen King in a corner of my screen clack away at a new story in real-time . that and a new -lrb- lengthy -rrb- short story . I will not give too much away , but it be one of he creepier one . I would definitely recommend this product to a friend .
Video_Games	POS	5	the Starter Bundle make it quick and easy for those who already have a PS3 to get a idea of what move be about . depend on what you already have on you PS3 and of what\/how you be plan to play , all you may need could be just the move controller and nothing else or you may want to order some additional controller instead of this bundle . if you do not have a PS3 , then the  PlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation move bundle  what you get , what else you MAY NEED\/WANT briefly , this be what you get in with this bundle and I will make it very short because there be a lot of info . at the Amazon page : \* move controller , of course \* PlayStation Eye camera -lrb- must have for the move to work -rrb- \* Sports Champions -lrb- Ping Pong be simply awesome , some of the game play much better with a second controller -rrb- \* a disc with demo which should be available at the PSN store as well depend on how you be plan to play you game , this be what you do not get but may end up buy eventually : - one more additional move controller -lrb- some game will either require two controller or will play better with two -rrb- - Navigation Controller -lrb- s -rrb- -lrb- you can use the DualShock in you left hand but it feel weird -rrb- - one or more extra usb wire if you do not have enough already to charge you new controller -lrb- s -rrb- or - dedicate charger , especially if you have more than one move controller and\/or Navigation controller -lrb- s -rrb- go for the starter bundle or not ? the Motion Controller and the PS Eye be the minimum need to bring ` move ' to a any PS3 console . no exception . if you already have a PS Eye then the controller alone be the only purchase necessary . on the other hand , to fully enjoy certain game , you may want two move controller . this starter bundle make sense if you do not have the Eye already and you be into the type of game that Sports Champions have . you could still get it and then sell the Eye if you already have one . the same go for the Sports Champions . it come seal so you can sell it as ` new ' and recover some fund in the process . move 's motion controller the Wikipedia have a very thorough review of the technology inside the controller - impressive . it be probably worth go there to get a idea of what be under the hood . from a user 's point of view , the move could be view as approximately the right side of the DualShock 3 where the motion tracking function be the r3 analog stick , r1 be the move button and the r2 become the move 's t -lrb- rigger -rrb- . you also get the 4 square\/circle\/x \/ Triangle , in a square -lrb- not ` diamond ' -rrb- formation , the PS button as well as the START and SELECT . so far , the most used button during gameplay be the move and the t -lrb- rigger -rrb- . in addition , you get a wrist strap . at the opposite end of the microphone-shaped move there be a usb mini-b port for charge and another port that seem to be proprietary - must investigate . the controller be quite substantial as far as both size and weight - I like that and like its be shape in a way that make it easy to grab and hold . very much like a microphone or a very thick magic wand ; NOT a remote control . base on my experience so far , move 's ability to track you motion far surpass anything that I be aware of in the gaming universe . every single movement , up\/down , left\/right , toward\/away and wrist rotation be accurately capture and almost instantly reflect on the screen and so be acceleration that would usually translate as ` force ' in game such as sword fight or ping pong . in addition , there be haptic -lrb- tactile\/rumble -rrb- feedback , a little too weak in the game I play so far , make the gaming experience that much more realistic . I be not write a lot about the Eye camera because ... it be just there and it be not the subject of this review . for as long as it can see you , it simply do its part so that you may enjoy you game . the GAME Sports Champions consist of 6 separate event where you play through one of the available character either against the other character provide by the game or against another player - will need a second move controller for that . as expect , there be level of difficulty , medal and various bonus . ping pong show move 's nothing short of amazing ability to track its controller position in 3d space and , better , even detect move such as wrist rotation and to track acceleration as ` force ' and do it in real time . play Ping Pong be challenging , fun , frustrating and addictive . my entire arm , from wrist all the way up to the neck hurt already and I be not even do with the bronze medal challenge yet -lrb- almost there -rrb- . ARCHERY be probably second most popular , at least in we household . we like it because , unlike PING PONG , we do not sweat a lot while play it . ARCHERY be also one of the 3 include game that make it quite clear that you will be much better off with two Motion Controllers . some of the challenge look quite cheesy - shooting at float money bag but we have spend some time play it and it be likely that we be go to play some more in the future . the GLADIATOR sword fight game , even more than ARCHERY would benefit from two Motion Controllers - one for the sword\/axe and a second for a shield . with one controller only , you must pull the trigger to raise and use you shield or use the sword otherwise . yes , Sony give we button but the game be ten time more realistic when you actually push you shield forward the way you would actually do it in real life rather than pull the trigger to raise the shield and , at the same time push the move button while make a ` push ' motion . BOCCE ... ever play it ? I have a couple of time . Plays well with one controller but it can be a little boring . good simulation . FRISBEE golf be not bad . actually play it in real life on the course we have at the nearby state park . it be a little slow but it be good relaxation after you sweat yourself out on PING PONG or GLADIATOR . VOLLEYBALL , again , can be so much better with two Motion Controllers . also , be careful if you play in a room with low ceiling or anything that hang from the ceiling like a ceiling fan or a priceless crystal candelabrum . consider that Sports Champions be a early game , my expectation be not that high but , surprisingly , Ping Pong exceed my expectation . I have be play real Ping Pong ever since I be 11 or 12 so I probably know what I be talk about and the move version of Ping Pong be GOOD . as for the other ... sword fight , not so good . Archery be okay , Bocce be so-so , Frisbee Golf not too bad . for the game I have play so far , this be not a couch experience . on the Sports event I be sweating after a few minute and my move arm be now hurt from the wrist all the way up to the neck . MY RATING it be 5 star for the technical merit , ease of setup and for the overall experience . hopefully , lot of good game will be come quickly .

Video_Games	POS	4	I have play this game a fair amount since release and feel I can give a review on my initial impression on the game . it be a mmo so the game will evolve over time , so some of my statement may no longer be relevant after patch be release . pro : + Graphics + soloable -lrb- party be still faster -rrb- + in depth , skill base craft system + storyline + music + extremely large zone , you will rarely come across zone line con : - uus lag for npc interaction , change equipment , and craft - no auction House\/Market search -lrb- detail below -rrb- - teleport consume Anima , you gain enough Anima for 1 to 1.5 teleport a day - chat system be clunky , and linkshell -lrb- guild -rrb- chat can easily be lose in battle spam -lrb- you deal x damage to y monster -rrb- . filter be avalible , but not complete . - content lock out currently . ishgard -lrb- the new Jeuno for FFXI player -rrb- be close . you can not ride chocobo yet . no airship . this make travel time consuming , and no central place for meeting people . - uus do not improve over XI , pretty much the same -lrb- just more\/different menu option -rrb- . - Account management be clunky beyond belief . I would also like to hit on a few point that have people worry before release . the biggest be probably the fatigue system where people be afraid that se would limit you play time . well , I can tell you that unless you be a power leveler -lrb- as in play all day every day -rrb- you will not hit the limit . you can get into the 20 's for rank within a single week , the cap for the game be currently 50 . so if 3 week be too long to reach max level ... then I guess the fatigue system will be a problem for you . for we mortal who must sleep however it be not something you be likely to run into . level pace be extreamly fast for the first 10 rank , once you hit rank 10 however you hit a wall and thing slow down , a lot . I also want to go into more detail on one of my con , the lack of a auction house\/search system . in this game almost all you equipment will come from crafter . not drop . not buy from npc shop . this give crafter in the game a real purpose , and I like that because I enjoy craft . this be completely opposite to game like WoW where the vast majority of craft goods be ` useless ' in comparison to dungeon drops\/quest reward . to sell item you can create a npc retainer who act like a shop keeper . you put they in a area that act like a market square where other player can walk around and view each shop . there be no way to search who be sell what , or who be buy what . you have to go through each retainer , one by one , and there be thousand of they . you be look at significant time to search through a sea of stuff you do not want to try and find the item you need ... at a price you can afford . the problem with this be all the craft be dependent on each other . want to make a spear as a blacksmith ? you 'll need a carpenter to make the shaft , and the carpenter will need raw wood from a botanist . you 'll also need some leather for the grip , which you get from a leather worker , who need chemical from a alchemist to cure the hide . you can see how this be go , if you want to make something you need to buy component from other crafter -lrb- or level that craft yourself -rrb- . with no auction house or market search feature it be near impossible to find the item you need , which make craft gear near impossible , which mean once you get into the teens for rank , and certainly into the 20 's , you gear be really start to hurt you . that be my biggest complaint with the game . se have say they have something ready -lrb- either ah or search feature -rrb- but they be wait to see what player do with the economy ... this be really stupid in my opinion as this issue be turn a lot of people away from they game , include I . fix this one issue and my rating of the game will increase a substantial amount . my recommendation would be to wait to purchase this game until they have fix the ah\/market search problem . once that be fix , it really have the potential to be a great mmorpg . -lrb- small note on collector 's edition . the NA crowd get shaft big time compare to EU . we get less stuff -lrb- know before purchase -rrb- but also the journal be crap compare to the EU one . -rrb- update 9\/29\/2010 : Square-Enix have announce plan to re-do the market ward . they 'll name each ward towards specific category of equipment\/items and any item sell in that ward that fall under its category will have a reduce tax . player be not force to sell only that category goods though . they plan to implement this in 1 to 2 week . I can see this improve the situation , but not entirely solve it . since each player be currently limit to a single retainer you can expect the category to only be loosely follow . se plan to allow player to have multiple retainer , but likely at a real world cost of $ 1\/extra retainer -lrb- this price be announce long ago before the game release -rrb- . I will personally probably get 2 extra retainer to make the game cost be $ 14.99 which be equal to other pay to play MMO 's . it should be note that each retainer have a 80 item capacity so the more you have , the more storage you have also . UPDATE : 7\/27\/2011 : well , it have be almost a full year -lrb- 10 month -rrb- since launch and I can say this game have see major improvement . it be still not quite there , but it be a much better game than what we first see . the market ward have a nice search feature , that include price . it will even place a icon next to the Retainers name so you can easily find they in the ward . Shopping be a much much more enjoyable experience now . I still think a ah style in the way of ffxus would be better -lrb- game would not have to load thousand of retaienr - obvious lag -rrb- . combat have have lot of improvement , most recently the removal of fatigue and stamen , and the addition of you time honor auto-attack . since stamen be remove you special skill now work off cool-down timer like you be use to from ffxus and other mmo 's . craft for local levequest be now much faster since it give you a repeat option . no more need to go through you menu every single time . it also remember that last few thing you have craft for quicker access . repair have be greatly simplify , a single material type be now need for every equipment type call dark matter . no more need to carry around , or find , several different type -lrb- for example cloth fent , tree branch , ore , metal , etc -rrb- to keep you armor and weapon in good shape . they have add nm and also have start add quest to the game that fall outside of the basic levequest the game start with . there be still very few of these though . you can tell from the patch note and the letter from the producer that they be put the framework in for questing hub like you 'll find in most popular MMO 's that will be a welcome addition . they have add the hub , but not the quest yet . they have also add two instanced dungeon -lrb- they call they raid , but I think that be a bit much for what they be -rrb- that require party to complete . I have decide to bump my review up a star to 4\/5 due to all they change they have make . the final star can be earn once they flesh out the quest to add content to keep it from be a mindless grindfest to level , and once they finally add alternative mode of transportation -lrb- airship and chocobo at a minimum -rrb- .

I have drive on the real world famous Nurburgring race track more time than I can count on my finger and compare to other game with the same track none of they scare I more like the real track then gtr 2 . I own all of the Grand Turismo and both of the forza motorsport and be really happy with this game . the only low be no street car and no after market part . but if you remember this game be base on gt series racing you 'll get over the fact that you favorite street car be not here . get a force feed wheel and get ready to sweet as you keep from wreck you ride .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I purchase this game after have be deceive by the hype -lrb- the realism -rrb- and I be very much disappointed ... to the point I will likely never purchase ANYTHING make by ea again . First of all , they have do away with prone completely . how many soldier refuse to `` hit the deck '' when they be under fire ? that be strike one against this supposedly realistic game . the mission game be too simple ... 4 hour to beat if you be a noobie . the graphic have problem -lrb- lot of tear -rrb- as well as the multi-player have severe spawn issue -lrb- they respawn you into the same place every time so sniper can rack up kill easily -rrb- . additionally , the server for the multi-player seem to crash all the time . then recently they make change to the game in which a full on , dead center mass shot from a sniper rifle will not kill , but only wind a player . additionally , you can shoot they in the head and we still do not have a confirm kill every time . save you money , wait for the next round of game to come out , and then rent they first to make sure they do not suck like this one do . I be not happy about be out the $ 60 and to tell you how bad it be , Gamestop as well as most other company have stop buy they back because they have so many sellback .

Video_Games	NEG	2	after play the game with my cousin and read the online review I would have to say that this game pretty much suck the big one .

I mean do not get I wrong , the graphic , the voice-over and the weapon be awesome . but , the end ? come on now , I save up big time to get this and have pre-order month in advance to receive the `` game of the year '' please ! the original , Halo , beat this one in to . also , I do not like playing between the Convenant and as Master Chief . pick one side and stick with it . they should make it like this : First play as Master Chief then after beat the game as a human give the option to play as the convenant or maybe ... the Flood . oh , Bungie , if you be read this : make a end that the gamer will like and not one the blow .
Video_Games	POS	5	the kid really love use this mic with the ps2 Karaoke game . Works well .
Video_Games	NEG	1	this game be great fun as long as you like make content and then watch it on screen . the game play be very simplistic . cell stage game play be a flash game with pretty graphic . creature stage be like Diablo but water down with very few ability and repetitive game play . Tribal and civ stage be akin to RTS game , but lack the depth and variety of game such as sin of a solar empire or warcraft 3 . space stage be basically the first few stage over and over but with a space ship throw in . this be say I really do like playing . create a creature\/building\/vehicle , and then watch it do its thing be very satisfying . bottom line , if you like goof off and play with spore like a toy its fun . however if you be look for a deep combat system , complex rt strategy develop , or think provoke game play this game be not for you . the simplistic game play couple with outrageous DRM and the ea sporepedium server be very buggy -lrb- will not upload some creature -rrb- , this game need lot of work to be a fun game . the editor be already fantastic . stage need to be flesh out with more abilities\/vehicles\/strategy \/ etc. .

Video_Games	NEG	1	bf3 be a very generic shooter with up-to-date graphic and sound . single player mode be simply junk , multi-player mode lack all the feature that make , for example , bf2 so much fun : shooter combine with great teamwork , tactic and strategy . single player : you be a actor play a very rigid and linear script . you be tell all the time what to do , there be nothing to explore , no choice on how to perform you task . you simply need to follow the step by step direction , until you die , at which point you restart from a few step back . actually you do have some liberty : you can choose the order in which you can kill the enemy present to you . I can recall many game from 20 year ago , that would fit on a single floppy disk and that be much more exit . multi-player : I will compare it mostly with bf2 : there be no more teamwork . not at squad level and certainly not at team level . there be no more voip in game . if you plan to hook up with some random people in the game and play and chat for a couple hour in a squad , bad luck . it will be just plain silent shooting , and wonder what the squad mate do and think . no easy way to communicate . all weapon work very well at long range - so everything become a matter of discover the adversary at long range in the very cluttered environment . if you move , you will almost certainly be kill by someone hide somewhere . the map be very large , which mean that unless you play long hour you will be continuously confuse by you location and where you killer might be . there be no more commander ! so no more unity as a team , no more direction and unify strategy - at least not easily if you join a random server . no more asset such as radar , artilery , UAV . the user interface : again bf2 be mile ahead , simple easy to use , instantly understandable . bf3 : clutter , annoy in short , save you money ! if you like Bad Company 2 you might like this one as well , but if you be a bf2 fan for the reason enumerate in the first paragraph , than bf3 will be a waste of money . real waste , since of course one can not resell the game - it will become tie to you ea origin account . I certainly regret order it in advance , instead of wait for the first unbiased review .
Video_Games	NEU	3	my kid like the collection of old game best . he only complaint be that there be a lot of the same game in the different collection . have be around to play many of these in the arcade the reproduction look pretty good . Wish they have PSP 's when I be a kid .
Video_Games	NEG	2	like most thing its good in theory , but not in practice . the game lag , the control be simply horrible on the pc version at least . I have high hope for this game after all they hype , but there be simply too much stop and go to progress the story along . even the patch be bug for the pc and will not complete the update . if this do turn into a mmorpg and the bug fix , it may deserve another look . for now I waste 50.00 on a subpar game .
Video_Games	NEG	2	after many frustrating attempt to install the power tool , I go to the Hasbro website and find out that you can only play the game with the mouse if you have Windows xp ... what a bummer this be to my six and four year old son . they still have fun play it with the mouse , but it be not they first choice . thankfully , I order this when it be 50 % off , or Tonka Joe would really be on my list !!
Video_Games	POS	4	this game be fun . it be certainly not a great game but it be a fun game for a 10 or so hour ride to get a platinum trophy . the No fear of Heights trophy be a pain in the ass and take I around 50 try but I finally get it . I hate trophy that be base on pure luck . it be b.s. however , when you get it you be totally pump with excitement . the gameplay be redundant and I find myself use the same combo for 90 % of the game . later in the game I mostly use the butt\/body bounce to weaken the enenmy then a quick slash to finish off the zombie . the boss be not difficult at all but this game go beyond the three time boss fight to win . one boss -lrb- Zed , I think -rrb- take like five time to hurt , then another four of 5 time to finish . Sheesh , that be aggravate . this game be rate mature 17 for a reason ... definitely not for kid -lrb- even though they probably already hear it all -rrb- . there be lot of sexual innuendo and Juliet be quite provocatively dress ... especially if you upgrade all costume -lrb- seashell bikini -rrb- . there be panty peek the entire game with one trophy be look up Juliet 's skirt . it be not gross or demeaning it be in the realm of a college party movie like Animal House or Porky 's . the game make I laugh out loud at a few point with the silly college humor . I would rate this game around a 7 or so because it be fun . it take at least two play through -lrb- or chapter select -rrb- to platinum . I have to do it a few more time because when gather up trophy and collectible after the initial play through , I should have play on rank mode . I do not figure that out till the second play through so I have to do all the rank chapter again . my bad . you live and you learn . in my opinion this be certainly not a $ 60 game . I would be a little peeved if i payed over $ 30 . I do , but then sell it and it wind out cost I around $ 11 . perfect !!! the game be break up with minus game which be just fill but mostly still enjoyable . during gameplay , try to be sure and hit all the correct button in the qte for collectible wrapper and extra gold coin . it be need for some trophy . one other trophy which at first be a pain be go medal racer . it be not that hard once you figure out a plan . when it come to the part that split left and right I stop , line up with the coin on the lower level right and bam ... one try get everything safely and avoid the fall building . after many try it be simple once I figure that part out . I be pretty sure you will enjoy this if you arent expect a top notch game like uncharted . it be light hearted , college fun that occupy you time for 10 + hour . Story be ok even though I really do not pay much attention . there be 6 chapter plus a prologue . there be no save besides auto save . in rank mode you must complete the entire chapter without get kill or you need to start from the beginning of the chapter . use you health -lrb- lollipop -rrb- and sparkle wisely and sparingly . I do not recommend start rank mode until you be comfortable with the controls\/game for this reason . you will be really upset if you get 43 minute in and then die . yes you will have to start all over . that sux . you need to learn combo for maximum point to beat Dad 's score in rank mode . it be not that hard once you get use to the game . I do recommend this game but wait until the price drop or buy it and then flip it on a auction site or here on Amazon . if you be not expect a whole lot you wont be disappoint . the soundtrack be also quite good so enjoy that also . have fun ...

Video_Games	POS	5	I buy this game out of a knee-jerk reaction-i think that burnout 3 be the best in the series and the new one due to come out look even better . Legends be basically a port of burnout 3 but with new game mode -lrb- I think it also have new car -rrb- . still , the game play great and be translate over to the psp flawlessly . all the mode you know and love be there , plus a new one , pursuit , which remind I of the relic nf mode where you be the cop chase the criminal . the graphic be awesome and be some of the best I have see so far , be so early in the lifespan of the psp . the control be easy to use , with the d-pad and analog stick be both available to use . d Braking and accelerate be not too wild , which I think be in NFS Underground rival . the car drive just like NFSU rival , so if you have play NFS , you will have no proplem adjust to the game . overall it be fun and will bring you fun in the middle of rush hour traffic that `` drive '' my parent crazy . for a port , this game do not really seem like one , just a brand new game itself .

Video_Games	NEG	1	I be 59 year old and have be use computer extensively for over 35 year . I buy the PS3 to play br disc and to watch Netflix . the PS3 user interface be horrible . I have to guess and use trial & error to try to use the unit . most all older Americans will never be able to use it . I be recommend to my friend to get a PS3 for Netflix . now I do not . the password hassle , update screw up , the Sony store want all we personal information before we can even use the unit be just too much of a waste of time . I go to the Sony website to get more operating instruction . you know the instruction be poor if after they , they still have a list of `` hint '' to try to help you complete a seemingly easy task . I think the PS3 be probably a good machine , but DOS be easier to use . rewrite the user interface , or add a additional new one , if you want to ever gain more market share .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I love Halo on the Xbox . truly the first or second best shooter on any platform . `` half life on the pc be the other contender '' . on my Multimedia super killer Dell wide screen notebook with the new Pentium m processor , Nvidia FX 5650 go Video with 128 mb video RAM and 1 gig of main memory , Halo performance be abysmal .  i figure the other who say this may have be a bit over the top . they werent ! for Microsoft to have release this piece of drek be irresponsible in the extreme . it be the full Halo game and if you set to the higher resolution , the scenery be gorgeous , but , but , but !  unfortunately , even with virtually all the pretty video feature turn off and resolution set down to a abysmal 800x600 , the massive frame rate -lrb- and motion update -rrb- slowing -lrb- to as bad as less than 1 frame per second -rrb- that take place whenever major scene motion occur -lrb- especially in the middle of gunfight and always during in battle reloading -rrb- . make the game practically unplayable . I complete Halo on the Xbox in normal and heroic mode . but the pc version in standard mode be go to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update be so bad . really , really bad .  there be thing that could have be do to fix these issue before release , but let face it with halo2 loom , Microsoft have to dump it out here now to have any chance of sell it at all . half Life work on the pc and have a truly excellent interface . they do use lower resolution figure and scenery , but the whole thing work together . halo on the pc be on the other end of that spectrum .  do NOT BUY THIS GAME , IT be AWFUL ! go out and buy a xbox and get Halo for it . xbox Halo , alone be worth buy a xbox for . the only thing of value in the pc version be the Box it come in .

Video_Games	NEG	1	the graphic and gameplay be absolutely stunning even on low . that if you can get to that part . this game be very hard to handle . during my time with this product I have encounter white screen of death -lrb- game freeze with a white screen -rrb- , key in use error and so much more . it be almost impossible to get to the good stuff . during the campaign at the end of the first mission i encounter a white screen which make I restart my computer . Them when i give up try to finish the campaign due to all the white screen i attempt multiplayer . that do not work out either . I try over 20 time to enter my game key on my ea account but apparently it be already in use . also because ea have horrible customer support for it be game i do not recomend this game for the pc . any other platform it work fine . I myself have play it on xbox360 and ps3 and it be incredible . for pc not so much especially with all the hassle i have to go through to get the game to work . I end up return my copy for pc . it be a waste of my time to attempt play this on the pc .
Video_Games	POS	5	this be one of the best game I have ever play . if you play the first Kingdom Hearts and think that be fun , wait until you play this one . it be amazing . the storyline be wonderful and keep you wonder how everything happen . the game start off slow and make you think the first one be better , but once you get pass the begin it get so much more fun than the first one . I definitely recommend play this .

Video_Games	NEG	1	the product appear well-built . it be far more advance than the 3d . the game , however , be another story . I regret buy this console . it be at home gathering dust . I should have wait until good game come out . so , my advice be not to buy this product just yet .
Video_Games	POS	5	Bethesda be notorious for well make open world game , though there be some bug ; the few I have run across be minor and not game breaking . buy skyrim , kiss you family goodbye and enter skyrim ...
Video_Games	POS	4	this game be awesome and if I would have actually pay full price for it ... it still would have be underprice in my opinion . obviously this be one of those game that if you not into rpg 's you might not like it , but at the same time if you simply new to RPG 's and enjoy fp ' then this be a great game for you to get start with . story : without spoil anything I will just say this . the story be well write and play out very nicely . also the freedom to sort of `` direct '' you conversation and certain action that you take make the replay value of this game fairly high . you can pursue a romantic interest with ally or keep it all professional . you have the chance to win over the loyalty of you teammate but you can fail and some of the situation 's that involve gain ally `` loyalty '' may cause you player reputation to look bad , but you have full control over the path you take . Gameplay : it may take some get use to , but it be very easy to learn the control . the player movement be pretty smooth imo and the aus -lrb- you ally -rrb- do a pretty decent job during combat situation . -lrb- some character be better than other but the longer the game go on the more ally you get to choose from -rrb- . overall I give this game a 4\/5 -lrb- really a 4.5 -rrb- instead of a 5 only because the character interaction get a little repetitive after a while . -lrb- during the game while not on a mission you can go talk to various character , but most usually repeat the same thing over and over again until you have complete certain mission -rrb- . would recommend this game to everyone who enjoy a good shooter and the fact that it be RPG make it better since the storyline be so extensive .
Video_Games	POS	5	there be a very thorough review for the Wii version of the game , so I take a chance that the d version would be as good for my two boy -lrb- 5 & 8 -rrb- . we just receive the game yesterday and so far they have have a lot of fun play it . the quest seem very simple -lrb- just go to the next place with the big yellow star -rrb- so even though my 5 year old can not read he can still do just fine with it . they start play it and then ask for some help , so I be not sure if they miss some of the clue or if there be better direction in the box , but it do take we a little while to figure out the strategy for gain new attack and how best to use strategy when fight the other dragon . my boy love modify character , so have a place to customize they dragon be great and they love simple battle game . from what I remember , the Wii review fit what we be see with the d version too . the only complaint they have have so far be that the multi-player seem to be just to battle each other , which I would have expect , and not to hep each other along on they quest . give the simple nature of the `` quest '' I do not think do it together would work , but that be a kid 's perspective . it be not like the detailed quest you do in Lego game like Star Wars or Indiana Jones , which they enjoy do together and have in mind for `` multiplayer '' experience .

Video_Games	NEU	3	edit - add one star due to additon of more hardcore game mode on Mulitplayer . it be still no mw though ... this game do seem like a step backwards from mw2 . the single player aspect do not keep I interested long enough to finish it , but most will buy this for the multiplayer anyway , and here 's my thought on it : GOOD : - commando\/lightweight be go , no more get knife as you be shoot someone - killstreak reward kill do not count towards next killstreak . - I like the purchasing system for weapons\/attachments etc. . but you still have to unlock the weapon by level - have not run into any glitching . nobody hiding in rock , under the ground , or float a mile in the sky -lrb- so far -rrb- - the ability to revive down team mate BAD : - lot of lagging and bad connection . my connection be fine on other game , so it be not just I ... - spawn system be terrible . Random enemy spawn directly behind you , no matter where you be - it take too many round to get a kill on core . damage threshold need to be lower a bit - there be not enough hardcore game mode -lrb- where be hardcore headquarters ?? -rrb- - sound be not very good at all . I should ` nt have to get shoot by a helicopter to notice that it be there . - dog unrealistically too hard to kill -lrb- especially on hardcore . I can kill a man with one shot but not a dog ? lol -rrb- - map be fairly small with not much for sniper to do . there should be at least a couple good snipe map . - no real incentive to prestige imo . not that I 'll put nearly the time into this as I do on mw\/mw2 I think it be a pity that this break the initial sale record for mw2 . it do ` nt deserve it . I hope they can patch some of the issue , but if mw3 be come out next week , I would dump this and move on .

Video_Games	POS	4	First off . yes you get a tutorial . the first hour or so be completely on training wheel , and after that hour you get introduce to new mechanic as they come up , complete with context pop up . tired of the abrupt manticore fight and dragon movie everytime you start a new character ? too bad . want to just skip all of it and start at the first riftstone ? too bad . already know how to issue command ? too bad , they be get explain again ? why ? tutorial ! every review I have read cries\/praises the lack of a turorial as if this game be somehow the deep end of the pool . sorry , it be there and the learning curve be not all that scary . this be not Demon 's soul . challenge level in combat feel about right for I . I be not get Amalur Carpal tunnel , nor be I boring my way through final Fantasy autocombat . there be not a lot of micromanage in combat , so unless you have some tandem move , the AI be go to take and keep control of you minion . you can configure you minion AI to a extent , though not on the fly . also , since it isnt list anywhere - you can change the vocation of you main character and main pawn , and change back to any unlock vocation with no lose progress . -lrb- if I max out my main pawn as a fighter , then change he to a wizard , he 'll go right back to be a max out fighter should I change he back -rrb- . the Pawn Mechanic be definately what set the game apart . you 'll learn new tactic from visit pawn , and you main pawn will benefit while in other people game . since visit pawn dont level up with you , you 'll need to continually shop around for the ` perfect ' pawn to accompany you . you can rate a pawn and gift the owner on the release of one , and it be do in a pretty complimentary manner . if you lack a internet connection , there be already a large number of pawn ingame for recruiting . the graphic be pretty solid , voice acting be ok . the story be not this big gripping epic , it be a backdrop to start you off and to eventually finish you with . everything that come between be standard wow quest fare . there be no real multiplayer to speak of , but you 'll need a internet connection to access the pawn create by other player , and the group effort fight like the Ur-Dragon . the camera like to hide you . . not nearly as much as Amalur , but it be there . the quest\/map interface be a little clunky , but still serviceable . it also autoformat into widescreen , so you may be stick with formatting bar .
Video_Games	POS	5	I hate halo until i actually play it !

Video_Games	POS	5	the early generation of controller be make of some kind of plasticy glossy slippery material , and it be a struggle to keep the controller in you hand , but this controller be different . it have like a matte finish which will fit firmly in you hand and when you be play aggressive game where you have to screw the analog stick ; like Street Fighter , Fifa , tekken . . etc , the controller will not slip out of you hand . I would definitely recommend this if you have and older dualshock 3 , because they have change alot since they first come out .

Video_Games	POS	5	remarkable as it be , Naughty Dog have not have a single game that one would call `` terrible '' . while some be consider more worthwhile then other , they track record be pretty impressive . with the release of Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune , the team develop a beautiful and fun if a tad derivative game that help encourage the more `` cinematic '' approach to game design . then enter uncharted 2 : among thief . practically a seminal milestone in gaming , beat the game and run into somebody who have not play it yet prompt a `` oh man , you have gotta play it ! '' reaction . stunning graphic with believable motion capture , excellent voice act with some truly stellar set-piece , I would almost go and say uncharted 2 nary have a single fault in its narrative -lrb- other than blue cat people but I digress -rrb- . which make walk into the 3rd game , Drake 's Deception , kind of a tricky situation I be sure not only for fan but for the team . will they try to outdo everything the 2nd game do ? can you really outperform `` perfection '' ? well uncharted 3 be kind of in the middle : it do nearly everything the 2nd game do but better and yet can still leave one with a feeling of deja vu , albeit a impressive deja vu . 2 year after the event of among thief , the game open with Drake and Sully attempt to solve a riddle from one of Sir Francis Drake 's voyage , a voyage believe to end with the city of Ubar , the iram of the Pillars or the `` Atlantis of the Sands '' . Drake globetrot from the London underground to a chateau in France to the arabian desert as he search for this mystical city , all the while friend around they be question why be it that he always pursue reckless endeavor for treasure and do not see how it affect he friend and love one . the leap from the first game to the second be pretty extraordinary and not just on a graphical front . the seamless transition of cinematic , gameplay and even event that would have likely be quicktime event or non-interactive be something to behold . that leap to this game be not as grand a leap since now we pretty much know what Naughty Dog be capable of and while what you be see will not have the `` oh my god , how do they even do this ? '' reaction , it be still mighty impressive stuff . a ship capsizing , a burning chateau and a plane get rip apart ... with you in it be set-piece that really make uncharted 3 one of the more visceral and entertaining blockbuster ride of 2011 . although one could think the team just put these moment in there know people would look for they so they build excuse in the story to have they , you can not deny these be magnificent part of the game . however , for a game highly dependent on a script and precise order of event , it be very disheartening when you end up die because you do not turn a corner fast enough or miss a jump or do not know what way to go during a chase sequence . it make for a odd dichotomy since to further the `` it be like a movie '' feel of a uncharted game , one must rarely die to preserve its flow and yet without prior knowledge of what exactly need to be do , it can make for a very start\/stop kind of structure . also oddly out of place be that unlike the near flawless pacing of among thief , it be very bizarre to say some part in Drake 's Deception just flat out ... , well they kind of suck . a syrian fortress and a slow beginning as well as certain story element that be never address or properly resolve make I think the game be rewrite a couple of time and certain part get lose in the shuffle . that still do not mean the game do not have incredible high -lrb- see precede paragraph -rrb- but the low be strangely very low . also , the amount of punishment Drake take be kind of ridiculous . how can a guy go this long without crack a rib , break he finger or he leg . I mean seriously , dude 's like x-man 's Colossus . hell , even the going-on 60 Sully can keep up with the youthful Drake . but still , if there be one thing you can not knock the team for be presentation and this game be a stunner . other than one wonky wall texture , everything in the game from the mo-cap to the environment and of course the set-piece , uncharted 3 practically bleed production value . Voice act as usual be strong and character be appropriately endearing or love-to-hate-them -lrb- but why do Elena and Chloe look worse than before ? must be the eye -rrb- . the environment be also incredibly gorgeous , whether they be be destroy or not , and some I be sure be incredibly difficult to pull off despite the look of the scene . if there be one thing that uncharted 3 occasionally but not always handle be in the combat which can be strangely frustrating at time . some of they just drag for too long and even though stealth be encourage , be catch do not mean about 10 or so guy , it become a long protracted and tedious firefight as enemy spawn with sniper , grenade launcher and rpg 's lead to many out-of-the-blue death . and this be a common issue among they forum but the aim feel ... off which be quite noticeable when I actually replay among thief before I get this to re-accustom myself to Uncharted 's gameplay . this also can lead to the `` start\/stop '' structure I mention before where I can really imagine specific sequence annoying gamer on higher difficulty know what a trial they be even on normal . bring back from uncharted 2 be the online mode , the co-op and the multiplayer . in the co-op , it break down into 3 group : Arena , which play out similarly to Horde mode with the twist be that every wave will have a specific objective such as kill only count when stand in a area or `` Gold Rush '' which be straight up capture the Flag . there be co-op adventure which have you and 2 player -lrb- with strangely downgrade graphic on the character model -rrb- go through a little mini-story that be about half hour long or so . then there be the new mode , co-op Hunter which have 2 team of 2 compete to capture treasure with the villain side gain some computer AI buddy for assistance . since all money\/xp accumulate go towards you online profile , you can jump into co-op or the actual online to better you character 's unlock . and the actual multiplayer of uncharted be indeed kind of a blast . the same basic rule apply : 5 versus 5 , jump and climb anywhere you want while you attempt to capture treasure or just straight tdm , free for all , hardcore -lrb- no weapon mod or medal kickback -rrb- . some new element be introduce such as medal kickback which function but do not become acquire the same way as killstreak . choose one kickback , once a certain amount of medal be obtain , press up on the d-pad activate a certain ability such as instantly spawn a rpg in-hand , run faster for a brief time as well as many other . booster -lrb- or essentially perk -rrb- return while weapon mod be add so you can customize a gun to have faster reload , bigger clip or a `` call out '' which highlight enemy name when they be be aim at so other player can know where they be . also a new element be what be call `` power play '' so say the lose team be lose by ... a lot , a power play be bring in to hopefully give that team a chance to catch up . one thing to note be that the game do have a online pass which do NOT include a trial mode to test out the multiplayer so if you be rent the game and you want to test the online and see whether you would rather buy this then the other big online game out , you be SOL . buy it brand new or pay 10 more buck . remarkable and highly impressive with the occasional blemish , uncharted 3 be indeed a great game . the thrill be more impressive albeit familiar but unfortunately this game come after a even better one and while this game I would recommend someone play without hesitation , it be not the flawless roller-coaster ride as its predecessor .

Video_Games	POS	5	a beautiful , antique carousel be mysteriously start up in the dead of night . be it a ghost ... or be it more then it seem ? in this adorable adventure star you as teen sleuth Nancy Drew , you explore Captin 's Cove , a amusement park in New Jersey suffer from a few ... problem .  as you move throughout the park , you will have to solve various puzzle to advance deeper into the game . sometimes , it will only take a phone call to dig up a clue , but other time , you will have to do thing like decipher shorthand write to advance -lrb- do not worry , you 'll have plenty of help -rrb- .  to warn veteran player , some thing have change in this installment . this time around , you have e-mail and a cell phone to aid you with you case . you will be able to use this cell phone anywhere but , unlike the other game , you will have to depend on it a lot more .  i think that the 7 location in this game be well think out and plan . the same thing go for the 4 main character , who , as you interrogate they , will all have a motive and all seem like they be the culprit . the music , though somewhat scary at time , only add to the overall flavor of the game .  though it only take I 1 day to complete , I think it be great ! if you be a parent you will also love it . unlike some of the other computer game out on the market , this one let you kid have fun , while they learn .  the only complaint I have about Nancy Drew and the Hanuted Carousel be that it be too short , I guess time fly when you have fun !
Video_Games	NEU	3	the program , for what it actually be design to do be easy to use and fun as a toy . I may look into get a microphone for my kid to play around with , as I be now stick with the software . the advertisement , however , state user could edit they `` own unique song '' . I take this to mean I could use music I already own on CD 's , which be what I need . this program will not allow the user to import anything . the `` song '' create with this program be mostly percussion .
Video_Games	POS	4	call of duty black op be the 5th cod installment for the PS3 . while it have its moment of great fun and entertainment , it just seem to be lack a little bit when compare to the Modern Warfare game . while I have hear mixed opinion of the game , from its lack in graphic compare to MW to the enjoyment of a older war -lrb- but not WWII old -rrb- , I be not sure what to expect . after play the game through on single player , I find all of the aforementioned statement to be accurate . the time frame be great . while I love the MW game , and will always enjoy a good WWII game , it be nice to be able to play a game set during lesser covered war and time period . this time open the door for different weaponry , both arms\/chemical weapon and military grade vehicle , as well as differ approach to historical event and method of interrogation . all of these area be welcome in a market that have be quickly saturate with fp military game . the game be graphically sound . sure it be not up to par with mw , but do all game really need to be ? the entertainment factor more than make up for what be very good graphic any way . character , weaponry , and environment all have great detail . the game 's biggest downfall , in my opinion , be the fact that it take place through memory during a less-than-friendly interrogation conduct by unknown person . this be exactly what ea 's battlefield 3 have do more recently . it be not the past tense time frame that bother I but rather the interrogation between each level . it be very repetitive and between catch the player off-guard in the begin to deliver a shocking ending , it become little more than a dull load-time in the middle . overall , this be a good game . if you be a single player person and do not have any cod yet , I would suggest MW 1 and\/or 2 . if you be online focus , this be probably a better choice as it be newer . either way , it be worth playing .
Video_Games	NEG	1	a great look game . Moody . atmospheric . Creepy . unfortunately the pc version be so riddled with bug and lockup that it be almost unplayable ... save you money or at least wait until the manufacturer come out with a patch .
Video_Games	POS	5	the Sims and they expansion be grate . i love the Sims , its soo much fun . its also grate fro kid because it can teach they about money and romance and all that grate stuff . I rate this a perfect 5 !
Video_Games	POS	5	I be skeptical at first , shell out $ 20 just to go from 480i to 480p , but it totally make a difference , even on a full 1080p tv . we run comparison back to back to back with both cable , and the difference be definitely noticeable . color be truer , far less pixelation , just overall much better .
Video_Games	POS	4	I have really enjoy this game . a comic fan at heart , I be impressed with the world that have be create and get to see and work with the hero and villian of the DCU . character generation be simple enough to be easy , but with enough choice to get a original look . the only downside be the control . this game be design with pc and console game in mind , so some of the control take a bit of time to get use to . but once learn , thing go smoothly . I would encourage people to give it a try .
Video_Games	POS	5	this game be great . plain out . the way you can switch from human to elite on certain level be very cool . ! part I do not like be the fact that i will have to wait more , through delay after delay and finally get to save earth . I hope they dont change the weapon because master chief be on go for a day or two . overall the game be great and the multus player be fantastic and i could play that with my friend all day and all night .
Video_Games	POS	5	I buy this along with a DSI for my wife and I find myself use it whenever she put it down . be in we 50 's we remember Mario in the 1980 's . back then we spend many a night play mario , well dejavue all over again . we love it and it be a must if you own a DSI .
Video_Games	POS	5	ok before I start on the game , I will address this ` lagging ' issue . the only time this have happen to I be if I have be play for a while -lrb- lazy Saturday , woman not around , 6 hour in -rrb- and typically get choppy in a town . but you know what , I probably should not be play 6 hour straight anyways , but that be my problem now be not it ? my file be around 11mb and I have 100 hour of game time -lrb- yes , I be that awesome -rrb- . so I be not sure why everyone have give this 1 star . now , that be address ... endless fun . seriously , endless . I have not even explore everywhere yet . and when I plan on do a mission\/quest I end up get side-track when I come across a abandon keep or bump into someone who need help . for every quest I finish I have add 3 more . and they be the typical ` fetch ' quest either . the story be immersive as be each side quest . and these side quest be not straight forward . I ` read ' a random book at the beginning of the game and only just complete it , 100 hour later . I do not have the best armor\/weapons\/spells , I do not have all the shout , and I be not even max out on level up . the graphic be incredible too . as be the gameplay , dialogue\/sound effect , lighting . of course , with any game like this -lrb- or really in general -rrb- load be a bit tedious . so while all the above-mentioned make for a incredible gaming experience , have to load so much get a tad annoying . but whatever , I be a patient guy and it be worth it . it really be unfortunate that so many people give it 1 star base upon a lagging issue -lrb- which I believe be real and I be sure one of the two patch I have have address this and other will continue to in the future -rrb- . I have only come across a couple minor glitch and for a game with such scale that be quite impressive . I 'll continue to support Bethesda as they rarely disappoint . if you can get past the ` lagging ' complaint you will find yourself with the best game of the year -lrb- yes , that be include Modern Warfare ... stupid over rate fpss -rrb- . lastly , it be rare that a game come out that be truly one player . call I a loner , but I find most gaming better alone , make a personal experience , like read a book series ... uhhh but with button instead of word . Ok , that be enough babbling . I hope you consider Skyrim if you have not already . if not , whatever , I do .
Video_Games	POS	5	I have be play computer\/video game since 1980 , a long time . in that time I have go through all the console -lrb- except the turbo grafix 16 -rrb- and play ton of computer game . halo and halo 2 be great game . in both , there be thing to dislike . the first be too short and the level repeat . in the second the field of view seem a bit too tight . this game be great , it look great and run very fluidly . the game have perhaps the most annoying end ever for a game -lrb- it make I want to burn bungie studio down -rrb- . it have much better level design , and the ability to finally get to play as a elite . I have spend thousand of hour play Halo at LAN party with my friend and be have one -lrb- my first -rrb- for Halo 2 on Dec 4th . if you be in the Lacey area , drop I a line and swing on by . the multiplayer option for live need work , badly , but the game be so much fun to play with other that I can live with they . lot of people , especially fan boy for other system be go to bash the game , but if you have a xbox and like FPS game , then give Halo 2 a whirl . see you online , right before I kill you gamertag munkeeone feel free to add I to you friend list .
Video_Games	POS	4	I get this game after purchase and become adicted to Pharoah . c iii be as fun as pharoah . however , you must be a little more careful about fire and the colapse of building in c-iii .  game be very similar to Pharoah of course , but do not matter . the graphic be good and the quality of game play be also just as good .  the scenario be not nearly as difficult as ol Pharoah , but still I enjoy this game very much .
Video_Games	POS	4	when I first start it be way easy , but I still like it . my favorite part be when we can dress she , do hair , make-up and nail . I love to watch the movie at the end that show how they look . I be 5 and I have plave this game a lot ! -lrb- type by mom -rrb-
Video_Games	POS	5	how many time I have buy these set seperately I can not say . it be many . now you get get all the infinity engine game in one shot for 20 buck . Hope it all work right technically with you os . it be the only thing I would be wary of . the game be legendary and need no review , Biowares entire reputation be root in its achievement with the infinity engine and Baldur 's gate 2 : shadow of Amn specifically . they have go on to build some pretty powerful franchise but Baldur 's gate 2 have no equal -lrb- or successor -rrb- in gaming . it be the Mona Lisa , of PCRPG 's and that that . unlike the NWN set , this set be `` complete '' but you still will have to mod the game to get the most out of they . I would never play these straight out of the box anymore . perhaps Bioware get too much credit and the modding community deserve a little bit more , for the spit and polish at least .
Video_Games	POS	5	ok , we all know how ! awesome ! this system be ! its a mp3 player , mini movie player , game system , photo holder , its all anybody could ever want ! its look be sleek , smooth , and H.O.T. !!! the screen be better than anything , its get about 16.77 million color , the display be amazing . sure , its a `` handheld '' device , but really , its much , much more ! it be truly a all in one entertainment system that can fit in the palm of you hand . oh yea ! i forget , it can also surf the internet ! but here be the one problem , it be way expensive . i buy the system core , a memmory card -lrb- recomended 2gb -rrb- the playgear protect pocket -lrb- a must have to keep you psp safe -rrb- a car charger -lrb- for raod trip -rrb- a battery charger , one game -lrb- socom -rrb- , the Wifi connector -lrb- to use the internet , not a must have , but awesome if you have one -rrb- and it come to the amount of about $ 350 dollaar , that be ALOT ! but really , in the end , it be worth it .
Video_Games	NEG	1	not really a lot to say here . the graphic be actually spectacular . that be why it get the one star . the game itself be utter nonsense and absolute crap . I have see people get through it in as little as a bit over a hour , I take my time and get 3 out of it . nothing really here at all to offer to anyone who be a fan of drive game , unless you like the walmart arcade racer in the arcade area . then this would be right up you alley . the physics , as with all NFS game since ... the first few original , be absolutely ridiculous . the car themselves be gorgeous , but behave nothing like car . ea gamble it be entire game on be the only one to offer Porsches , due to a contract game like Forza 4 , be not allow to use Porsches . well , this strategy be a absolute , utter failure . it will never compete with game like Forza 3 or 4 , or Gran Turismo . I can not imagine it be really mean to though , it feel like they spend all of about 5 minute develop it . I suppose I be a bit harsh . I just like my drive game to feel like I be actually drive something . honestly , any drive game without a interior view automatically lose all star . this game have no real story , no real substance to it , but like I say , graphically it be honestly pretty awesome . as for judge if you should buy it or not , go to you local walmart , play one of those `` fast and the furious '' arcade game . if you like it , this be for you . if you be look for anything resemble actual driving , do not bother , honestly . at least not at the price it be be sell for now . when it drop to the 5 dollar value box , or if you be go to rent it , go for it . mercifully , I be smart enough to play before buying . do the world a favor and do not give ea or black Box any of you money . let evolution take it be course .
Video_Games	POS	5	I have play all of the Nancy Drew game , and to I , treasure in a Royal Tower be by far , the best one . in this game , Nancy Drew , 18 year old super-slueth , visit Wickford Castle and Ski Resort for a winter vacation . but when a terrible blizzard keep she and 4 other guest strand there , a mystery turn up . someone have ransack the library , and one guest claim a item of value of hers have be steal . I would not reccomend this game for people who have not play other Nancy Drew game , because the castle be very confusing -lrb- I get lose a bunch of time ! -rrb- , but all in all , this game rock !
Video_Games	NEG	1	this game have mad system requirement . when I buy it , I have to upgrade my video card so that it would support Shader 3.0 -lrb- the game doesnt look that fine trust I , it would have run on 2.0 perfectly , developer be just alienate 2.0 user -rrb- . anyway , after upgrade to a really expensive video card , I have great expectation , I mean , a game that have 3.0 shader as a minimum system requirement have to look awesome right ? well no , it look exactly like any other game I ever play on my 2.0 Shader card . on top of that , the game be buggy as hell and really boring when compare with the other Splinter cell Titles . my final recommendation ? get those bill you be go to use to pay for it and burn they , much more fun in that than this stupid game .
Video_Games	POS	4	I have all my electronics hide in a closet . in the summer the heat from the electronics make the closet maybe 20 deg hotter than ambient . I have hear about issue with PS3 's overheating , so i think a fan be a good idea . this unit plug in easily . the fan turn on when you have the PS3 on , and off when PS3 in standby mode . the fan be a little loud ; even more than this they seem to pull the internal fan out of balance . when the PS3 first start up with these fan go , you hear a harmonic vibration from the internal fan . this go away after maybe 45 seconds , then it be just a little louder than normal . when I do not turn on the accy fan , the harmonic vibration do not happen . I feel the extra air movement be enough to increase the lifespan of my PS3 . I be happy with the purchase .
Video_Games	POS	5	we buy the Wii package for we adult daughter as a Christmas gift . she be thrill and have already wear out two battery . the package arrive in good time and in good condition .
