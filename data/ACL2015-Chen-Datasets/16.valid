Bag	POS	4	if you want a basic camera that can zoom and have multiple auto-everything feature , this little film camera may be good for you . it be easy for I to carry around when I do not have room for a slr -lrb- single lens reflex -rrb- camera . take decent picture with 400 iso film , but light need to be pretty darn good daylight lighting for the pix to look swell . since purchase this little baby , Minolta go out of the camera business in the mid 2000s . the Freedom zoom 160 come out , I believe , in 2002 , one of the last film point & shoot camera . now I have a digital point & shoot with video capability and a Pentax K-x DSLR that I use for serious photography . but for a back-up camera , the Minolta can not be beat .
Bag	POS	4	well , like my title say , this bag be perfect for my little Fuji digital . I be able to throw in 2 set of battery in the side pocket , carry my wallet and cell in the front zip , the camera in the middle , and a extra memory card .  my only complaint about this bag be the lack of stability in the middle . unless you very careful , with a lot of bumping , I think the camera would get damage = not a good thing . but overall , if you need a quick , down and dirty bag , this be pretty darn good . for the money , it be worth it .
Bag	POS	4	for the extension cord , this replace the rip shopping bag I have be pile they into . it also keep they cleaner and encourage you to roll they properly ... once that be do , it be painfully obvious . for those of you with jumper cable float around the back of the truck , this solve that a give you a clean , safe and memorable place for the flashlight , etc. .  great practical gift that nobody have and everyone will appreciate .
Bag	POS	4	this camera bag be great . it be big enough to hold 2 body , and several lens ; yet the bag remain light weight . it also have plenty of storage compartment for extra gear and film .
Bag	POS	5	not quite as big as I expect it to be , I almost wish i would have shell out the extra buck for the pro 12 to get a little extra comfort room in the big internal pouch . but , I do not think it would have be worth it a extra $ 40-50 for that little extra room . nevertheless this be a excellent bag and it be actually probably better that I go with the pro 8 instead of the 12 . it be big enough to fit it all , but small enough to carry it around everywhere and not be too much . this bag be definitely well build and durable , ready to take on the winter month come up with its total coverage top , 4 clip , a zipper and velcro to keep the top secure . the inside be nice with the divider and ton of velcro for maximum personalization to any gear you have . ton of pouch , pocket and slot for all that little stuff from memory card slot to cable , cord , cell phone or anything you can think of . so in this nice roomy little bag I manage to fit : - Stroboframe bracket -lrb- tight fit tho -rrb- - Olympus E-510 Dslr w \/ 14-42mm and hood attach -lrb- and strap -rrb- - Canon rebel 2000 film slr w \/ 28-80mm attach -lrb- and strap -rrb- -40 -150 mm lens w \/ hood - fl-50 ttl flash -2 nd manual flash - Portable Hard drive -1 Wireless flash trigger and 2 receiver - cable and cord - memory card , film and any other little thing like lens cap . - small tripod - plus plenty of room for little stuff leave in the pocket and pouch the only thing I have find be that this bag be slightly different from the description in that they must have come out with a newer model that do not have the detachable film bag , but do have red flag for memory card slot , check the Tamrac site for the correct version\/photo . overall it be a excellent bag and I be very pleased with it .
Bag	POS	4	Works on the deck great with 36 grit paper . however , the dustless feature seem to have be ommit in the one I receive . borrow a Porter Cable with a more effective collection system and in retrospect think the more expensive Bosch would have be a better investment . otherwise easy machine , good value .
Bag	NEU	3	the bag be make of heavy rip-stop nylon that will probably outlast I . I do not use this professionally , but I always have a lot of project in my `` off '' hour . the bag have many nice pocket -lrb- though I do not find they very useful in practice -rrb- and a sturdy zipper . the big downside be that there be no stiff bottom in this bag , unlike every other bag I have use . tool all slump to a heap in the center . I 'll cut my own , but I should not have to . a minor complaint be that the handle be just a nylon strap . I much prefer the feel of the nylon strap on the ` ridgid ' brand bag which have a stiff cord in the strap . hard to describe , but it be a nice feel . Ridgid have a nice 22 '' and a nice 17 '' . if you like a small bag , Stanley have a nice 12 '' .
Bag	POS	5	Great little camera bag for the Pentax EI-200 & HP-618i . have a tough time find a camera bag that meet my need , and the Lowepro website do a fantastic job of provide a list of compatible camera for each bag . check it out !
Bag	POS	5	this spacious tool bag be wonderful and so roomy that I wish I have buy two of they . I definitely recommend this tool bag .
Bag	POS	5	one year of very hard use and it be just as good as new ... just have a whole lot of character mark now . I be back to buy another , really like the soft bag for my tool . if it can take a year of my daily abuse , it be a great bag . .
Bag	POS	5	before I retire , I use one of these in my job for many year . the material for the bag be super-tough Cordura nylon . externally , the many different size pocket neatly store the most used tool for quick access , while internally , the bag have more vary size pocket on both side and on the end , keep all the tool require by electrical or mechanical tech organize and neat for ready access . the size of the bag be just right , IMO , for technician keep mechanical and electrical system in good work order . meter and other misc tool go in the center of the bag , and it be not heavy at all when fill . this bag become standard issue for all the other tech in the plant , it be fit and function perfect for we job . Quality be top notch . so it stand to reason that when I retire , I buy a new one for home use , it be a attachment I can not do without . there be a smaller one , but it be too small for the various tool and meter require by electromechanical technician , and the next size up , while have the same organizational attribute , become too heavy and bulky for people walk to problem in a manufacturing environment . it be the perfect size in we opinion .
Bag	POS	5	not too big , not too small ... just the right size for my dslr , a rather large flash , three extra battery and memory card , and three lens . the bag be well design to protect you camera against rain and bumping . the camera body with lens attach be design to sit on the left side center with the lens run down the middle - the bag 's design be flexible enough to support short stubby lens or the longer telephoto lens . there be two accessory pouch with one up front for battery and memory card and the other up on the cover for anything else . I put my cable , tool , and cleaning cloth up there . the top secure with three rather large strap clip and it come with a nice shoulder strap . there be strap on the left and right which accept accessory pouch from the Tamrac MX line . the fit and finish seem top rate and worthy of year and year worth of service .
Bag	POS	4	this bag seem well construct and look like it will last awhile . the Pentax K100D Super w\/18 -55 mm lens fit fine and the storage pouch will fit extra battery , memory card and some lens filter & clean item perhaps . will not take much more than that . I would like to have see a little more padding throughout but I be very pleased with it anyway .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be so great , I already love it . it be great for carry stuff between work and home , perfect for travel , too . it be strong and sturdy enough to withstand the rigor of everyday use , but it look hip and go with everything . how do I ever manage without my Amazon messenger bag ?
Bag	POS	4	this bag hold my Nikon d40 with 18-55 DX lens with room for a handful of accessory -lrb- battery charger + spare battery and power cord ; usb cable ; lens\/body cap ; uv filter case -rrb- . I find it difficult to position the padding perfectly for the d40 , so the divider do not quite cradle the camera . however , all of the accessory that I find some need for have when I be not at home fit just fine in the bag , and none of the pocket be completely fill . also , there do not seem to be a perfect corner for tuck in the neck strap - I always end up folding it in some wierd position . I do not see much of a good way to fit another lens inside - but hopefully by the time I can afford more glass , I 'll have enough cash for a slightly larger bag too . I have not have a oppurtunity to test the aw -lrb- all weather -rrb- cover yet . however , while not in use , you can barely tell it exist . for soem reason , the price go up since I buy it - it be $ 18.33 at the time of purchase , but two week later , it be go for $ 23.40 . also , I do not see why other color be more expensive - the black one be about ten buck more .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this so that I could put the most commonly use tool I have in one easy to pick up and go container . Works like a charm . I want to buy another Bucket Boss , so that I can store all my most frequently use part -lrb- screw , razor blade , nut , bolt , etc. -rrb-
Bag	POS	5	I give my dad one of these a year ago , and he have give it a workout . I think the company must have read the earlier review , and improve the strength of the bag . Dad have overload he with drill , etc. , and carry it everyplace , and it be show no sign of wear . he be so hard to buy for , it be great to see he thoroughly enjoy it . I be look for something similar but smaller to give he this year for he smaller item .
Bag	NEU	3	as mention in another review , the bag be a good bag . it be lighter than the McGuire Nicholas 24 '' bag , but it have only 3 covered pocket . first , the bag be a good bag . quite large . see product description for actual measurement . it have 3 covered exterior pocket with velcro secure they . 3 open fact pocket on the other side . on the interior , there be pocket on only one side , and they be flat-sewn to the backing . there be no bellowing or gusset . second , compare to the Mcguire 24 '' comparable model , the bucket boss be a little smaller , but lighter . the biggest difference be that the McGuire have more and larger interior pocket , 3 more covered exterior pocket , and be 10 $ cheaper .
Bag	POS	5	I have be use the dust bag for a week now and it work . be it a dust elimination system , no. . but it do cut down on my clean up by 95 % . not bad for a $ 13 item . I could not see run my table see without it .
Bag	NEU	3	fine bag . hold my Olympus d-460 -lrb- and manual -rrb- , 4 extra smart card , 8 aa battery , my kodak photolife k1000 aa battery charge kit , various cable , and FlashPath 3.5 ' floppy adaptor with ease .
Bag	POS	5	well finish , balanced , beauty ... a very very nice camera bag . I be not fond of back-pack or kangaroo pouch for carry my photo gear . I prefer the classic , standard , shoulder-hanged bag . I particularly feel this one as a very safe and rugged one . you 'll find enough space in it to accomodate body , lens , flash , and several minor gadget . side-slip pocket be a real hit , very handy indeed .
Bag	POS	4	I live in NYC and have a ton of gadget , very hard to find in a regular bag . THis be pretty cool , since you kinda compartmentize everything and its convenient to find the stuff you need .
Bag	POS	5	I go to a few privately own camera store -- very overpriced for what they be offer . the Samsonite camera bag be tough , durable , and SPACIOUS . I carry a flash , two lens , along with my canon elan 7 , and I have ton of room to grow , which be what I want . very reasonably price and well-made . I be pleased with my purchase .
Bag	POS	4	I be really hope this bag would help collect some of my sawdust . after a week of use it about two inch of dust have accumulate in the bag . actually most of the dust blow out of every other opening in my bosch saw . the bag seem to catch bigger shaving . I have not be saw any mdf or fine dust produce material so it may help more with those . the problem seem that all the shaving keep clog up in my dust port . on the plus side the bag have a squeeze clamp on it so it will work on just about anything .
Bag	POS	5	this bag do just what I need - clean up my trunk . I have cable , fix-a-flat , screwdriver and everything else roll around in my car and stash where I could fit they -lrb- but still could not be find when need -rrb- . now everything fit in this bag and look great . I be go to get one for my other car . highly recommend .
Bag	NEU	3	I guess the product do exactly what it say . it hold jumper cable . and that be it . I be hope to have some extra space in the bag to put other thing , and make use of the little front pocket , but it really be too small to be of much use . but as a bag to put jumper cable in , it work great . just like a plastic bag from WalMart would . get it on sale , and maybe it be worth it . otherwise , I would pass on this .
Bag	POS	5	I have use this model sander for year and like it because it be light weight , powerful , and do not wear you out like a heavier sander . its handle be arrange to give it a low center of gravity . this make it easier to control . the graphite impregnate friction pad that the belt run over be readily available from Bosch , be inexpensive and very easy to change . this product arrive as promise and be well package to prevent damage in shipping .
Bag	POS	5	I already have the smaller version of this bag but it be time to move up a little . I have a larger Tamrac backpack bag I use everyday , but do not have room for my `` strobist '' gear . I can fit 4 sb900 speedlight with some smaller modifier plus a few Justin clamp in the bag , along with a few other odds and end . I toss this in the back seat of my truck to have what I need in a hurry without weigh down my regular bag , kind of a second bag for I . I be not fond of a regular bag for everyday use , much prefer my backpack style bag . my only complaint be that I wish it be bigger , but that be my mistake in order , not they fault .
Bag	POS	5	nice leather ! really soft ! even so you use DSLR , you can place it easyly . I love it !!
Bag	POS	5	this thing be great , and be less than half the price of a bag that Sony be sell with my camcorder . fit my dcr-sr300 perfectly with all its accessory . save yourself a few buck and go with Samsonite .
Bag	POS	5	this camera bag be a must have !!! it be roomy and very well design . highly recommend !!!
Bag	POS	5	I use this bag to house my Dewalt D51822 clip Head Framing nailer . other have complain about how they nailer fit in this bag , but my Dewalt fit great with a little room to spare . the material be strong and do not seem like it will rip , tear , or fray easily . the zipper and other hardware ar extremely tough and will probably last a life time . the bottom of the bag be semi-rigid and offer extra protection when it be place on the ground .
Bag	POS	5	this be the best camera bag I have purchase , especially since it have the quality of any other Case Logic product , superb !  i own a old Toshiba pdrm1 digital camera , and in this neat little bag , there be a protected pouch for the camera , two storage area for digital media , and a storage for 4-aa -lrb- or aaa -rrb- battery .  I think this bag be super convenient , since I can carry my extra SmartMedia card and spare 4-aa battery . the size of the bag be small enough to fit in my travel bag , but yet , have a lot of storage space for all the necessity of a digital camera .  i highly recommend for a small digital camera like my Toshiba pdrm1 . dimension of my camera : 4-3\/4 '' long by 3-1\/4 '' high by 1-1\/2 '' deep . this camera be a perfect fit for this particular bag .
Bag	POS	5	it be good and very easy to handle ! you can put anything from a pda to a camera in it ! it also look nice and be protective of what be inside . the Koskin look also a lot like leather and be a investment well spend .
Bag	POS	5	I be unsure that this case would fit my Sony Mavica fd90 because the only dimension I could find be a little smaller than the camera . I order it anyway as a carry case for the camera and a few floppy just on short trip , instead of the case in which I carry all the cable , battery charger , etc. . this case be perfect even if a little snug because of the lens protrude . the inside pocket give great protection for the camera , and the zip-down front be perfect for the floppy , and maybe even a extra battery ... or a personal item or two . I be glad I trust -lrb- the website -rrb- ... to come through again . they be right as always .
Bag	POS	5	-lrb- this be a update to the review I post below . after several month of use , I be have a problem with the waste port ... the path that clear the dust from the surface to the bag . basically , it be get clogged and while this do not prevent the sander from work , it do prevent dust collection . clean the port be a pain , I have to disassemble the motor cover and use a very small screwdriver to push the clog out . -rrb-  i really like this sander , but I can not comment on long term durability as I have only use it for about a month . nonetheless , Bosch 's reputation for build high quality power tool be pretty solid .  the belt alignment on this be pretty much maintenance free , I have not have to adjust it yet . the overall design be outstanding , easy to use with one hand when you need to , and have good grip for when you need to bear down .  the other aspect of the design that be top be that you can easily get into tight spot . the motor housing do not extend past the right side of the sander . the variable speed switch be nice , and it have a wheel to modulate the top speed -lrb- a higher speed would be nice , I think this be 1,400 feet\/sec -rrb- .  the sander really be `` almost dust free '' , just depend on what you be sand . the dust bag be the only negative , it be small and need to be empty a lot . but after look at it , it probably would not be a big deal to retrofit another bag .  Bosch 's 4x24 sander be also really nice , but it weigh 14 lb . the 3x21 sander be perfect for most job .
Bag	POS	4	I own a Sony Digital8 camera , and this bag hold it perfectly . it be well-constructed , and the pocket hold extra tape and battery , wire , etc. , with some room to spare . while I be happy with this purchase , I would consider spend extra money for the crinkle nylon version -- the Micro Fiber be sturdy , but not as plush as the nylon .
Bag	NEG	1	so far as I can tell , there be no problem with the camera case , but it be too big for the PowerShot s100 , and not big enough to hold the camera and charger . I be return one I recieve as a gift -- this could be the perfect case for another camera .
Bag	POS	4	I buy this case as a accessory to my HP 315 PhotoSmart digital camera . I like the camera very much so it may be bias my view of the bag , but here go :  I like the bag . it be attractive to look at . it be a bit big for the camera I buy , but too big be better than too small !  it be get one main pouch that be very large and I use it to hold my camera and all my cord .  it have a shoulder strap that I do not like -lrb- because it make I look like a tourist -rrb- .  overall it be a very good bag , if a little large with a ugly shoulder strap .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be top-notch in it be construction and feature ... truly functional with space for everything I carry during the day . my only dislike be that the padded section -lrb- for a laptop computer -rrb- be only pad on 3 side , leave one entire side of the computer unprotect . a relatively small problem in a otherwise great bag .
Bag	POS	5	I have burn my way through several beltsander , and actually this be the second Makita belt sander I have own . this sander be a workhorse ... you can use it all day , and it be still ready for more ! it be one of the quietest sander I have own -lrb- although none of they can truely be call `` qiuet '' -rrb- . but , my favorite feature of this sander be its ability to lay flat when it be turn upside down -lrb- this way it can be use as a temporary stationary sander -rrb- .
Bag	NEU	3	it be realy a nice bag however it to small for every thing to fit in if you have load of accesory to fit in
Bag	NEU	3	I have own a number of bucketboss product and I generally like they . this item be just on the ok side . it be make of the same material as other Gatemouth bag so it be pretty tough , but it be functionality be low for I . it do not have enough pocket and the one it have be not all that big . even the main compartment seem small , I can not fit my drill in there , much less charger and battery . this bag do not come with a strap or even hook to fit a strap on it . grant , I should have study the picture closer which do not show any of these . this be not the bag for carry around too long . if you need a bag to put small tool in for home repair , this be the one for you . for anything else , upgrade .
Bag	POS	4	I order this without think much about how much help it would be . I have only use it a few time , but already I can see that I 'll do as the other contractor\/reviewer say and buy several for different type of job . this first one be hold assorted screw , bit , bit holder , tape measure , etc. so that when I be start work , I do not have to search through box and bottle for the thing I 'll need ... I just grab the bag and go . I carry it by the outer string rather than the loop handle in the middle and this pull the top tight so nothing be likely to spill unless I drop it . I like it ! good purchase .
Bag	NEG	2	please pay attention to the one to three star rating . this dust collection bag only capture 50 % or less of the dust come off the Bosch table see . it be not really worth the money . the table see just do not build up enough air pressure to force much of the dust into the bag . a much better , although more expensive , solution be a shop vacuum connect to  the dust Deputy   the dust Deputy  great combination and a much cleaner work shop .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this bag specifically to enter my first pro game stadium at Qwest Field in Seattle because of they bag size restriction . it hold everything and more . it hold my Sony alpha 300 with stock lens , telephoto lens , Sony Cybershot , waterproof case for Cybershot , wide angle , extra battery , filter , memory card and my hd camcorder which I leave at the hotel since the stadium do not allow video recording . oh yeah and a microfiber hand towel . I also take it out in Portland during a steady drizzle of rain and my equipment be not even touch . I think the bag do come with a rain cover but it do not - no biggie as I do not intend to carry it out in the rain anyways . it do get a tad heavy if you load it up and I wish it be juuust a bit contoured so when you have it on you hip it do not sit so awkwardly but overall it be a great bag if you intention be to carry all you gear .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for the back of my suv . I have two 50-foot extension cord and a 25-foot bounce around in a box , and when I see this I could not resist . pro : Quality : the fabric and the stitch look awesome . con : size ... if anything it be on the small side , which could be good , because it could easily fit under the driver 's seat in a truck or van . but I do not even try put the second 50-ft cord in after I have the first one and the 25-foot cord in there and snug -lrb- both be 14 awg -rrb- . I would buy it again , and I would rather buy two than a large bulky one -lrb- multiple cord get heavy fast -rrb- . thus I think it deserve five star , even though it be smaller than what I be originally look for .
Bag	NEU	3	this bag be a good size for my Panasonic Palmcorder . hold the camera , a few tape , the instruction booklet , and a spare battery . just not enough room to really fit the charger . overall , though , it meet my expectation and I feel it be worth it .
Bag	POS	5	I be very pleased with this product . it be as advertise . well make , well think out , sturdy and good color for a man . Bucket Boss have do a good job of see a need and fill it . this make a excellent gift .
Bag	POS	5	for the price , this product be great . it collect 80-90 % of the sawdust and be easy to empty . what more could you ask for ?
Bag	NEG	2	this bag appear to be very durable and have ample space for storage . the problem be access the storage area at the bottom of the bag . in order to get to the storage area in the bottom of the bag you have to remove everything from the top . we return the bag for this reason . this bag would have be perfect if there be a zipper access along the base that open up the bottom storage area for easy access .
Bag	POS	4	this tote make lug around a etx90 spot scope much easier . there be one internal compartment and a zippered internal pocket . there be enough room for the etx90 and a few accessory . just don ' r forget to bring you tripod ...
Bag	NEG	2	this bag have enough space for still , video camera , a small compact tripod , power charge cord and all other cord , minus dv . however the outer look and quality of the bag be same as any other bag which you can buy under $ 10 . Bieng samsonite brand I have expect to have outstanding look and outer finish . however it be just a ordinary quality bag which you can pick up in wall mart for lot less price .
Bag	POS	5	that be right folk , this bag be in fact better than those make by Canon . I recently purchase a Canon a20 digicam as a backup for my Canon S100 Elph . both be excellent cam . I buy the Canon PSC100 bag for the Elph , and though it fit like a glove , and retain the slick elph form , it have no protection , little storage space , or extra . if you drop the bag , even on the carpet , you be do for . and do I mention there be no special cloth material to protect the lcd screen ?  now for the LowePro bag . this baby 's awesome ! it have enough compartment to store 8 extra aa battery & 1 extra cf card , or 4 extra aa battery & 3 extra cf card . plus , the material hug the digicam 's very plush , create a warm and protective feeling . and there be also something special in the back . you can actually pull out a nylon hood to cover the bag on a rainy day . they think of everything . excellent work LowePro .  highly recommend for any digicam ... just find one that fit you cam 's dimension .
Bag	POS	5	I have only use it a couple of time to remove material from door bottom so as to clear new carpeting . work great ! light weight , easy to handle with good feel . do not gouge . dust catcher be good - not great . I would definitely recommend base on my limited use to date .
Bag	POS	5	this product be of very impressive quality and the price be certainly right . its designer obviously put a lot of time and think into the final product . I have no idea that I could put it to so many productive use . this be a winner !
Bag	POS	4	this be my first belt sander and I buy it because I need to refinish some walnut paneling . it make strip old finish a breeze ! I have even use it to edge plane some rough cut cherry face frame stock with good success -lrb- use a Klingspor planer belt -rrb- . change belt be easy , and the auto-tracking mechanism work well . I also find the speed control to be really useful . like other I find the dust port to be on the wrong side of the tool , and it have be difficult try to find a adapter to my vaccum that work well .
Bag	POS	4	I have a digital camera that have a large zoom lens . this bag accomodate it and other accessory , memory and gadget quite well . the outboard zipper pocket allow for other personal effect to be stow away and safe . Perfect for travel or a photo shoot . not to big or small . the leather like surface can receive rough handling without fall apart . at approx -lrb- price -rrb- it be be very good deal .
Bag	POS	5	the interior of Lowepro D-Res 10 AW be make of soft fabric that form a thick cushion to protect digital camera . the exterior be strong and durable . the hidden jacket at the bottom of the bag could be pull out to cover the bag for water-proof purpose . its easy attachment to the belt do not require take off of the belt in order to mount the bag on the waist . as of the size , it fit a Canon s20 perfectly with a side slot that hold up to 2 li-ion battery and a front pocket that hold one cf card . bottom line : I feel safe to put my digital camera in this bag .
Bag	POS	5	I like this belt sander because it have good power output , and be very trim for sand item in place . also it be build to sand very close to the nose as you can remove the front grip . this sander be also easy to hold onto in awkward position , and be very streamlined . I have own more than one of this same model , and I would buy another for theese same reason . I have also find they to be very durable .
Bag	NEU	3	this product , I think , be fairly ok . it only have room for 1 roll of film and it doesnt have a lot of padding if it fall . but the perk be it have a cool sleek design to it but it be what be on the inside that count .
Bag	POS	5	I really like this bag but be very worried about how my camera would fit -lrb- Canon s110 -rrb- in the bag . I be do a lot of comparison shopping on-line and even use the Lowepro Matrix -lrb- a list of all Lowepro bag and which camera fit best in they -rrb- and they recommend the d-res 10 aw . I find that place my camera in vertically give it too much space to jostle around . place it in the other way give a snugger fit , but now there be a gap between the top of the camera and the bag . the `` gap '' will accommodate 2 cf card with case and the pouch , a battery , give that configuration .  those with compact camera such as mine should consider look at the d-re 8 model . it be more compact , cheaper , although it do not have the all weatherproof cover to pull over the case like the d-re 10 .  i also recommend store the desiccant in the case to avoid moisture ruin you camera . you can just pop they in the oven when they have absorb too much moisture to redry they so that they can be reuse .  overall , I think the bag be a fine product . just make sure you visit a store to find the best fit with you equipment and accessory .
Bag	NEU	3	this work ok , but I have not test it against hook up my shop vac since I can ' t find a adapter for my ridgid vac . I wish they have design the bag 4 inch shorter . when I fold up the gravity stand , the bag hang down and get catch up in the wheel . more than once , I fold the bag over the rod to roll the stand around , forget to unfold it and then use the saw . the bottom port fill up quickly and then really throw the dust back up through the blade area .
Bag	POS	4	do not plan to keep battery or lens along with you camera in this bag . so tight , sometimes camera switch turn on when you insert camera in bag . Adequate if no accessory . weather protection cover a big plus in the rain .
Bag	POS	5	I have give this sander limited use so far , but it have perform flawlessly . Belt track nicely without need adjustment , and the sander be light and easy to control . it work very nicely for the first project -lrb- shape the edge of a culture marble shower wall -rrb- .
Bag	NEG	1	this bagger be worthless uless you want a lot of dust and debree in you workshop -lrb- and lung -rrb- -- it collect almost nothing . hook a ShopVac to the exhaust of you table saw .
Bag	NEG	1	it be so unbalanced ... it will turn on its head whenever a cam-body be inside ... . I use with a k7 , and crack it because of the really bad balance of this package ... warning : do not buy it !
Bag	POS	5	great bag for the money . seem to be robust construction and lot of little pocket . the internal divider be simple , adjustable and sturdy . the velcro-closure pocket be only on one side of the bag . the other side be just simple , open-top pocket .
Bag	POS	5	cable fit easily in bag , very tough material , even put a few tool in the bag , screw driver , wrench , channel lock and such .
Bag	POS	5	this be a excellent tool that fit comfortably in you hand . it remove material efficiently and be easy to control . the belt tracking system work better than any other I have use . since it be light weight -lrb- for a belt sander -rrb- , it will not wear you out like most other unit . the inline design allow you to easily get into tight space and unlike many sander , the dust collection system really work . it be make in Switzerland and the result quality be obvious .
Bag	POS	4	Perfect size for a slr and one or two lens or a lens and flash . my favorite feature be the pull out cf card holder . I have use this bag for over a year with no complaint .
Bag	POS	5	this camera bag be exactly what I be look for . it have plenty of room for the camera and lens as well as plenty of storage space .
Bag	POS	5	here be the deal , this be a table saw . it make sawdust . the hole on the back by the power cord be a sawdust exhaust port . if you have a dust collector , by all means plug a vacuum hose into that port and it may even collect all the dust . I do not have a dust collector , this mean the exhaust port throw sawdust a good 7 foot or so out the back of the saw . add this collector bag now mean I only have to sweep up directly under the saw , not under the saw and a arc 7 foot out away from the saw . to I it be absolutely worth it , but it will not replace a several hundred or thousand dollar dust collection system .
Bag	POS	5	if you be a person who like to have the basics in you car , this be a great product . I always have jumper cable -lrb- some of you call they `` booster cable '' -rrb- in every car I own . I have drag old cable from one car to the next as I have buy and sell car over the year . this bag keep the cable orderly and protected , as well as protect you car 's interior from the end clamp and dirt on the cable . it be easy to grab and find you cable when need , and the bag be big enough to throw-in a flashlight as well . you know you need a flashlight because it seem jumper cable be most need at night . I have 3 car , and one of they just go to my newly-licensed son . it be not the greatest gift he ever recieve , but he sure appreciate have a bag of cable in he trunk rather than cable just float around in there .
Bag	POS	5	this be a great quality bag if you can get it for under ten dollar . nice , light-weight , utility bag .
Bag	POS	5	my dog be 10 , so I have have the opportunity to try lot of different bag . there be the best . they look good -lrb- in that you can not see anything when fill ! -rrb- , they be easy to open , and I love the extra lining at the bottom . I also really appreciate that they be biodegradable . one large box last I about 5 month . I have never have a problem with they be weak or degrading before they time .
Bag	POS	5	I receive my Bucket Boss Bag about a month ago and be use it to keep my drill all in one place along with the bit and charger . it work very well and and I well pleased with this bag .
Bag	POS	5	it be always a pleasure to use a well design product . the 1274dv be such a product . the belt change be a snap ; pull the lever back , install the belt , push the lever back . Belt tracking adjustment be easy and stay put . the front grip come off and allow sand in tight place . I have develop `` tennis elbow '' and this sander 's light weight help : 7lb vs. pc 's highly rate weight of 13 . when you use a sander vertically or overhead , that make a big difference . the speed control be simple to adjust , and be variable by the amount of tension place on the trigger . even if you have it set to max speed , by not pull the trigger all the way , the speed will be less than max . the sander be make in Switzerland , and this have to be better than China . this sander feel great out of the box , sand flat and I highly recommend it .
Bag	NEU	3	I return the bag because it be too small for my camera and accessory . I purchase a larger bag from you .
Bag	POS	5	Quality 's a + , get it cheaper than advertise elsewhere and the most convenient ever to carry my camcorder , regular and digital camera + battery , film and binoculars .
Bag	POS	5	I love this case .  I own three Lowepro case ; a `` Topload Zoom 2 '' -lrb- which I use whenever I take any of my slr camera in the field -rrb- , a `` d-res 8 '' for my Canon s400 , and and a `` d-res 10 aw '' , which I use with my Fuji mx-1700 digital camera . I think that all of they be exceptionally good . they be well-made , durable , good look and functional . before settle on Lowepro a couple of year ago , I go through dozen of bag , and be never really happy with any of they .  the D-Res 10 aw be the perfect size for my Fuji mx-1700 . it be over two year old now , and look as good as the day that it arrive at my door via UPS - despite the fact that it have see lot of abuse over the last few year .
Bag	NEU	3	just a note : if you buy Nikon 900 series Digital Camera , do not buy this carry case . it be too samll . you will end up send it back . but overall , this be a nice carry case . it look and feel like leather . it include 2 accessory panel to hold spare battery and memory card .
Bag	POS	5	give this as a bday gift for my bf and he love it ... in it he put 2 large slr body and 3 lens , flash , extra charger and battery and card of course ... and it be hold up just fine ... it be sturdy but I would not overload it though ... the texture be very thick and the strap be reliable and comfortable ... I would suggest this for someone who be look for a nice , sturdy , less expensive multiple camera bag ... would not doubt it ...
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this bag on Amazon to be use at my job about two month ago . I work as a delivery Guy for a appliance store , and I also assemble thing at the store when not on the Truck . I keep everything I need in this bag , and then some ! Nut Drivers , Screw Drivers , wrench -lrb- pipe , crescent , open\/box set -rrb- , tape measure , a small level , Pliers of all sort , a rubber mallet and a hammer , and I even throw in a 12v black and Decker drill along with bit and a set of power nut driver . the scary thing be ... it CAN hold more ! bad for my tool buy addiction , but good for the on the go handy man who need everything ! very sturdy ! can not recommend enough . also have a guy work with I who have the Gatemouth Jr. , andit be another great bag , albeit a little smaller .
Bag	NEG	2	I just receive the belt sander . there be a slight oil stain in the bottom of the box , fine saw dust on the body , and metal scratch mark on the metal base on the bottom of the sander . hard to say , but some packaging might have be miss as well . use . I do not understand how this can happen but if I have to guess I would put this on Makita rather than Amazon who do not sell use version of this product . anyway , I just get off the phone and will be send it back . inspect yours carefully when you get it . note on Amazon return . I fill out a inquiry then have Amazon call I for help which they do immediately . after that I explain the problem and within minute I they issue I a return slip and will be pay for the shipping . also , they be rush I a new sander by tomorrow . while I be disappointed something like this could happen , and I be not happy about the time I waste , kudos to Amazon for make the return policy so quick and hassle free . this review have nothing to do with the performance of the belt sander as I do not even plug it in before send it back .
Bag	POS	5	i be expect shipping to be much longer ; so i be bowl over at the tracking that say my makita 9903 beltsander be on it be way . i just spend a great afternoon put my new best tool through it be pace . i be a woman ... one accustom to hard work ... and even i be a little wary of the weight of this superb worker . after a few hour of tryout , i barely notice the weight ... it be well balanced and that account for the ease of use . at that , i never once let it go full weight on the dig fur i be trim down , and i do not get tired . the belt trim and bevel beautifully . i do not have a table saw and do not want one . i rip cut my lumber with a steady hand on my circular saw . however i need some wood center brace for under my new shed set on concrete . hard to get they as snug as this virgo want without a powerful belt sander to take off no more than about 1\/32 off the top . makita do just that uniformly and in a snap . darned nice dust collector . that puppy be jam . really do it be job . i do a ton of research before buy at the best price anywhere -lrb- and fast free shipping as well ! -rrb- i want to have one that can be use in a vice . when i pull this one out of the box i realize i will have to wait to make a wood frame myself for it ; my vice , big as it be not wide enough . also , i have to puzzle over just where to afix the vice side ... it will lay flat upside down , but grip the side may take some thinking . gouge be very possible with this puppy go full throttle , but just take a afternoon and some wood scrap and get use to the feel of this totally great little worker and you should have no trouble . when i gouge a bit i just do a descend light circular setdown and it clear right up . i start on a table tomorrow and be eager to use this hard worker . oh , and i notice the roller at the front be good-sized and i plan to use it to finish some large curve for a big treli i plan to build next month . this be gonna be one very use piece of equipment , for sure !
Bag	POS	4	I be look for a dslr camera bag to keep my new Pentax k110d in until I find a more expansive bag\/backpack . I would eventually like a Tamron or something along that line but for the price , I want to be able to browse until I find just the right one . this product suit the basic bag need well . it be not huge or fancy , just a good basic bag . it have one front pocket that will hold battery , memory card , etc. and one pocket in the `` lid '' that hold a lens cloth or other small item . it accommodate the stock lens that come on my camera but I do not think would fit a much longer lense . for the price , -lrb- which be very reasonable -rrb- I would buy this bag again .
Bag	NEG	1	would get the same result if I tie on a old sock to the dust chute . quickly clog and become ineffective . use a vac or dust collector instead .
Bag	POS	5	a fantastic camera at a unbelievable price . I have take picture throughtout Europe , Australia and New zealand in all kind of weather and light condition with always the same excellent result . a great camera to take take on a hurry up and keep move tour . it take wonderful landscape , animal and people picture . even do well from a move boat or car . the auto focus be incredible . just point and shoot , the camera will lock on focus . we be now off to South America .
Bag	POS	5	Got this for my jvc-grdvm90u ... work great ... get the camcorder and all accessory include charger , cable , extra tape and manual to fit comfortably ... very stylish ... nice handle which make it very easy to carry ... highly recommend it ...
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for my boyfriend for Christmas . it be just what he want . it be roomy and material be sturdy . I would recommend it for anyone need a bag for all they metal detect equipment . thanks .
Bag	POS	5	Belt sander may be one of those power tool that be not pull out often , but when you need to remove large quantity of stock , you will want to have one . the 9403 , 4x24 sander be powerful , have good balance , good belt tracking and easy belt change . this Makita also pick up a very decent amount of sand dust , have comfortable handle , a nice soft-start , and , most importantly , chew through stock with ease . this belt sander be possibly the best 4x24 on the market . I be very , very pleased with it . it be a genuine pleasure to operate this Makita , compare to my old craftsman 3x21 which I have receive as a gift year ago . I spend as much time adjust the belt tracking on the Craftsman as I do sand , but since I use it infrequently , I just put up with the excessive noise and generally less than stellar performance . after use the 9403 for 2 + year , I shake my head everytime I use it , wonder why I wait so long to replace my old one . I find myself pull this sander out and use it more often . long cord be always a big plus for I , often eliminate the need for extension cord in the shop . I just can not find anything negative to say about this machine yet . note : be advertise as ` quiet ' at 84db be pretty relative since -rrb- 90db for sustained period will deafen ... hearing loss be cummulative over time around high db power tool -lrb- router , table and miter saw , plate joiner , etc. -rrb- even if rate under the 90db threshold ... wear ear protection -lrb- check out Peltor H10A Professional Earmuff Hearing Protectors -rrb- .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for my camcorder awhile back and it be a pretty decent bag . it be sturdy and it hold everything I need . it be decent bag if you travel light however if you be look for a bag that fit all you camcorder equipment -lrb- if you intend use for the bag be a carry case -rrb- then you be better off get something else .
Bag	NEG	2	I take a lot of photography trip on weekend . one thing I like to do be to leave my 70-200mm or 100-400mm lens attach to the camera , on top of the photo bag in the passenger seat of the truck while I drive in rural area . if I see something of interest , I stop the truck grab the camera , get out and take some image . that be what attract I to this product . the issue with this bag be that if you have a lens with a lens hood , the lens will not fit in the compartment of the bag , and still be functional as be advertise -lrb- and as I describe above -rrb- . I have a 24-70 with lens hood , a 16-35 with lens hood , a 70-200 with lens hood , a 100-400 with lens hood , a 100mm macro with lens hood , etc. . these lens do not fit in the bag , with the hood invert , if you want to carry you camera across the top as picture . I try to make it work , and end up return the bag .
Bag	POS	4	this bag be a good value . it do not leave much extra space inside , depend on the length of the cord you have , but it get the job do .
Bag	POS	4	this case be the perfect size for the d-460 and accessory -lrb- case be approx 7 '' tall x 3.5 '' wide x 3 '' deep -rrb- . the main pouch be well padded and make of soft material . the bottom be reinforce to resist wear . inside the front zippered pocket , there be a mesh pocket for memory card , as well as a divide elastic band mean for 4 aa battery . inside the flap of the front pocket there be a zippered mesh pouch , which run the entire legnth of the flap -lrb- approx . 6 `` x3 '' -rrb- , for extra accessory .  the only thing I dislike be the velcro on the main flap be a bit weak , and seem to come open without much force . I would have rather see a zipper to keep the main pouch close .  other than that , this be a fantastic case , and I recommend it .
Bag	NEG	1	like tit on a bull . I be work with a dado blade , and maybe 5 % of any chips\/dust make it into the bag - the rest fall to the floor . if anybody have a better solution , please let I know .
Bag	POS	5	wow , I can not believe it be be 7.5 year that I have owned\/used this bag ! I buy two of they in November 2000 - one for I , one for my mom . we both use they extensively . I keep wish Amazon would bring it back ! this tote hold EVERYTHING . I have not use it much as a laptop tote , but it work well for that . otherwise , the laptop pocket be great for transport papers and magazine since that compartment be separate . the outside pocket be roomy without thing get too lose into it , and there be extra hang pocket inside the main compartment as well as a removable keychain clip . the bag itself be lightweight but very durable . it be awesome as a airplane carryon . this be a fabulous value at $ 5.95 when I buy it - worth well over that price .
Bag	POS	5	what a great buy ! this bag work great for either a digital still camera or mini camcorder . I purchase the Lowepro 40aw after research they on the internet and check out the lowepro site . I originally buy the 40 aw to use with my Toshiba PDR M-5 Digital still Camera . I could fit either the still camera and all the accessory -- cable , filter , you name it , or my Canon zr10 with \* almost \* all the gear . but I love it so much I buy the Lowepro Digital beltpack AW for the zr10 . they be high quality camera bag and the Digital variety come with a special lining that will not scratch sensitive lcd screen ! lot of extra little pocket for tape , smart card , cable , and charger too . the outside be soft yet rugged and well construct . I think my high dollar digital camera investment feel safe and sound in this great camera bag !
Bag	POS	5	Unreal , get here quick in good condition and be just what I want . thank you
