Gloves	NEU	3	I be in construction and need to wear glove . these glove fit and be comfortable while work , and I use they more often than regular leather glove . the drawback , though , be that while the tip last longer than regular glove the side of the finger tear apart after only 2 month . I think that for the price , I be better off buy leather glove .
Gloves	POS	5	these welding glove do what they be suppose to . I just start use they so I can not speak to long-term durability but they feel as strong as any other leather welding glove I have use . when put they on for the first time , they be very comfortable and fit pretty well . I normally wear size l glove . I hope this help because I be use they for welding and not for a costume . I guess I can not blame they though , if I be shop for something , I would want what I see in the picture . in my case , my glove be the same color as what be picture ; maybe just a tad darker .
Gloves	NEG	1	I have have several pair of ironclad glove that be quite satisfactory ; however , the last pair purchase start come apart immediately . the closure at the wrist -lrb- on one glove -rrb- fall off the first time I wear they . all of the stitching be unraveling . sadly , it appear they quality have decline significantly .
Gloves	NEG	1	these be extremely uncomfortable workout glove . I use a few time then purchase another brand . would strongly recommend against purchase these .
Gloves	POS	4	fit well , be comfortable . the big plus and minus be that these do not have the velcro wrist closure like the original . . this mean they be easier and more convenient -lrb- and hence more likely to be use -rrb- . . the minus be the minor possibility of debris enter at the wrist . . buy these . .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be comfortable and the price be right ! I have not use they for any heavy duty work - mostly just lug around dirty car part - so I can not really comment on how well they hold up to abuse . they clean up nicely after I get they full of grease and gunk . Might just pick up another pair to keep around the house
Gloves	NEG	1	these glove be comfortable to wear , however the leather separate and disintegrate on the middle finger on the SECOND use . these be not heavy duty glove as advertise . not even light duty glove . very disappoint .
Gloves	POS	5	I wear these glove for work , where I be constantly digging with a shovel , pick , or bar and they be outstanding . they endure as long as any good pair of work glove should . I also use they to operate heavy equipment which require dexterity from a glove and they perform well there as well . more interestingly however be that I wear they skydive . while skydive it be necessary to use a glove that allow you to feel so that you can find you hacky use to deploy you main parachute ... and if necessary so that you may feel you emergency handle . it be also desire to have somewhat of a sticky texture for the very same reason , as well as to maintain a good grip on other skydiver when do `` relative work '' . despite the fact that these be `` fast fit '' they do not come off in the air , though they do allow I to remove they quickly if necessary . I have recently be jump in cold weather as well . I add silk liner when jump in cold weather but they be the only glove I can use with the liner and still maintain very good dexterity and feel , and be plenty warm when combine with the liner .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be the bee ' knee . they fit snugly without be overtight and have just the right amount of cushioning . I normally have my glove last year , so will have to see how long these last . I have get no reason to think they will not though . I be thoroughly pleased I buy they .
Gloves	POS	5	the ironclad general utility provide warmth , comfort , a excellent grip , versatility , and to top it off , they look great . what more could you ask for ?
Gloves	POS	5	these glove work great and be perfect and at the best price for vinyl powder free glove . they dont tear or leak perfect fit . totally recommend these glove for the application of color and relaxer .
Gloves	NEG	1	I get these when I start and I have buy much better glove since . pro - cheap - breathable palm con - hand compartment be very loose . this be dangerous ! - knuckle padding be insufficient - padding be at a weird angle so there be a gap between the glove and you hand . - wrist support be terrible ; handwrap can not make up for this completely . - fake leather be very thin especially on the palm side - stitching be fall apart if you plan to use these for more than aerobic , you will hurt you hand and wrist . if you get serious at all , you will probably upgrade within a month or two . just save you $ 25 towards better glove now .
Gloves	POS	5	I get these to do my `` pick '' in local garage sale and auction . I have long finger and they fit really well , I like leather better , but these really fit and I hope they last a while .
Gloves	POS	5	I order the G & f glove for my husband . they be leather and really sturdy , yet comfortable . additionally , they fit he hand ; many other glove do not . my husband and I recommend they .
Gloves	POS	5	I live the the hot and humid southeast US and get these as a outdoor wood glove for which they seem to work nice . hopefully they will hold up over time . I be glad that I choose the XL over the large since they come a little tighter than expect but I be confident they will stretch with use . overall a nice glove with good hand protection that I feel will handle anything I throw at they .
Gloves	POS	5	have have ALTUS Leather glove for a looong time , which do a pretty good job , these be quite a few grade higher in term of overall quality , comfort , functionality and convenience . sure my old ALTUS Gloves be washable however they really be not create with that in mind at all I imagine , give they be entirely leather and get very sweaty-dirty quite quickly . these harbinger breathe quite nicely indeed , fit very comfortably pre-break in , and have a keen sense of design both in cut and design . they really enhance you concentrative strength instead of less than optimal functionality insofar as try to always adjust to avoid grip\/palm pain for example . these be great for many different use aside weight ... I notice a reviewer mention they be great wheelchair glove , and I can clearly see how easily they can be . also great for drive , alot of outdoor work and also I find they to be great for tactical use and training as well . very nice subtle cushioning in all the right spot . personally I find the pair in black look rather appeal , very intelligent design and perfect stitching . and of course , be machine washable be ideal with no indication of degradation . for I one bit of advice would be buy a size larger for more dextrous use - they will shrink - although break back in just fine for lifting , however for thing that require more finite handling , I find shrink down and break in a larger size certainly make the difference . a couple pair will definitely come in handy for a very good time .
Gloves	POS	5	I have not actually use the glove yet , since I have not reach a high enough weight where I be limit by the pain in my hand , but I do try they on and they feel great . they also come promptly and without a hitch .
Gloves	POS	5	this be my first pair of mechanic glove . I must say , these be by far better than the blue latex glove mechanic usually wear . these actually offer great protection for you hand when work around heavy car gear -lrb- suspension , control arm , etc. -rrb- my only regret be I wish I buy these sooner when I be do more work on the car .
Gloves	POS	5	I do all my own work on my car in some stupid condition . a month ago i change the thermostat on my jeep outside when it be 30 degree outside . grant that be not subzero , but these glove surprising keep my hand decently warm and still able to tight screw by hand and do some pretty nimble task . from other review I read I be surprise by how warm they keep my hand and how much tactile feel they do remove . do not get I wrong these be not a winter work glove and these do keep much more tactile feel than other glove , but read other review you would think they be a second skin . I would really recommend the ` fast fit ' style as well because I always have task I need to take they on and off for work on car . all in all these be excellent glove and well worth the ten dollar I pay for they . they seem pretty durable as well . but we shall see !
Gloves	POS	5	I have be use these glove for several year now . they fit very nice and snug and last forever . tip - flip they inside out after each workout to let the inside of the glove dry out . if not , after some time , it start to smell . that go for all glove ... not only this one .
Gloves	POS	5	I be use a cheap pair of workout glove for about a year or so , and end up get callous on my upper palm , and sometimes after a heavy workout session I would feel my hand be sore from the bar . I wear these glove and the padding be so comfortable you do not feel any uncomfort on you finger or palm . definitely worth purchasing .
Gloves	POS	5	have use these glove for a while , on my 3rd pair , and they be great . slip they on and off with no problem , they fit my hand perfectly there be no bunching or loose fingertip which make I want to wear they for just about anything . the exterior do get cut up and nick pretty easily but I would rather the glove get tear up than my hand . I use they for pull up carpet , tack strip , work on the car , some yard work , hammering , put up wall stud , drywall , plywood , store holiday decoration and any other possible use I can come up with .
Gloves	POS	5	this be my third pair of ironclad glove . I use the other two very hard and be amaze at the durability . they feel like no other glove out there . I be so impressed with the glove that I be go to buy a lot for Christmas present . good job Ironclad . finally a good glove that I can wear all day .
Gloves	NEG	2	these may be decent glove for beginner but if you be a decent amateur fighter , train semus seriously , or throw heavy punch on the bag , pick another glove . I use these glove for about 3 week and the middle knuckle on my left hand be start to hurt from throw a lot of jab . I think I be just go to have to bite the bullet and buy a more expensive more serious hook and loop glove as these just dont do the job .
Gloves	POS	4	well padded , even too padded . its alot more padded than I expect , and actually , make the glove much bigger than I expect . if I have to do it again , I would probably buy the smaller cheaper , Harbinger glove . if I be want a bigger glove with lot of padding , this product would have be perfect .
Gloves	NEG	2	these dainty and delicate glove be a must have for anyone 's Halloween wardrobe . but I do not recommend they for actual metal work . as crazy as it sound , I use they for welding - hobby level at that - and the lining in mine rip free when put my hand in on the second day . the feel lining go up to the wrist , where it be sew to the leather shell , albeit poorly .
Gloves	POS	5	I work with alot of cardbord and it drye out my hand , and be realy rough on my hand , the glove have good grip and prevent my hand from be cut up .
Gloves	POS	4	good quality , tough glove . I order medium since my winter glove and the latex glove I use at work be also medium size . however , the glove run small . they be very snug , and although after several use they seem to be loosen up a bit , I still find myself struggle to `` peel '' they off of my hand from how tight they fit . highly suggest go one size bigger if purchasing .
Gloves	NEG	2	glove serve purpose . I use they surf -lrb- occasionally -rrb- & you do notice much more power in each stroke . they do fill with water which make the a little cumbersome & heavy increase fatigue . I would not recommend these for swim training -lrb- pool -rrb- , I have use plastic hand paddle & they work far better , but , as say these provide grip when out on the surf board & keep you hand slightly warmer .
Gloves	POS	5	I find some of these locally and I love they . they be well make , comfortable , and look cool . it be party make out of breathable material which I do not appreciate until a really heavy work out .
Gloves	POS	4	I buy these glove to wear during maintenance on my car . they be very comfortable and seem quite durable for the purpose I need they for . they breathe well and provide great grip when handle tool and other hardware . I do not want to spend a bunch of money for glove that be go to get greasy and dirty , so these fit the bill perfectly . the only reason they do not get 5 star be because it be hard to pick up tiny screw and bolt with my finger tip when wear the glove .
Gloves	POS	4	these weightlifting glove be exactly what I have hope they would be . they fit well and provide the appropriate amount of padding .
Gloves	POS	4	pro : well make . Easy to put on and take off . good resistance in the water . comfortable . con : color do not hold up to the chlorine in the pool . the color will fade in a short time .
Gloves	POS	5	I be go to buy the velcro version of these but think I would try the fast fit glove as they be cheaper . im glad I do they fit really snug and stay on really well . they be well worth the price and I think be a better deal than the velcro one . make out of good material and really stand up to some rough work . they also allow you to work with smaller object unlike some work glove .
Gloves	POS	5	I love work out without any glove and I do not mind have callus on my hand . however , I purchase this glove for health\/sanitary reason . I hear that the weight be actually one of the dirtiest item . as a matter of fact , you can get some skin disease from it . when the package arrive , I inspect the glove . the glove be well make and it seem sturdy enough to last for long time . I believe this be a worth while purchase and hopefully it can last a long time . until I have a personal gym at home , this glove seem like it will do the job .
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these before go into a summer job at a golf course and want something where I could handle small thing but would be strong and protected . the extra padding on the fingertip be very good and useful . the glove be a great fit and they breathe well too . after look over a lot of different glove before buy I make a great decision with these and would definitely buy they again .
Gloves	POS	5	I have be wear swim glove for several year and I have be very pleased with the quality of these . these glove be the only brand I have worn-much more comfortable than wear the paddle on the hand . the velcro stay secure and strong . I swim lap twice\/week and go through a pair of these about every 2 year . the neoprene right past the wrist area will show `` wear '' with all the put on and take off over time , of course . I recommend this brand .
Gloves	POS	5	these be purchase for a friend that work at a grocery store deli . they be use for cold and room temp box that have be on pallet or in the freezer . be use 6 day a week from 6-8 + hour they have last a while . they even save my friend from a nasty cut thumb ! the grip do help , but like anything that be be use a lot , it wear . overall a good buy .

Gloves	NEG	2	this glove be just ok ... I like the leather palm , but it just do not fit as well as other glove that I have try . you can feel the seam in the fingertip and the glove leave blister on my hand , and blister be cause by movement . Make sure you get a good fitting glove . the Mechanix wear 4.0 glove be similar to this glove but with a better fit , any of those glove be better than this pair .

Snug fit , secure fastening , and fantastic price . would recommend to anyone currently try to get back into training
Gloves	POS	5	I drive a tow truck -lrb- Mindy 's husband here -rrb- , and these be a little light for I . I wear through the thumb and first finger in about 5 week of full time use . they be still great glove . I will be get another pair , and save the heavy stuff for bulky leather glove .
Gloves	NEG	1	I buy these to use with my heavy bag . I have average size hand and these fit almost perfect , maybe slightly loose , without wrap on . but you need to wear wrap , and these would not fit with wrap on . also , the chemical smell on this be pretty strong and it make I feel nauseated . I be not sure what to do , because I do not want to spend a lot of money for glove . but these be useless .
Gloves	POS	5	one of the best glove , for a certain type off weight lifting . I use it for my chest exercise , it give very good padding , but if you a look something that will give you a good grip , get something else .
Gloves	NEG	1	the fit of these glove be terrible . I measure like the instruction say and even order a size larger .

I use they for food preparation -lrb- raw meat , dice chili pepper , etc -rrb- and they have be excellent . many similar glove I have get in the past will have several glove that tear or break when I put they on , but none so far for I ! the only thing be the glove be a little large ; I order XL and wear XL for most other glove-related thing , and these glove be somewhat -lrb- barely -rrb- loose . I kind have expect glove to be a little more snug , so I guess I 'll buy l next time around .
Gloves	POS	4	these fit small compare to my other harbinger glove . my other set be a medium , so I figure a medium would fit . it do not . should have order a large . the skin between my finger always get pinch . I still tolerate it though . these glove have padding in all the right place for every exercise , pushup , bar , free weight ... after a few month of use these glove , they still do not smell which be AWESOME . I could not handle the smell of my old glove and I could not get rid of the smell . they be not the wash & dry like these either which be why I retire they , even though they be still physically in good condition . these do not show much wear\/fatigue indictive of failure . very well craft and build to last like my old harbinger glove . would recommend and buy again .
Gloves	POS	5	I have be lift for over 20 year and I like the feeling of control\/comfort a good pair of glove afford I . as of late however , I develop a cyst on the palm of my left hand which impact my daily routine . I read the review on this glove and most people say it be heavily padded which be something I want . I have use harbinger before and they seem to last although they be not as padded as these be . I be concern about what size to order , so I go with what I use with the previous harbinger I own - large . well , they be well-padded for sure and may be a little uncomfortable for some people but they do the trick for I . I can hardly feel the cyst and I think they actually enhance my workout by provide a much better grip . I have be use they for about 3 week now and they seem to be wear well and provide the support I need . they feel a little stiff at first but as you use they they become more comfortable . the glove seem to be make well , time will tell if they can withstand the abuse .

I can reach into my pocket and GRAB A PEN WITHOUT EMPTYING the contents of pocket on the ground . EVEN HANDLING MONEY be no problem . THESE GLOVES be woth the price of admission .
Gloves	POS	5	IRONCLAD ? what else do you need to SAY ... the ONLY GLOVES MY MEN will wear .
Gloves	POS	5	it be ridiculously difficult to find decent work glove in a size small ! I guess in order to not be emasculate , lot of glove start at a size medium , and as a chick , that be still too big for I . with these , the small not only fit ... like a glove haha , but the quality be way better than what I have be use in a synthetic glove . price be very reasonable for what you be get . in case anyone want to know the content : 50 % synthetic leather 30 % polyester 10 % elastic 5 % foam 3 % polyurethane 2 % polyvinyl chloride , Rubber
Gloves	POS	5	truly great glove use they right away to test they out , flexibility etc. . these be great and if they wear out I 'll be back for more . plus a sweat wipe be on the thumb area of the glove truly awesome

Gloves	POS	4	my guy love these glove , they be warm , tough and let he get the job do . they do not last as long as they use to .
Gloves	POS	5	of course it emphasize the arm and shoulder . I have very large hand -lrb- 6 ' 4 '' -rrb- and base on the review I go with the large . the fit be fine for my hand which be skinny but the finger cut into the web of my hand so I wish I would buy the XL . it be not a problem once I start swim though . my arm get more of a workout but they be not sore and it be not as dramatic a difference as some say . however , anything that make swim more interesting be worth twice the price .
Gloves	POS	5	thank you very much ! I be extremely happy with the fast service of this item . I sincerely and wholeheartedly appreciate it .
Gloves	NEU	3	boy have I have a hard time find a pair of weight lifting glove ! my previous one be simple leather Saranac glove , not much padding but they last for several year . the leather eventually rot out form huge hole . but I can definitely say that the Saranac glove be awesome . now onto the replacement . I try four different type of glove . harbinger 143 Harbinger 1260 Harbinger 1215 Big Grip II GoFit Diamond-Trac The Harbinger 143 glove be ok . they do not have too much padding , but fit very snug and be difficult to get off . also , the finger be short . the Harbinger 1260 and 1215 be both unusable due to have too much padding in the palm and knuckle area . the padding be comfortable for press exercise -lrb- e.g. bench press -rrb- , but make it all but impossible to do pull exercise -lrb- e.g. pull up , curl , deadlift , row , etc. -rrb- . you can try they yourselve , but save some money and take my word for it . the GoFit Diamond-Trac glove be the best of the bunch for my need . they have a little padding in the palm , but not enough to interfere with you grip . they be lightweight , so I be not sure how long they 'll last , but I 'll reserve judgment on that . they do make my hand sweat , because the neoprene on the back do not seem to breathe well . they run a little larger in size than the other glove . also , I like that they have a finger tab to help you pull off the glove . please be kind enough to indicate if review be helpful .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be great for just about everything . they be well make and have great padding for you fist . Ive upload photo of the product which do come with the new yellow `` e '' Everlast logo . these glove be firm so if you do want to do any kind of spar both partner should have proper protective headgear on . if you be look for a great pair of training glove and do not want to spend of $ 30 these be a awesome buy . I order the 16 oz glove which be not to large be small .
Gloves	POS	5	I want to add a little resistance to my lap swimming and water aerobic workout . these glove work really well . I like that my finger be free , and the velcro strap make it easy to adjust .
Gloves	POS	4	so far so good . they come in small size which be good for my smaller hand . I have a question . what be the 2 little tab that be attach near the inner wrist ???
Gloves	NEU	3	I buy a pair of these for work here on the ranch . the first day i split the first layer of leather , but I be rotate the chain on my chainsaw to get a jam out . Probily not design for that . they have some thread that have unravel and a few more cut but I have really run they through the mill . sretch barb wire and drive t post . cut boi d arc post and such be hard on any glove . after a year they be still alive but not real pretty . most of the time I dont wear glove because skin grow back and glove dont but I be start to get tire of bleeding . I would say they be worth buy if you catch a deal on the .
Gloves	POS	5	appear to run on the tight size which maybe a advantage for more intrigate handling . not sure what happen when the glove become wet and then dry .
Gloves	NEU	3	contrary to the product description , these glove be not `` easy-on , easy-off '' . removal always require put down anything you be hold . with other work glove , I can remove one use a armpit and not involve the other hand . for someone like I who take a lot of beer break , open a can become a pain . as other have mention , these glove breathe well . too well for winter work , if you have dry hand like I . but I will probably use these in the summer . I have to admit , they do have a great feel .
Gloves	POS	5	I feel that this be a great product . it be price within my range . the glove fit well and provide good padding for my fist .

Gloves	POS	4	I have use Harbinger glove for some time now and have be happy with they for comfort , fit and durability . I try these because it say washable and be happy with harbinger glove for the most part . the down side to they be the XL size I buy seem to be a large size , so they be a little tight and hard to put on and take off .
Gloves	POS	5	I boughtthese for my boyfriend for valentine 's day in red . they be a little small for he big hand but he do not complain about much discomfort . they come promptly and be package very nicely . I be happy with my purchase !
Gloves	POS	5	I choose these Swim Gloves for resistance training since I want a workout that be less strenuous than one use  swim Paddles  as a beginner , if you swim with the golve finger close -lrb- normal freestlye -rrb- , you get a great lower resistance workout . by gradually open out you finger in the webbed glove , you workout become more strenuous - even approach that of swim paddle ! I love the comfort and natural feel of these Speedo Aqua Fit Swim Gloves . I can even adjust my goggles without have to take off my glove ... something that be impossible to do with paddle on !

Gloves	NEG	1	I buy these glove and they have hole in they in a three day . the stitching come out . they be crap . $ 25 for what ? if you actually work for a living just get a pair of regular leather work glove . these might be fine for weekend warrior but I be a landscaper and these glove just do not cut it . honestly , do not waste you money .
Gloves	POS	5	I have have these glove for at least 4 or 5 year . they have hold up great with medium use . I will use these glove because they be tough and not bulky at all .

I highly recommend they .
Gloves	POS	5	I have purchase these glove in the past and they last I several year . the other thing I enjoy about these glove be the fact that the finger length be longer then normal which help protect my finger .
Gloves	POS	5	this be the second pair of these I buy in a medium . I have read about the problem people have be have with fit . my hand be typically a little smaller than a medium glove and these fit snug , a little tighter than most medium glove I buy . because I think they be suppose to be tight , this be probably about what I expect . I hope that help on size for you . the velcro do not always stay on , but I be not sure of a better way to bind they at the wrist . I be not even sure you need the wrist strap because the glove fit snugly and do not slip . be they the best around ? I do not know , I have the opportunity to try other brands\/styles on at the store and do not like the way they feel , but never use they in a pool . -lrb- I be not `` one of those guy '' , the store either do not have these or they be outrageously price . -rrb- anyhow , I buy they for my daughter think they would be handy for a river-tube trip and try they in the pool . they do not feel like they be do much until you be do swimming . then you arm feel sore , and if you take they off and swim it feel like you hand have shrink ... and you can not get power any more . in other word , what a great work-out ! I buy the second pair for myself I like they so much .
Gloves	NEU	3	can not really rate these as I have to send they back because the size chart they give you to go by be not quite accurate & the glove do not fit . I have give they as a gift & since I have to return they & pay the postage on return they I do not order another pair . it be just not a item that can be order on line . as far as the order , I receive it on time & I have no problem return it .

I be not sure what size to buy -lrb- I be a woman -rrb- and I buy a medium . I even go to the Speedo site to look at the size chart first . either I measure my hand incorrectly , or they run a little big . I think they be Unisex , so I probably should have order a small . it be not a huge deal , but since they cost less on Amazon than they do at most Sporting Good Stores , you may even want to try they on at the store for the correct size .
