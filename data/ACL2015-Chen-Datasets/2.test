RiceCooker	POS	5	if you have four this be the one . it be a great one for just cook when you be busy . it do rice , of course but also really great oatmeal , irish cut . do not hesitate for a small group this be the one !
RiceCooker	POS	4	only have this about a few week , but I use this every 2 day or so . Works great , close tightly so there be no spatter on the counter . Rice start to brown on the bottom but I usually turn it off as soon as the it be do ; if you leave it on `` warm '' for a while it would probably burn .
RiceCooker	POS	5	review be true , this cooker make fine rice . the design and construction be first rate . I think the tactile feedback of the control , carry handle , cooking pot and paddle be a pleasure . the retractable cord and folding handle make storage easy . the maker even give you the choice of attach the paddle holder to the left or right side of the cooker . nice job Zojirushi .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	when it work , this be a nifty device - compact , light , and make good rice . but three time now , I have go to retreive the rice for dinner and discover that the machine switch to `` warm '' long before the rice be cook . that really screw up dinner plan . the whole point of a cooker like this , for I , be that , follow Ron Popiel 's mantra , I can `` set it and forget it '' . with this black and Decker , i can not , render it useless for my purpose . at $ 15 , it be not worth return , but I be annoyed .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have be use this thing basically every day since I receive it -lrb- about 1 month ago -rrb- . it be perfect for serve 1 or 2 people . very reliable and easy to clean . accurate cooking and very convenient automatic shutoff as I often forget to check on what be cooking downstairs . unbeatable price . even if it be to break today I would order another .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have be debate buy a rice cooker for year , but I could never rationalize buy one . I know that ` good ' rice cooker be expensive , it would take up extra kitchen space for a very specialize device , and I be a little worried it would take a lot of trial and error to get it to work properly . my decision change recently when I decide that I need to eat less meat and process food . the most sensible way to do that seem to be to replace some of my diet with simple grain and bean . these food be really cheap , they keep a really long time -lrb- dry -rrb- , they be not heavily process , and they re-heat well . as simple as oatmeal , rice , and bean be to make , the inconvenience be still the primary factor keep I from make they a large part of my diet . when I discover that a rice cooker could be use for all of these food I be sell . I go with this model because it be on the cheaper end of `` fuzzy logic '' cooker , and because it have excellent review . I have be use it for a few month now , and I must say , my initial concern be completely unwarranted . First off , the footprint be very small -lrb- less than 1 by 1.5 ft -rrb- , plus the handle and retractable cord make stow super easy . kitchen space be a very minor issue . this model be also very simple to use ; set timer , set mode , and start . with that , it make spectacular quality white or brown rice every time . since I start use this cooker the amount of grain and rice I eat have go from basically none to over 30 % of my diet . give how much cheaper rice , bean , and oatmeal be when compare to typical food this translate to substantial savings over time . it be also more environmentally conscious to eat that way . I would recommend this cooker to nearly anybody , it be just so simple to use .
RiceCooker	POS	5	order to replace a older , mechanical timer cooker . what a difference , especially for brown and sweet rice that seem to benefit from the computerized timer . also do a great job with egg -lrb- hard boil in the steamer tray , complete with little egg ` notch ' -rrb- and for steam vegetable .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I just finish make my first cup of rice with this rice cooker and the only problem I have be that the exhaust vent on top spills\/boils over\/bubbles out -lrb- whatever you want to call it -rrb- , water . it make a slight mess on top and on my counter . I have only cook one cup so I do not know how much of a mess 20 cup would make .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I get this cooker about 2 week back . use the delay timer , prepare rice . it very nice to come home to a hot dinner . also the slow cook option be wonderful . just one pot multitasking . make biryanus use the slow cook option . its wonderful .
RiceCooker	POS	4	we be not sure we need a rice steamer after make rice several time a week on the stove top for 47 year , but we love it for white rice and be get use to it with brown . it be convenient and dependable .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be great ! cook the rice perfectly and keep it fresh for day ! Easy to use and easy to clean !
RiceCooker	POS	5	just back from a month long trip to Japan and love the convenience of use the rice cooker that be in all the apartment I stay at . I decide it be a must have and buy this item base on the great review it receive . I be absolutely thrill with this rice cooker . it really be just so simple to use & the rice quality be great each time . I have to admit that I have not try use the `` fast cook '' feature so can not comment on that . if you have a small family & do not need to regularly cook more than 2 cup of rice , this should do the trick .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I purchase this cooker in the beginning of February 2011 after read many review because I want the perfect one that be within my budget . the cooker arrive quickly but the first time I try it out , it just work ok but it keep switch itself on to warm even though the rice be definitely not cook . I try turn it back onto cook but it would not let I do it so I add some water , mix the rice and close the lid , it then let I put it on cook . it do this a few time , in the end of a long wait , the rice be cook and taste pretty good . I try this cooker a few time and it do the same thing , so I contact amazon and return it for a exchange of the same machine . I think it might be defective and want to give it another chance . Amazon give I a prepaid return label for I to print out and I choose to have UPS come to my home to pick it up , Amazon send out a replacement . the UPS guy arrive around noon the follow day and pick up the return , about 10 minute later , Fed ex arrive with my replacement . I be impressed ! I immediately wash the inner bowl , steam tray , measure cup and spoon and put it to the test . I make a batch of rice , the minimum amount which be 2 cup raw rice , set my own timer and in exactly 20 minute , the rice be completely cook , nice and fluffy , it be perfect ! a lot of steam come out of the lid when I open it . I make more rice , this time make 3 cup and it cook in about 35 minute , the machine do need a little water add and mixed and back onto cook . this really work very well and I be very satisfied with it . no more cooking rice on the stove for I , I will recommend this rice cooker to anyone look for a good affordable machine . I have not yet use the veggie tray but will be try it out next .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I be really satisfy with this and its price its really cheap n better than in any other store .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy this rice cooker a week ago and can not stop use it . so far I have make the best brown rice that I have taste in my home . we have also be use this machine to make Biryani -lrb- which come out excellent -rrb- , steel-cut oatmeal with blueberry , and chicken soup . if you need a machine that can make a wide variety of slow cook food , as well as excellent rice , then I highly recommend this machine .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be wonderful . you throw in the rice some water and forget about it . then in about a hour you have great rice . also have a delay timer and will keep the rice warm for hour . it sing ` twinkle twinkle little star ' when its do . very convenient
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker\/steamer be a excellent buy . could not ask for more at this price . fast and easy - love it - smile
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be a very nice rice cooker . the 1st one I receive - work once , and then start burn the rice after that . contact aroma customer support . they representative be very cordial and helpful and instruct I to return the cooker since it be malfunction -lrb- the cooker screen display a `` c1 '' and the cooker would not turn off -rrb- . I return to Amazon for replacement with no problem . the 2nd unit work great , and cook brown rice excellently ! it do take longer than my previous rice cooker . brown rice take from 100 to 105 minute to cook . it also require less water than my previous cooker which be a surprise to I . I hope to cook many a cup of rice with this cooker -lrb- if it continue to function well -rrb- .
RiceCooker	POS	5	my first rice cooker ! cute as a dang button . Plays I a song when cooking begin and end . small footprint , quality material , adorable logo ... and the rice be not bad either . it cheer I up immediately . Worth the price !
RiceCooker	POS	5	it cook rice perfectly , and keep warm quite well . the rice , depend on the grain , do get a little too hard above 4 or 5 hour of the `` keep warm '' function , and inedibly so after 8 hour . when this happen , I just add a little water and press the cook button again . it will rehydrate the rice quickly -lrb- much faster than have to cook the rice from scratch -rrb- and automatically switch to the warm function . I cook rice almost daily , and find that the cooking time and quality be above average . the interface be very easy to use , and do much to enhance the functionality and design of the machine . I have have the cooker for a month now , and it be still work as new . other have note that it do not come with a rice paddle holder , which may be a hassle to some , but do not bother I in the slightest . the plastic paddle be textured such that the rice rarely hang onto it . the paddle then can then be leave directly on the countertop without leave bit of gunky rice behind . as a student , I have little time to prepare meal . I find that this rice cooker make delicious meal in no time at all - like a pressure or slow cooker . I have also use it to make curried rice with vegetable and chicken . just through it all in and let it cook . I be go to go for the zojirushus 3.5 as this be the one my parent own and suggest , but I find this one cheaper and more good look . and the rice be just as good ! I would highly recommend this product to anyone choosing between these two model .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	Update 30 November 2011 : DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . as of 8 month ago , the nonstick coating on the rice cooker pot start come loose . I think nothing of it , because it be minor scratch . over time , the nonstick start flake off into the food , so I start to get nervous . I call the part people , who inform I that the part be no longer there , and be discontinue . funny how the rice cooker be still be sell at full price . in other word , after about two year , you 'll start lose the nonstick , and you will not be able to replace it . in other word , this thing have last I all of three year flat , and I can not replace something that should be a relatively simple thing to replace . what be worse be that Sanyo 's customer service be nonexistent . I can not find the number to call they customer service directly . thing be not be build like they use to be . I should have spend the tiny bit extra , and buy the Zojirushi . that be what I 'll be do next . thanks for the horrible customer service , Sanyo . I 'll never be buy from you again . other annoyance : I make brown rice all the time . the cooker always default back to white rice , rather than remember my last choice . it also take a extra 30 minute longer than rice should take . brown rice take close to 90 minute , not 45 , like I be use to . White rice take at least 45 minute . over time , the sensor must be go wonky , because in spite of my measure perfectly each time , the cooker err on the side of mushy . the number on the inside be write in ink , and not stamp into the pot . this mean that the number rub off . where do they go ? Into my food , clearly . I be very careful with my rice cooker , because it cost a fortune , and the thing be use literally every day . I only wash it with mild dish soap , and a soft sponge . it never go in the dish washer , because we have no dish washer . so now , the simple task of measure my rice be a huge pain , because I have to squint to see the number 's impression . the lid that fit over top of the pot , and as a liner to the lid of the cooker start to get gross look over the course of 3 month or so . again , they be never place in the dish washer . the entire machine be shoddily make , and I be furious at be stupid enough to spend that kind of money .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be very happy with the Zo rice cooker . it make perfect brown , white and black rice and the timer function be very convenient . the only problem I have be make oatmeal with the porridge cycle , follow a recipe in the Beth Hensperger rice machine cookbook , which cause a boil over . the material that come with the machine suggest use the white rice cycle to make oatmeal so I 'll try that next time . the other thing I would suggest be to buy the larger , 5 1\/2 cup model instead of the 3 cup , because it make such great rice you 'll probably want a lot ! overall a excellent product , very easy to clean , attractive stainless steel finish and do not take up much counter space . would recommend to a friend .
RiceCooker	POS	5	very pleased with the perfect rice this machine produce . the slow cooker option work very well also . this machine look great on the counter and do not take up much space .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy this small rice cooker -lrb- yes , it be small -rrb- for the use for 1-2 people . I have use it several time , along with my roommate and decide to post a review . just a quick note -- it be not a true 3 cup as claim by the 1 star reviewer . cooking : just add the measure rice and water , and put the lid on . Easy , and it cook automatically and switch to warm mode automatically . set it and forget it . occasionally , its best to stir after it switch to warm mode to avoid small bit of browning -lrb- which really be not a problem for I -rrb- . the rice cook perfectly in about 25-30 minute . there be a include handy guide for various type of rice and even other thing you can cook . clean-up : this be nearly effortless thanks to the non-stick bowl . I have have no issue what-so-ever . recommendation : this rice cooker be small , so its wonderful for apartment or small space . a full size amount of rice and water make a hearty serve for 1 person . I usually have to put away left-over . it be wonderful for 2 people ! -lrb- so unless you be one of those people who can eat a big Mac , 20 Piece Nuggets , and a large fry in one sit , I would not recommend it for you . -rrb- love , love , love this little cooker : -rrb-
RiceCooker	NEU	3	nice and compact . too much water drip from rid and you need to wipe it every time you open the warmer . older version of rice cooker\/warmer have little cup outside to receive warter but this one deposit warter around rim . Wish it have better way to receive escape warter .
RiceCooker	POS	4	well , the price of this , be not that high , that be maybe why it be a little hard to cook good rice . and it do its job to steam all the vegetable . good .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	inexpensive product . cook well for about one month . first gripe be that the cooker arrive with minor damage , the kind that be cause by Amazon shipping . the void space in the shipping box be fill with a small amount of paper , which do not protect the product . the spoon holder plastic loop be crack and there be a small ding in the inner pot . item be still functional and Amazon back the product and provide a discount . however , the product stop cook properly after about one month . spend the extra money for a better product and avoid aroma cooker .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	always under cook the rice , and with no control of when its on or off , you cant control the steam , unusable for vegetable , unusable for rice , very unhappy with this product
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy this because I have a rice cooker before that be great for my family and since its just I and the cat these day this little rice cooker be just perfect . it be quick and make nice rice , I may try it with a little less water next time to make a firmer rice for fried rice . I like that it heat up other `` stuff '' too .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be a nice , basic rice cooker . I have want to get a rice cooker for some time but debate what size and model to get . the size be perfect for one or two people , and the steamer addition allow you to prep veggy and other food to complement you meal . I have be able to cook other grain and bean like quinoa and lentil , respectively , with great result . one word of advice : make sure to use the cooker in a open area to quickly clean up water splatter and to avoid steam from potentially damaging kitchen cabinet .
RiceCooker	POS	5	we try the cheaper model from the same brand and return it . this one work perfectly , especially for cooking very small quantity of rice . could not be happier , and yes , it do employ fuzzy logic when cook the rice . do not buy a cooker without that feature . and everything from this brand be usually very high quality . this one be no exception . if you be a serious cook , this be the entry level . do not go any cheaper . note that it only cook 3 cup . Perfect for those who like rice but may not want so much of it . for two people , we have find that 1 cup be enough to satisfy we craving for rice dish for two , without pump up we waistline . it be very easy to use . they give you a measure cup and you measure the rice with the line on the cup -lrb- we use 1\/4 cup per person , but most will probably want 1\/2 cup per person -rrb- , then dump it into the bowl that be include in the thing . next , add water -lrb- some people will stir the rice with they finger -rrb- and pour the water back out to rinse the rice . some of the hull from the rice will float off when you pour the water out . rinse twice , then fill the water back up to the mark correspond to the amount of rice you have in there . yes , you add water to the mark with the rice inside . put the bowl in the unit and close the lid . next you push menu to select the type of rice you have -lrb- white , brown , sushi , etc. , use porridge for steel cut oatmeal -rrb- and push start . if you want to use the timer , instead of push start , push timer , use the arrow to set the time -lrb- it start with the last time you use -rrb- and then push start . the only knock I have be that it take a \* long \* time to cook 1 cup of rice . 40 minute just seem like it be twice as long as it should take . however , because I do not know whether that be longer than other fuzzy logic rice cooker , I do not take a star away from the product . just be forewarn , it take a lot longer than cooking rice on a stove . be it underpowered ? I do not know . the flip side be that it only take 450 watt to run the thing , and so it be less likely to pop the circuit breaker if you have something else go . a little off topic , but if you be look at a rice cooker , you may want to learn about rice . here be what we have learn so far . there be three basic grain size of rice : long grain , medium grain and short grain , also know as sweet rice or sushi rice . each kind have its place . long grain rice be best for fried rice and pilaf - where the rice should not stick together because you want every grain to be coat with a flavoring . by itself , long grain rice be not that great tasting . we Americans be use to long grain rice , but wait until you branch out into other type . medium grain rice be for serve just plain rice , like as a side dish with chinese dish . it be easily the best tasting rice by itself . it clump together to a degree , make it easier to eat with chopstick . if you want the most delicious rice you can find , and you will not be flavor it , buy medium grain . it be so much better than that long grain minute rice we grow up with . finally , sushi rice be very short grain and clump like mad . it be generally limit to sushi , where you would be willing to sacrifice flavor to get better clumping , and sweet dish , because of its high starch content . this rice cooker have a special setting for short grain rice . but I find short grain rice to be too artificial tasting , and so even for sweet dish , I use medium grain rice . next , there be two basic type of rice : brown rice , which be how all rice start , or white rice , which be brown rice with essentially all of the nutrient remove . with no nutrient , white rice do not spoil like brown rice can . we have find very little difference in taste between brown rice and white rice . if you do not like brown rice , you be probably think of a exotic variety that have a deeper taste . regular brown rice you buy in the store be very nearly the same taste as white , so we have stop buy white . find Botan Calrose brown rice in a asian market , look at the health advantage of brown rice on the internet and you 'll never go back . note , there be a special setting on the cooker for brown rice , and different water mark for brown , and brown rice take about 80 -lrb- not a typo -rrb- minute to make one cup . I be sure you can find more detail on line , but that should give you the basics . Ditch you long grain rice : you 'll be amaze at how much better medium grain rice can be . and try brown rice : you 'll be shock at how close it be to the nutrient-less white rice . this cooker make all kind of rice really well . I have have it for about three year and we use it nearly every day . it be still work like the day we get it . the nonstick bowl look and act like new . the battery keep all of the setting and the current time , though my understanding be that the battery be not easily replaceable without send it back .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be a perfect rice cooker for my home , since we eat a lot of rice . very efficient and elegant style . can also steam veggy while cooking rice , so serve dual purpose . great buy for the price it be offer !
RiceCooker	POS	5	this product be great !! we use it at least twice every day and it make perfect rice every single time . whole family love it !
RiceCooker	POS	4	the instruction be not the best so first time user may use too much water . -lrb- my spouse do -rrb- in short : add dry rice to bowl , then add water , pour out , add water , pour out , etc. to rinse about 4 time . use the supply plastic tool as a sieve . then with the WET RICE STILL in the bowl add water to the bowl indicator line . do not use some typical rule of thumb like 1 cup water per cup rice . when cook , stir rice in bowl immediately . I would have give 5 star but steam and some yuck come out the top vent .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy a earlier version of this rice cooker a couple of year ago and have be delighted with it . base on my recommendation , two friend have buy they . and I myself just buy a third one -lrb- the new version -rrb- as a present for another friend . nothing to add to the positive comment from other in this forum . we have not check out the bread-making capability yet , but the new one make rice and steel-cut oatmeal just as well as the old one . my one small complaint be that it be difficult to clean next to the hinge . but that be minor , compare to the cooker 's overall quality and convenience . for what it be worth , my favorite everyday rice by far be Kokuho Rose rice , which cook perfectly in the Sanyo . you can buy the rice at any asian food store , and at many supermarket that have a large `` international food '' section .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	I have be use this 2-3 time a week when it finally break . needless to say , I be not happy . I only pay $ 15 for this so I guess you get what you pay for .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I grow up with rice cooker that do a poor job . so when my neice want one I try to buy a good one . so far , happy report of good rice , no boil over and easy for a single mom , five in house to feed , to use and clean . what else do we need ?
RiceCooker	NEG	1	this rice cooker arrive and nothing on it work ; no light , no menue , no clock ; nothing ! when plug in it seem that there be a master switch that be in the off position . we could not locate one and the manual make no mention of a switch . it be just dead . Amazon make it fairly easy to return and we appear to have receive a full refund . we do , however , decide to use another source to purchase a replacement .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this cooker be purchase about a month ago specifically for cooking brown rice . I typically cook a pot of brown rice each week . I have use it 3 or 4 time so far . it do a great job cooking brown rice , far better than when it be cook in a pot on the stove . less water be use than with stove top cooking . the rice come out more consistently `` fluffy '' and more evenly cook . I be experiment a little with the exact amount of water to use and think I will wind up use a little more than be recommend in the recipe supply with the cooker . the cooker be easy to use , just add the rice and water to the pot , plug it in , push one button , and come back about 90 minute later . the cooker switch to the warm setting when the rice be do . so , its not a problem if you be a little late get back to the cooker . clean up be easy . there be a thin `` sticky '' layer on the bottom of the no-stick cooking pot after the rice be remove . but , it come out easily with a little soak . all in all this be a great cooker .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love this rice cooker and have use it to cook western style white rice , brown rice , indian Basamati rice , Jasmine rice , and other asian rice , and even so-called `` Wild Rice '' and a few other and never have the burning problem other have note . sound like they be not use enough water . I do not usually need to stir it after boil start either . the glass cover make it easy to check on thing without removng the cover -lrb- and change the cooking cycle -rrb- ; it do not really seem to make much difference . it can not be beat for $ 15 and be perfect for one or two people . the con be that it do not have a timer and you must unplug it to stop the keep warm . you can scoop the rice out of the pot or easily remove the port though there be no handle on the pot so you need a couple pot holder to remove it . it shut itself off automatically if the pot we remove . cleanup could not be easier . the pot remove and wash up in soap and warm water . I have never have anything stick hard enough to require scour . of course , I always clean or fill with water in the sink after use it so it do not get a chance to glue itself to the pot . it also steam vegetable perfectly and , once again , the glass cover be a real plus . the cover fit well enough to keep the vapor in the pot . if you need more capacity , consider the 6 or 12 cup model but they have a metal cover . bottom line , the cooker be perfect for one or two people for all kind of rice and steam vegetable .
RiceCooker	POS	5	after get it I be able to easily cook sushi rice as well as accurately gauge how much rice to cook for four people without waste . I have yet to burn a batch and the item itself be idiot proof , flip the switch and go find something else to do . the warmer function work as advertise and I have be able to successfully leave the rice in for over a hour with no adverse effect . highly recommend !
RiceCooker	POS	4	I use this little rice cooker 4-5 time a week , as I eat quite a bit of rice -lrb- but not daily as some user who rate it lower do -rrb- . it have work flawlessly for several year now . I have even drop this unit hard enough to put a dent in it and it still work just fine . the non stick surface have hold up well -lrb- I be typically not very careful about non stick surface -rrb- and have a few scratch that be my fault , but the rest of the coating remain intact . the only reason I do not give this the full five star be that I do not know how they get 6 cup of cook rice out of this . if I try to cook 3 cup uncook it overflow , but for smaller amount it work just fine . I do not know , maybe I need new measure cup ...
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I recently buy this rice cooker but return it co it be very small than expect . the product info say it be a 3 cup rice cooker but please be aware that it be 3 cup of cook rice , or 1.5 cup of uncooked rice . most of the rice cooker in the market I have see describe they rice cooker in cup in term of uncooked rice .
RiceCooker	POS	5	the Zojirushi ns-lac05 3-cup be the best rice cooker I have ever use . it be not the `` first '' , but definitely the `` best . '' I recommend it to everyone I can . we have rice now at least 3 time per week .
RiceCooker	POS	5	my old Panasonic rick Cooker break down after 5 year , back than , that rick cooker cost I more than $ 50 to buy . now when I come to buy it at Amazon.com I do not expect to pay much less and can get the same function , even the look be the same . I be very happy and hope this one will last .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be nice rice cooker , especially for one person . I have have this rice cooker for 3 year now and it be such a time saver . I put in 1 cup of brown rice and 2.5 cup of water and press down on the `` on '' button and leave it . it be so simple ; now I do not to worry about burn my rice . if you have rice `` stick '' on this , try add a 1\/4 cup more water . that should do the trick . -lrb- note : if you use white rice , the ratio 1 cup rice to 2 cup water . -rrb- it also have a nice steamer , so you can steam vegetable at the same time . it have a small `` footprint '' so it do not take up a lot of room . it do the job and be inexpensive . one thing I do notice be the power cord length be on the short side , but I be very satisfied .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be amazing ! I use it constantly and would highly recommend it for the cook on the go ! I absolutely love it !
RiceCooker	POS	5	retractable cord be a plus . Easy to use and clean . very high build quality . Extra pan and lid liner , steamer tray include . I have mainly use this for rice and soft-boiled egg . I like be able to load rice in the morning and have hot rice ready when I get home from work . need to use the second pan and try some of the recipe in the cookbook . the excellent quality of this unit and the result with the rice , would probably push I purchase the Sanyo ecj-px50 pressure rice cooker available on Amazon .
RiceCooker	POS	4	its really a awesome rice cooker for 2 person . smaller one and keep the rice warm for quite some time . and easy carriable too .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have never own a rice cooker before so I find this wonderful . I just dump in the rice and water and then push a button and ta da ! it work great for my family of 4 - make just enough rice and be small enough that it do not take up a lot of space in my kitchen cabinet . however , like the one star review say , it do stick to the bottom -lrb- we just soak overnight after use -rrb- and probably do not produce the correct consistency for a rice connoisseur . but for a novice like I I find it a great addition to we kitchen !
RiceCooker	POS	4	I buy the rice cooker after debate the purchase for 2 year and shop around . pro : - make perfect rice - can make other grain in it - make fantastic and easy risotto - insert can go in dishwasher - have button for brown rice con : - release lot of steam , do not put on counter under cabinet - after use , need to sit open to dry out before put away - do not have timer , only preset button for brown rice , white rice and steam - have to use rice cup instead of normal measure cup overall I love this rice maker and will continue to use it . Hope it work for a long time !!!
RiceCooker	POS	4	this rice cooker work very well . the only trick be to make sure you use the supply cup to measure the rice -- it be not a full US 8oz measure . however , you may still want to use a bit less water than the pot indicate to obtain firmer rice -- that be we preference anyway . we find ourselves eat more rice than before -lrb- use to cook in a pot -rrb- , as it all come out plump and not too sticky . now , we be experiment with mixed brown and white to compensate for the increase . the control be simple enough , although the direction be not as clear which line to use for water . it be all easy to figure out , though .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker\/slow cooker do a great job cooking rice of every kind and work great as a slow cooker ... this two in one appliance belong in every kitchen ... you will not be sorry if you add this rice cooker\/slow cooker to you kitchen ... it will make you smile every time you use it ...

RiceCooker	NEU	3	not much to say about this one ... it make rice . it also make one heck of a mess . the steam outlet on the lid like to spew starchy water in about a 8 '' cone in front of the appliance , make cleanup a nightmare .
RiceCooker	POS	5	have grow up with a one-button rice cooker , I be look for a more sophisticated multi-functional rice cooker and find it in the Sanyo ecj-hc55 . I use it regularly for white rice and brown rice . the timer functionality make cooking rice a breeze . Rice come out consistently perfect every time . meal planning be not a issue since I can set the timer to cook the rice just before I get home . no more wait around for the rice to be ready ! what I really love about this device be its slow cooker functionality . bean , lentil and beef stew all come out tender and tasty with minimal work . the only feedback I have about it be that the instruction manual have very little on the slow cooker functionality and minimal guideline on how much liquid to add , as well as which setting should be use -lrb- high\/low-temperature slow cooking -rrb- for what item . I have have my device for 6 month and have no complain so far . clean and cooking be a breeze !
RiceCooker	NEG	2	I buy this cooker in May 2011 , and have use it at least twice a week ever since . within 2 month , the steamer tray become very warped . in addition , the cooker make a huge mess every time i use it . it do not seem to do it as bad when cooking white rice , but since I cook mostly brown rice and quinoa , it get sticky watery mess all over the place . I think we could deal with it , but my counter be get stain ! Time to replace the cooker !
RiceCooker	POS	4	the rice come out fabulous . it be also great for steel cut oatmeal . however , the timer be extremely confusing . out of 5 college graduate -lrb- engineer , phd 's -rrb- , only one figure it out . I even write the company 3 time . I own a Zojirushi Bread maker also , and that timer be straight forward . the rice cooker use a 24 hour clock , -- very confusing . if it have not be for the timer I would have give it 5 star . also , a steamer button would have be nice , but that model be even more expensive .
RiceCooker	POS	5	we have have this rice cooker for a month and have use it 4 time . I experience none of the problem that a small number of review indicate . with that in mind , this be one of those thing that perform so well that you wonder how it could be such a bargain .
RiceCooker	POS	5	we family eat rice everyday . older rice cooker be about $ 500 . so I worrird about quality since this rice cooker be so reasonable . to tell the truth , this rice cooker make same quality to my expensive old one .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I do notice in other review that this 3 - `` Cup '' rice cooker refer to a cup that be not actually a cup . turn out that it be 3\/4 of a cup . also to cook brown rice you be restricted to just 2 `` cup '' which be actually then just one and 1\/2 of a cup , which I be sorry to say be not a lot . I be also unhappy to learn that there be no setting for sticky rice . it do make great rice .
RiceCooker	POS	4	this be a gift for a friend who use she old rice cooker til it die . she tell I it work great , nothing stick , and it look great too !
RiceCooker	POS	5	so far , we have only use the unit as a rice cooker . have not yet try the slow cooker since we just take it out of the box a week ago . move in to a new house and the Sanyo ecj-hc55 look great in the kitchen . match well with the Stainless Steel appliance . the rice cooker have work flawlessly since we put it to use . so easy to operate , material look very well make . hopefully it last a long time .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I rcvd this product earlier then what be quote , which be great ! I be very happy ... until i open the package and realize it be miss the Bowl to cook product in . I contact the vendor to see if maybe they could send I one , i be willing to pay for it too . however Rachel at Black and Decker state that they no longer make this product -lrb- hence price -rrb- and that i should return it to purchase a different model as this one be know to be `` defective '' the only reason why i give this a 3 , be for shipping . other then that i can not say if this work for I or not . = -lrb-
RiceCooker	POS	4	this rice cooker be just the very size that I want as I be cooking only for myself . it cook quite efficiently and the rice taste just good !
RiceCooker	POS	4	buy this as a present . the recipient , early 20 's college student , love the practicality , ease , and convenience . Perfect rice everytime .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I get what I think be one of the better rice cooker for my boyfriend for Christmas . I go thru the trouble of have it ship in for the holiday as we be go skiing . we get it home and try it out . we be so excited . each time we use it , it make a huge mess all over the counter top no matter how much we make or how little we make . finally we give up and try this one . it have be a dream . we have make all different kind of rice , grits , oatmeal , and no fuss , no mess . it even have a fast cook set that we use most of the time - we do not plan for dinner quite well enough to do it the long way . the fast cook method be just as great . we have be creative and try some of we own recipe and make thing up . no mess , no fuss ! the instruction book that come with the cooker be not great but be creative . it have be great and so easy . we both laugh when the little tune play as you begin and end cooking cycle . it be worth a bit extra to spend to get a great product . thanks Amazon for you great policy as well . I highly recommend this cooker and we be tough on thing . it have be great !
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I love this cooker . we get it as a wedding gift and now that we have be marry 3 and a half year it stop work . I would expect it to last longer than that . we only use 1-2 time a month and only make 2-3 cup of rice at a time . go to buy a different brand this time .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Effective & inexpensive rice cooker . prepare softer grain rice -lrb- Thai Jasmine -rrb- to perfection . Black , brown , & red variety use more water & take longer to cook . spray a small amount of oil in the bottom of the removable , aluminum pot to help prevent sticking . Automatic thermostat switch to warm when do , keep rice warm for hour .
RiceCooker	POS	5	before buy this , I be use a american brand rice cooker -lrb- the most terrible experience ever -rrb- . this one be great ! cooking rice in the way I want ! the only thing be that there be too much steam leave on the lid once the rice be do .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I almost do not buy this because most of the recent review be bad . then I read they and it seem like most of they be bad because of the size . since I just want a rice cooker to make a small amount , not family size , this be perfect for what I need it for . I be so glad I do buy it . it be perfect . I use the cup that come with it to measure my rice and water , and it turn out perfect . as long as you realize that this be not a large rice cooker and be good for just 1 or 2 serving , you will not regret buy this .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love this rice cooker . this be the best rice cooker I ever have with excellent value . make great rice every time . it come with ` Steam Tray ' as well which be `` great '' . fast cooking ! , it only take 13 ~ 15 minute to cook white rice . reasonable price for such a high quality product with Free Shipping . most excellent choice for the rice cooker and I highly recommand to everyone .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be a awesome rice cooker , and do exactly what it be suppose to : make great rice . I usually use mine to make brown rice . I use the Mahatma brown rice . my only complaint be that the instruction for the Zojirushi be cryptic and confusing . in case it help anyone else , here be how you make basic brown rice with this cooker : 1 . -rrb- one plastic measure cup -lrb- 100 ml -rrb- full of brown rice , pour in bowl . 2 . -rrb- Bowl : fill water to 1 under `` brown rice '' . 3 . -rrb- Make sure arrow on display be on `` brown '' . 4 . -rrb- Press pink `` cooking '' button . this will give you perfectly cook brown rice in about a hour and a half . if you do not want you rice to be too bland , throw a chicken bouillon cube or two in before you shut the lid and press the cooking button . I use my brown rice as a side dish , or put it in soup or even Wendy 's chili for a inexpensive meal .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Works great for I . I steam vegetable and rice at time . also I have hard boil egg in it . I use it about 3 time a week . look like a million dollar also . Easy clean too .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I give my adult child these Zojirushi rice cooker for Christmas gift last year . yesterday -- while do some holiday shopping for this year -- both of they comment about how much they love the cooker . they be very impressed with how good the rice always turn out and how easy it be to clean the interior bowl .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Works great , just like a rice cooker ought to . not a steamer , as some other review have mention . good size for we -lrb- a couple with no kid -rrb- , and small enough to fit in we tiny kitchen . also nice that it do not have pink flower on top . sometimes spit a little when open it too quickly -lrb- but most rice cooker be prone to that if they
RiceCooker	POS	5	affordable and I be very satisfied with this product . I can bring it easily everywhere I go . do not know how long will it last work .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I recently buy this beautiful cooker . Rice be well cook , do not stick to the pot . make scoop and serve easy . only thing that i be not quite comfortable be that after the cooking mode it automatically go to warm mode , which can only be turn off by unplug the cable .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Ilove my new rice cooker . cook up to 3 cup of raw rice and come out perfect everytime . in south Louisiana we eat a lot of rice so I know what good rice taste like . I do wash the rice  Oster 4722 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Steamer - red  use this for about one month so far ... it clean in warm sudsy water with no problem . just remember to NOT use metal spoon .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I have purchase this rice cooker almost a week ago and it just completely stop cooking . first I trust the company because they be big and they produce lot of different product in different area but this rice cooker be just a total disappointment . the problem be , it just stop work and the light be not on . I unplug it and plug it back nothing change . I clean every part of it and still nothing change . it be not the only problem . it say 3 cup rice cooker , well it be not regular 3 cup , it have this small cup come with the cooker , that cup be they measurement . my point be , it can only cook 1.5 cup of rice only . when you look at the picture carefully you will see that some other brand call `` aroma '' have a bigger rice cooker and it be also a 3 cup cooker . I buy a kettle of that brand and it be work like a champ now about rice cooker clearly I make a mistake . I just pay some money for the brand . as a result of this , I only have a piece of metal junk in my kitchen now . probably people will just read the 5 star rate message and decide to buy the product . I be sure those people have no problem with this product but why would you take that risk and waste you money eventually ? my suggestion be stay away from this rubbish ...
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I buy this 2 1\/2 yr ago base on good review . now the non-stick coating start to peel off . I have handle it with tlc all the while . I have use many rice cooker before . after 5 or 6 year , they will have some kind of discolor at bottom of inner pot , but never the peel . and they be 1\/4 of the price I pay for this Sanyo product .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	good and affordable product for someone who do not cook rice frequently . for someone like I who eat rice almost daily , this rice cooker dry out my rice if leave on overnight . the cooker automatically turn on `` cook '' after certain number of hour , instead of keep the rice in warm mode like some other expensive japanese brand , where you can leave rice in cooker for a couple of day .
RiceCooker	POS	5	cook the best rice than ever ! very small and do the job for a sweet couple for they 1st anniversary !
RiceCooker	POS	4	like the color ; the bright red match the rest of my kitchen stuff . and it be just the right size for two people . not for more people . get something else if you require a rice cooker for larger gathering .
RiceCooker	POS	5	make excellent rice for chinese food and japanese sushi . convenient and easy to use . highly recommede .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker in incredible . all claim be valid . imagine make sushi rice while you be out walk , or gardening . just push a button ... it be a simple as that . no more bubble over ; no more mess to clean up . even my husband , who never cook , be intrigue . it be expensive , but life be short and I have better thing to do than watch rice simmer .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I love the convenience of this cooker but I find that it take twice as much water as the instruction call for to obtain tender , fluffy rice . the first few time I use it I put the recommend amount of water in and find the rice would burn before the cycle be complete . other than that this be a handy little product .
RiceCooker	POS	5	it be not Rocket Science ! all Rice cooker be the same . put the Rice in ... add some water ... . . Voila Cooked Rice . Easy to use Rice Cooker , just plug and play . .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be seriously the best rice cooker I have ever see . it seal when you close it so it do not make a mess . I have use it on all kind of different rice and it make they perfectly every single time and do not burn even one grain of rice . I love the little attachment to hold the rice spoon thingie . buy this if you be look for a rice cooker , you will not regret it .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I use to have a Zojirushi rice cooker before it break . this one be no be near that good with quality or the way it cook rice . however for the price it be a great little rice cooker . Easy to clean and use . I would say the only real drawback be that be do tend to burn rice on the bottom of the pot if you do not watch and stir occasionally . I usually end up add a quarter cup of water or so with brown or white rice to avoid burning . besides that work as advertise and you get what you pay for .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the first rice cooker that I have own , so I do not have anything to compare with . however , this be easy to use and do a wonderful job in cooking rice -- perfect every time . when I first receive it , I have several question so I call the 1-800 number and the representative be friendly and helpful in fully answer my question . I would not hesitate in purchase another aroma product or recommend one to a friend .
RiceCooker	POS	5	definitely worth the time look for it , and the money spend on it . : -rrb- I could not be more happy with it . Rice cook beautifully in it , and keep for QUITE a while . -lrb- we accidentally leave rice in there over the weekend once . it do not leave a smell or get all wet\/yellow or anything ! ... though we do not eat it . -rrb-
RiceCooker	POS	5	it be probably a little bigger than what I have expect or need , but who know when you might actually need 20 cup of rice . it also have a couple of nice feature that I do not expect . there be a steam condensate catcher on the back of the unit so that when you open the lid , it do not all run down the back of the unit . it detach easily for cleaning . also , mine come with a rice paddle so do not bother purchase a extra one because it be include . the cord be fairly long ... about 4 foot so that help with versatility in appliance placement . the first batch of rice I make be a brown , red , and long grain wild rice mix . it probably could have use just a touch extra water or perhaps I over fill the rice measurement cup . the brown and red rice be perfect but the long grain wild rice could have use a extra few minute or some extra water . probably a pitfall of mix different type of rice and not a shortcoming of the machine . the only drawback that I see be that the `` steam '' tray be make of plastic . I would have hope they would make it out of metal like the main rice compartment but I be more of a grill fan than a steamer fan so I probably will not use it anyway . all in all , pretty happy with the unit so far . Pretty much agree with the other positive review . the negative review about the capacity be a strange one . it yield up to 20 cup of cook rice from 10 cup of dry rice ... hope that clear up any confusion . enjoy and happy rice make !
RiceCooker	POS	5	small and extremely easy to use , it cook rice with excellent result . it be a very good investment , the Zojirushi will last forever !
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I buy this cooker while ago and I be very pleased with it . it do ' amazing work almost with everything you through inside and almost anything I mean not only rice , vegetable and steal cut oats ; also buckwheat , bean , millet groat and etc. . so far I just try to find out all possibility you can do with logic rice cooker . you may find plenty recipe online and most of they must be adjust to you type of rice cooker ; just play with it and try even it may take to repeat it 2-3 time , you will be please with outcome . I be . the only problem I do have with mine rice cooker be partially break or badly manufacture upper steam vent cap . how I notice ? simply you have to wash all part when you do cooking ... and that way I notice something like crack and later after longer investigation I will say that molding process do not finish well . I order replacement from Amazon ; it arrive very quickly , but guess what ???? New one have exactly the same issue like the previous one . it seem to I that entire series may have the same problem , so just be aware of it . Mine do work so far even with this problem . how long it will work ? I do not know . great product , I love it ... ... it have a issue !!!!
RiceCooker	POS	4	have be use the rice cooker for a few week by now . so far we have use it for regular white rice cooking . no problem at all . it produce soft and puffy white rice every time . try once on porridge , the result be not very satisfactory . the only complaint we have be that the non-sticking coat inside the inner rice cooking pan have be moderately scratch at arrival . the reason be probably that the factory simply put the measure cup and spatula in a thin plastic wrap and place they in the cooking pan . as a result , the scratch be make during shipping . if they have use some foam wrap instead , it would not have cause the scratch . I be surprise that this top-ranked rice cooker maker would not have think of this issue .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be the greatest contraption I have ever own . the many feature , especially the timer setting , make it convenient and easy for I to put the ingredient in before I leave for work and have they ready when I walk in the door . the cooking pot be non-stick , so it be extremely easy to clean . the rice cooker be easy to use , which be great , because we use it about 3 time a week !
RiceCooker	POS	5	buy this to make rice for my family of 4 . it make the perfect serve size . Doe not take much room . a little small to steam veggy -lrb- we like lot of veggy -rrb- . overall great cooker for the price .
RiceCooker	POS	4	the rice cooker be a gift for a relative . it be highly reocmmen by another relative from Japan . the fine print be IMPOSSIBLE to READ !
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be my very first rice cooker and I be extremely happy with it ! it work wonderfully and be not costly at all . I be in love .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have have mine several month now and I be very pleased with it ! we be a small family and I be able to cook the amount I need with this cooker . I be worry that I be spend too much for it but now I be glad I spend the extra money for this brand\/model . I want to cook oatmeal in it and it do the steelcut oats very well . the only problem we have be that my husband want plain oats and I keep add thing like fresh blueberry and vanilla when I start it . we do agree on the rice . we favorite at the moment be Bhutan red rice . Cook on brown rice setting and enjoy ! be sure to check you setting EVERY TIME and do not lose you measure cup . I measure the measure cup but I forget to write it down in my receipe book . I need to do that before I lose the cup . highly recommend . PS ... have anyone cook bean with rice in it yet ??
