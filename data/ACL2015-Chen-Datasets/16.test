Bag	NEU	3	I have two canon body with vertical grip , 2 flash , and three lens with another one on the way . they do not all fit . I have the 580 ex ii , 480 ex , 70 - 200 mm , 50 mm , and 17 - 40 mm -lrb- all l lens -rrb- for canon . I do not have enough space for the second flash or the 50 mm . I have to keep one camera body portable -lrb- which be fine for out on assignment , but not when in storage -rrb- .
Bag	POS	4	most tote be a little dowdy , but I like the way this one look and feel . it be sturdy and it hold lot of stuff : from my computer to several book , file , and the all-important lunch .
Bag	NEG	2	this tool bag be high quality and durable , but I like my tool to stand up in pocket . you tool in this bag must lay flat in most all case . small tool and a small quantity may be put into pocket but in the most part you just have to through they in the bottom of the bag and dig .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this bag when they first come out cause I be tire of lug around that heavy laptop bag that weigh like it have a couple laptop in it even when mine be not in it : -rrb- this bag be durable , laptop area be cushion with a clasp so it cant fall out . zippered mesh inside pocket , it be get drag around across the US and still look new !!
Bag	POS	4	I go to a department store to find a camera bag , unfortunately they do not stock Targus . but I do come across the Case Logic dc50 case . I like it .  layout and size : it have a great accessory pouch -lrb- with mesh pocket , not sure how durable they be -rrb- . a zip pocket big enough for 2 canon battery and memory card , + another pocket for memory , and room for aa battery -lrb- if applicable -rrb- . there be padding everywhere as far as I could feel , although it be quite thin -lrb- all case I see have as thinner or thinner padding -rrb- . the inner -lrb- camera -rrb- pocket be approximately 15cm -lrb- 6in ? -rrb- high , 8cm -lrb- a bit more than 3in -rrb- wide and 4.5 cm -lrb- less than 2 in -rrb- deep -lrb- these be rough measurement with a ruler -rrb- .  for Canon S30 : \* it be a little large for the Canon s30 as you can tell from my rough measurement . however , with the all weather case it might be about right -lrb- do not know yet -rrb- . \* to give you a rough idea ... if the camera be still in bubble wrap then it be almost the right size -lrb- except for height -rrb- .  if you find a better case for the s30 , then let I know : - -rrb- otherwise I will happily use the dc50 case : - -rrb-  if the height be too big you could always put some extra padding down the bottom of the bag . for example just cut some bubble wrap to size and put it at the bottom of the comparment .
Bag	POS	4	I be look for a case for my Dewalt nailer . Dewalt do not offer one . Came across this bag and it be a perfect fit .
Bag	NEG	2	it amaze I that people be give this tool more than a one or two star rating . it can not be use for over 2 hour without begining to fail . it show that most user be either not use the tool long enough before give a review , or the normal project people use the tool for be very short duration . this sander be size and shape perfectly for easy handling and general all position use . when the sander be new I use it to sand a maple butcher block top . after a hour or so the sander be spit black graphite piece all over the white wood top stain the surface . the sander be hop around like the wheel be square ! I remove the belt to inspect the sander . the friction pad be disintegrate . the wheel be clump with fragment from the die pad . I have to finish the job with my old $ 49.00 Skil which be very light duty , but finish the job . I send the sander in to be repair under warranty . I get some resistance from the repair people , but they do put a new pad on , and replace a wheel . I have since use the sander for very light use type job of short duration . last week I have another job which require continuous use for 3 hour sand a fiberglass body panel flat . I use no down pressure only gravity to weight the sander . it last 2 hour before spit out carbon flake again . the wheel be cake with graphite lump again and the lead 25 % of the pad be wear down again . this pad design be lack for any project require continuous use over a hour or so . it look like I may need a heavier duty tool to use for any surface type job . this one be only good for sand edge or small lump off of surface . the cost be too high for such a light duty tool . I hope they abandon the carbon pad for future offering . the plastic back bone inside the dust bag fail on my sander also . it have small ear that attach to the inlet socket . the ear be very small diameter and lack robustness . I hope Bosch can refine this sander , as it be a good handling tool and would fit the need of many a craftsman .
Bag	POS	4	awesome tool bag . perfect size for drill and other tool that I prefer to carry . Heavy , durable canvas and no problem w\/zipper as other reviewer have claim . only downfall be that bottom of bag will sag - use 2 piece of cardboard wrap in duct tape to keep from sag .
Bag	POS	4	before puchase this tool bag , I take the time to read the review on this site . after receive and use it , I couldnt ' be more satisfied . it be everything I expect it to be . it have plenty of room and pocket to organize my tool and its nice not to have to dig down in the bottom of the bag to find the one you need . have not have it long enough to see how it will hold up , but it look to be very well construct . I plan on get another .
Bag	POS	5	although a seam fail shortly after start use of this toolbag , I think it be a anomaly because I have a GateMouth Longboy that have endure a lot of hard use and the replacement Jr. bag be hold up just fine . both bag be light-weight but very strong and easy to carry . I do use the pocket sew into the bag but find that a couple of inexpensive office supply store pencil box work well to orgainize and protect my smaller tool and supplies . the GateMouth line of tool bag be very good quality and I recommend it highly .
Bag	NEG	2	while a great concept , this dust collection bag prove of little worth to my dust collection effort . I find that hook my shop vac up to the dust ejection port on the back of my Bosch table saw be infinitely better than this bag , which only collect about 50-60 % of the sawdust
Bag	POS	5	this bag be rugged and large enough to easily fit my Hitachi Framing gun without any trouble . there be even room to put some other loose tool on top if you wish\/need to . the strap a tough and the correct size to carry over the shoulder at waist height . I be very glad I get this to help offer some protection to my frame gun -lrb- especially when load it into the truck , you know how everything end up pile on-top of everything else -rrb- . the only thing that could be better would be for frame gun to include hard case when you buy they -lrb- I do not know any maker who do so -rrb- . I highly recommend this product .
Bag	NEG	2	this be a well build product but it will just hold you camera and battery . it will not handle the cable need to support the camera or the power supply which be a must in most case . the battery do not last long enough for most outing . it be basically the size of a small hardcovered novel !
Bag	POS	5	firstly , let I say I get this sander from amazon for about 40 buck less than the sale price offer at local store ; plus free shipping . such a Deal ! this thing work great . Square shape make it easy to get up alongside wall . variable speed dial and lock button allow you to run the thing and put you hand anywhere on the sander . lot of speed and power . Easy on the hand . the dust bag attachment seem to work well , but be anything really dust proof ? I also put this thing upside down in a vise -lrb- with a towel around the vise jaw -rrb- and use it as a stationary sander . and for those who care , it be not make in Taiwan or China by underpaid foreign worker , but in Switzerland . hopefully by well-paid immigrant worker . I be not a contractor , so I haven ` nt torture test this thing , but if you be a homeowner who want to have the kid fight over you tool when you be go , or simply want to have a impressive estate sale , you can not beat this sander . it be way better to buy this baby and have it for life , rather than buy 50 buck sander from the hardware store every few year .
Bag	POS	5	... this case actually have a hidden rain jacket to protect you electronic equipment -lrb- worth probably hundred if not thousand of dollard -rrb- from the element . the inside material be also design not to scratch lcd display and it be quite a rugged case for such a little bag . oh and do I forget to mention that it have a belt loop on the back so you can wear it around you waist and that the hardware be metal instead of plastic . a bag that be really design to last . Great for digital still camera and a few accessore like card and a small battery charger or axillary lens . highly recomend for digital camera .
Bag	POS	4	I get this to store my Bostitch f21pl frame nailer  bostitch f21pl Round Head 1-1\/2 - Inch to 3-1\/2 - Inch Framing Nailer with positive Placement Tip and Magnesium Housing  it be a tight fit , but the zipper close and the frame nailer will be a lot happier in the bag , dust free , and hopefully free of the dent and ding it would receive it it be rattle around the back of my truck unprotected . I like the gunner bag and can recommend it . here be some point base on my use and observation : pro : \* size - this bag should fit just about any pneumatic nailer you have . the Bostitch I get it for be about as big as the other guy that shoot round head frame nail : Hitachi , Senco , Porter Cable , etc. . Mine fit best upside down , with the business end point toward the peak of the bag , on top . naturally , it will fit many smaller nailer , too , like a roofing nailer or a couple of finish nailer . \* well make - the material of the bag be rugged ripstop nylon and it seem to be put together well enough . stitch be mostly single and while the zipper be not particularly heavy duty -lrb- it be a nylon type - not metal -rrb- , it should last long enough . the handle be make of nylon webbing and will probably outlast other component of the bag . \* it be padded - I like this feature , for in addition to keep the dust off the tool , I also want the bag to afford it protection from bang and bump when it be ride along with my other tool in the back of the pickup . the side be not heavily padded , but it be enough to make a difference . while the bottom be not pad it do have a strip of rigid plastic run the length of the bag which should offer some protection as well . \* Versatile - The bag come with one pocket on the outside -lrb- which be where a bottle of my pneumatic tool oil life -rrb- and a couple of small pocket inside . give that it be already a tight fit inside for a full-size framing nailer and the fact that the interior pocket be fairly small , I do not see much practical purpose to these ; I would prefer to have another , larger , pocket on the exterior -lrb- perhaps with a closeable flap ? -rrb- where I could store the tip cover , sequential-fire trigger , etc. . the bag come with a nylon shoulder strap so you can carry the bag over you shoulder to free up you hand . this may or may not be useful depend on how you use the bag , but it be nice to have the option . con : \* value - this be purely subjective , but it seem that this bag should be less expensive than it be . be it handy ? yes , it be . be it essential ? well , no , I do not think it be . at the time of this writing , the bag represent about 13 % of the cost of the tool it be carry . I leave it to you to decide whether that be a good value or not . I have use Bucket Boss product in the past and they be still go strong , but that be carry dozen of tool , day in , day out , everywhere . this gunner bag be go to be carry one tool , occasionally , so the value proposition for I be not as sweet as it could be . \* gate mouth - I need to review the meaning of what gate mouth be , because I think that mean a opening that get bigger due to a semi-rigid opening that make the open to the bag much bigger . this bag do not have that , but instead it have a zipper that run the length of the bag . do it matter ? the zipper work just fine , and the bag swallow my framing nailer , so I guess not . still , my expectation be different from what the product actually be . -lrb- I 'll allow that I may be confuse about the meaning , for sure -rrb- other thought : I do not see this as a essential item , but it be nice to have depend on you use . I be a contractor , but not a full-time rough carpenter or framer , so I will not be use my framing nailer on a daily basis . in my shop , this gunner bag will be protect my tool from dust and bump until I use it again . if I be to use my frame nailer every day , I do not know that I would spend the money on protect the tool that would basically get use to death and then toss . professional framer , what do you think ? for this reviewer , this be a good and useful bag that I be happy I purchase . yes , I think it could have be have for less give that the quality be ok but not fantastic , the material be decent but not top quality -lrb- zipper -rrb- , and it be make in China . -lrb- not to knock China in this case , but while they manufacture this bag about as well as anyone , let 's face it : it cost the factory penny on the dollar to produce this item -rrb-
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this bag for a Sony trv30 camcorder and overall be happy with it .  pro : - small - light - weatherproof -lrb- havent actually test it yet , but the retractable hood be a nice touch -rrb-  con : - small - not enough pocket - when wear a t-shirt , the hair on my hand get catch up in the strap attachment -lrb- painful and annoying and I be not even that hairy ! -rrb-  overall , if the constraint dont scare you away , I think its a pretty nice bag .
Bag	POS	5	man , these bag be great ! I fit a lot of my personal tool in here and have to take some out because the whole be too heavy ! I love the durable cloth ; I love the shoulder strap ; but what I like most be the use of space . there be a neat set of strap on top for a 2 ' level . there be organizational pocket on the inside for pencil , chisel , and whatnot .  there be a lot of room . they be not kid when they say you can fit a sawzall in there .
Bag	POS	5	a excellent tool bag for my pneumatic gun . well make at a affordable price . I have use it for over a year , no problem .
Bag	NEU	3	product seem to work fine , however I would like the item to be exactly like the picture . the one that be send to I have a cheap look bag attach which do not look like the picture . it do not have the black support or even Bosch write on it anywhere . -lrb- say cheap generic bag if that be what you be go to include with the product -rrb-
Bag	POS	5	I be pleasantly suprised when my long heavy gauge jumper cable fit easily into this bag and now behind the seat be a lot neater ...
Bag	POS	5	this bag look great and now that i have use it for several day , I love it . I have be look for a ` general use ' bag forever . I need a bag that could act as a carry all and as a book bag , and laptop bag . its great . someone comment i think , on the weight distribution . it all depend on hwo you load the bag . I be carry at least 25 lb . in book today all day and it be fine . also all the neat little pocket be wonderfull . room for everything you need . only one little complaint , my Sprint PCS gen 1 phone be a little too tall for the cell pouch , but otherwise , great !
Bag	NEG	1	simple to install and pretty effective . the only draw back be that sliver of scap wood can easily block the `` sawdust tunnel '' that feed the dust into the catcher . empty easily .
Bag	POS	5	this little bag have extend the life of we camcorder in numerous fall off the table , drop , bang around in the trunk , etc. . nicely pad , have lot of storage for the extra such as more tape , charger , etc. . well worth every penny for this camcorder insurance !
Bag	NEU	3	well ... it look bigger in the picture . be Bosch I would have expect the material to be a little more durable . it do catch 60 to 70 percent of the sawdust as advertised but you have to empty the bag often . I feel it be not worth what I pay -lrb- $ 12 and change -rrb- . six or seven dollar would be a good price for this item .
Bag	POS	5	track excellent even on it be back . can run the belt right to the edge for tight corner . recommend despite the price .
Bag	POS	5	this be the third 3 '' belt sander I have own and it be by far the best . the 9903 be fairly light and the handle allow good control . it be indeed very quiet consider the power . I be very pleased at the 16 ' power cord . Belt change be not a problem . and boy do this thing suck - I mean excellent dust collection . sand belt tracking be good and easy to adjust . this be a very nice sander . I wish all of my purchase tool do what they be suppose to do .
Bag	POS	4	I look at both the smaller bag and this one and for the money I would purchase the larger size . the smaller one be quite a bit smaller and most people would be dissapoint .
Bag	POS	5	I store my jumper cable under the rear seat of my pick-up . if I ever need to move they , they get catch up in everything , and flop around like a angry snake . well no more . this tidy little bag be perfect . well make , perfect size for any gauge -lrb- I have 2 of they - the other one for my 2 gauge tractor-winch lead -rrb- . 5 star .
Bag	POS	4	we have find this to be a very convenient way of transport essential tool from one job to the next . the bag be roomy and be great for any kind of tool . we be presently use the bag to carry we battery operate circular saw , which fit very nicely into the bag .
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this Bosch belt sander to sand base board and other trim . the wood be all yellow Pine so far . I like the smooth running of the belt and the sander do not seem to work hard . I will be sand Oak trim in the future and that might work the sander , if it do not work as well on Oak I 'll be post another opinion . my only complaint be the power trigger be located such that when you pick up the tool you finger depress the trigger and so start the sander . of course I have learn to allow for this and now I do not pick it up as I would other power tool . oh ... I own other Bosch power tool , router , power hand see , and find they to be well make too . oh I purchase the the fence and stand for the sander , well worth the money . I look forward to use this sander for year to come . Larry
Bag	POS	4	this sander have plenty of power for its size , and the vacuum bag actually suck up quite a bit of the dust without spray it right back in you face . track be decent and the fact that the right side and top be flat and ready to be clamp down to any available surface make it great for occasional bench sanding . what I do not like be how off-balance it be -- it really like to roll toward the leave on account of the motor 's weight and it be pretty hard to tell whether or not you be hold it level until it be too late . compound this problem with the fact that the optional sand shoe\/frame be both $ 114 extra and discontinued and you have get some pretty heavy con . I make my own frame out of 3\/4 '' mdf , but it be obviously pretty heavy and not especially durable . I also have a problem with the placement of the speed adjustment knob -- it get coated in dust almost instantly and become impossible to read without a shot of compress air . I worry about how long it will last before the potentiometer fizzle out . there seem to be a awful lot of review of belt sander from all manufacturer where customer complain about Amazon ship they a use unit as new . I too suspect this have happen to I upon open the box as mine be cover in what appear to be sawdust . a closer inspection however reveal that this be in fact just cardboard that have get sand by the belt as the unit be throw around during shipping . no harm , no foul . if you plan on do a lot of leveling , I would consider the DeWalt as you can pick up they frame just about anywhere . otherwise , there be quite a bit of bang for you buck here . it look boxy and awkward , but those bad look really add to the versatility of the machine . UPDATE : just talk to Makita on the phone and they confirm that the sand shoe accessory be no longer be make by anyone and they have no plan to design or produce a replacement model . Boo .
Bag	POS	4	this be a great item . however , I find it a bit small in diameter for a set of serious cable .
Bag	POS	5	this Bucket Boss be very functional for automotive use and be a top quality construction . I recommend they product !
Bag	POS	5	great sander . lightweight , great if you have to one hand something or if you have to sand vertically or overhead . the tracking adjuster work like a champ . change belt be super fast and easy . only complaint be the dust-bag ... it seem kind of cheesy compare to how well build the rest of the sander be , but I buy a sander , not a dust collector . make in Switzerland .
Bag	POS	5	I be pretty skeptical before buy this , but the review be all great , so i try .  and this be a very good stuff : I can put my dell notebook there and some book , plus a few shirt to tavel overnight . I even use to to go to office .  this be just the good bag i need . very highly recommend .
Bag	POS	5	I now have two Bucket Boss , Jr. bag and I find they to be the perfect size and rugged . the bigger these satchel be , the more I try to stuff into they , which end up with too heavy a bag and too much stuff dump in it . I like have smaller , label carryall so I can stay organize , even when I be work quickly .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this sander for heavy duty sanding of hickory . it be very quiet . have enough power , if use 40 grit paper , that it pull so hard it wear out my employee . the tracking be top quality . the long power cord be a plus . I own over 2 dozen Makita tool and this will not disappoint .
Bag	POS	5	this tool bag  DEWALT D6050 17-Inch Ballistic Nylon Tool Bag  the factory supply storage box be find to be low quality when compare to the cost of this combo set . also , try to put all tool back into the storage container and be able to close it be next to impossible . all tool fit nicely in this tool bag , and , be very easily put back in and completely close when finish these tool .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be wonderful . I buy my husband new 16 foot cable and they fit very easily and neatly into this bag . keep it organize in the trunk and easy to find . highly recommend .
Bag	POS	5	this be a suberb case for the price . complete with a allweather cover for `` rought situation '' this case be ideal for a digital camera or a regular camera . I currently have a Nikon Coolpix 800 digital camera and it fit perfectly . the case be a great size because it be not to small where it can not hold anything and not to big where it be a nusiance to lag around . another good thing be the ability for the case to attatch to a belt . the soft inside of the case offer superb protection with the gentleness not to damage the camera 's lcd . it also have two laminated pocket which be perfect for hold extra memory card . the divider be great for create a perfectly size spot for you camera seperates\/and allow access to the extra space to store all the accessory for you camera . my personal favorite feature be that the case be zipper to prevent anyone from steal you camera . a beautifully craft camera case at a terrific price .
Bag	POS	5	I be a woodcarver and I use the Gatemouth to transport work in progress , along with my tool , on trip , etc. . it be roomy and also sturdy enough to protect the contents .
Bag	POS	5	when I first receive this case , the sheer size of the packaging throw I off - feel like it be another piece of check-in luggage ! however , have use it for a few week for my slr -lrb- Nikon D-80 -rrb- , the case actually do a perfect job of protect the camera , lens , and other accessory . any smaller and I think it would have be non-functional for my camera . the availability of pocket pretty much all over help store accessory . overall I really like this case and I know my camera and lens be secure in it .
Bag	POS	4	I use this mainly to carry tool and hardware between the house and -lrb- detach -rrb- garage . I can load it with a hammer drill , cordless drill\/driver , etc. . it have various inner and outer pocket and divider to carry hand tool and hardware . it appear well-made and heavy duty , good value .
Bag	POS	5	I think that this be a great bag for the price . I have a d90 , the kit zoom lens , a nikon55-300mm ed , a sb700 , and quite a few small accessory in this bag . it be a snug fit , but I do not have any trouble close the bag , and if I add much more stuff it would be too heavy to carry around all day any way . the strap be very comfortable , and I like the front flap system . I can fit battery , some other junk , and even a pocket camcorder . I be not really sure why some people would write critical review of this bag due to it be size . it be a small bag , and sell as such . if you need a bigger bag , just buy a bigger bag . would you write a critical review of a pair of size 9 shoe for be to small because you wear size 10 ?
Bag	POS	5	when you invest hundred of dollar on tool you want the best protection and convenience and this be exactly what I be look for in a bag for my MAX sn890rh nailer . as other have state , this bag stand up on its own due to the rigid bottom . make of heavy duty material , small pouch inside the bag for hold you oil , pocket on the outside for hold glove or whatever you need . I order mine from Lewis contractor supply and they price be a few cent cheaper than Amazon 's price and it be not the side-zip model that someone else have get . glad I buy it and worth every penny .
Bag	POS	4	after get my new Canon , I go to LowePro 's site to find the perfect bag , have use they product for we previous camera . they camera matrix make this a snap . three model be list as the best fit , and I could only find this one locally -lrb- which I need , to try it out -rrb- . the 30 be quite large for my camera , but enable I to load it bottom-down , rather than on-edge like several of the other I try . when unzipped , you can access all storage area , include two small pouch in front for spare memory card -lrb- they would easily hold 6 cf card -rrb- . the bag have a cushion , fleece interior , with a separate small pocket for spare aa . the main storage area also come with a removable cushion divider which attach with velcro , so you can subdivide the camera area as you wish . when I be try the camera on-edge I use it , but once I place the camera in bottom-first , I do not need it . for the s1 there be quite a bit of room on top . another add feature be the all-weather cover which be hide in the outside back of the case . pull out , it fit over the case like a rainhat , keep you camera and other item dry . Pretty cool . the shoulder strap be removable and well-designed , and the case also have a triple velcro belt-loop affair , if you would like to hang it closer . this case be probably too large for I to attempt that , but I like have the option . the 25 be another case which should fit my Canon s1 , but since I could not find it locally I buy this case , and be please with it . Ritz Camera : $ 29.99 Amazon : $ 20.84
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this cable bag in conjunction with Coleman Cable Systems 08660 20 ' heavy duty 4-gauge Jumper Cables -lrb- also sell by Amazon -rrb- . this bag swallow the 20 foot of four gauge cable and can easily accomodate a longer , heavier cable . the product dimension be 13 inch in diameter x 4 inch in depth . Bucket Boss make high quality product that will satisfy the most demand consumer . if you would like to protect you booster cable and reduce clutter , this product do a outstanding job .
Bag	NEG	1	I do multiple install in a day and any product that can save I time make I money . clean up be a requirement and I be hope this bag would at least help with contain the pile of sawdust that my bosch table create . it do not . in fact , the bag will catch about a 1\/3 or less and then because you have cover the exhaust hole , the sawdust will then blow back thru the blade opening into you face , even with the blade barely expose over you material . this blow back of course cause a dust cloud around the saw . its faster to clean up a large pile of sawdust on the ground from the exhaust hole than clean up a 5 ' area all around the saw from that dust cloud create by use the bag . it look nice and be big enough , but doesnt do the job at all .
Bag	NEU	3	Greg sorry to disagree but this case be too big -lrb- in height not in width -rrb- for a Canon Powershot a20 . I like the batterie holder though .  one other thing I hate about this case , be the belt thing ... you have to remove you belt to put this case or to remove it ... too bad ...
Bag	POS	5	a great bag with all the protection you would want for you gear . would be a little tight for two body and all the related gear . quality construction throughout . Amazon give great service again and the bag arrive in a timely manner . I would definitely buy this bag again .
Bag	NEU	3	I search the world over for a nice , inexpensive bag to bring to Japan , to be use as a carry-on for the plane , a purse , and a overnight bag , all in one trip . I have a couple of problem . First of all , the padding intend to keep a laptop out of harm way take up quite a bit of unnecessary space , when a laptop be not be use . secondly , as a purse , while easy to get into and out of -lrb- and water resistant , I might add ! -rrb- the strap be uncomfortable after be carry for more than a hour -- especially if there be anything of significant weight in the bag . but , on the whole , I be glad I buy the bag , and would do it again -- I would just put some padding on the strap before I leave ! -lrb- fit nicely in the overhead compartment of plane , train , bus , etc. -rrb-
Bag	POS	4	this be the second one of these handy bag that I have purchase . my son snag my first one and it be still go strong after eight or more relatively hard year skid back and forth across the bed of a pick-up -lrb- why he do not tie it down I will never understand !! -rrb- . I do notice that the material have change since my last purchase but this latest stuff be refer to as `` rip stop '' and it seem tough enough . my first bag have a few scuff mark but no rip what so ever . this be a very practical sort of thing to own in that everyone need a emergency kit in they vehicle . if you do not want various and sundry thing adrift and roll around in you trunk or underneath a seat in you car , this bag be for you . there be enough room in the bag for I to have in addition to 14 ' eight gauge jumper , a 25 ' tow strap 2 '' wide with two hook plus a handful of chemlite . there be a small pocket on the front of the bag that you can most probably find a use for . add a decent first aid kit and you 'll be better able to handle `` problem '' that may come you way . `` be prepare , '' winter be almost upon we .
Bag	POS	5	the Tamrac System 3 -lrb- and other `` System '' -rrb- bag be very well craft camera bag . the bag have several very attractive feature .  -- handle and strap be strong and very comfortable . -- access to bag be easy , zipper very smooth , clip easy to manage . -- Main body of bag can be reconfigure with velcro separator . -- surprisingly high capacity -lrb- I carry a slr body with standard lens , a 75-300 zoom , spare short focal length lens , hot shoe full flash and digital 6x zoom camera all in central pocket -rrb- -- several additional useful separator , film holder , documentation , place for lens cleaner , paper or cloth -rrb- -- durable outer shell that can take some abuse  all of this be contain in what appear from the outside to be a very small bag that easily store for travel . perhaps most importantly the separator , outer shell , and body construction real do appear to protect you equipment -lrb- yes I be ashamed to admit that I have have my fully load bag drop off of table and down step -rrb- . do not buy more bag than you need . if you have get a reasonable amount of gear this bag probably can handle it .
Bag	POS	5	this be a great all around bag for the average ameture photographer . lot of room for a body and up to a 300 mm lens .
Bag	POS	5	I love these bag . I have a great Pyrenees and along with that Great be the size of he poop . I can pick up he pile with one bag . I have large hand and they fit in the bag ok .

I send it back 3 month after purchase . after wait 10 week , it be ready for return , except they want $ 40 for the repair . it turn out the switch go bad , and it and several other item be not cover after 30 day . that be not mention anywhere when I purchase it . I will never buy another Bosch tool again . by the way , I be 58 and this be the first time I have ever have a switch go bad on a tool . I be not be not a commercial user .
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this dust collection bag when I purchase my Bosch 4100 tablesaw . this tablesaw go on almost every job with I and I like have the dust collection bag so that I be not sweep up as much sawdust at the end of the day .
Bag	POS	5	I love Bucket Boss product . this be just a unique and well design product ! I use mine to hold a 50 foot heavy gauge extension cord plus a 20 foot medium gauge with three outlet and a wrench to change the blade on my  Skil SHD77M 15 Amp 7-1\/4 - Inch Mag Worm Drive circular saw  it would easily fit a couple of smaller extension cord along with the one already store in it , or carpenter pencil , utility knife and speed square as a cut guide ! I love the feeling of have my sloppy extension cord neatly stow away in this bag . it also make carry they to the jobsite much easier and I do not have to worry about the cord tangle during storage or transportation . I love the extra pocket for tool storage , this really extend the usability of the product . you can have you extension cord , jumper cable and whatever tool be specific for you application together in one compact unit ! I think this be a excellent solution and the bag be construct as to live up to the Bucketboss reputation for durability ! now I just need to get one for each of the car !
Bag	POS	5	this be a excellent sander . I really work this machine and it just keep on go . Brace you foot , hang on tight and keep on move ; this be a powerful sander . I usually sand with three grits and when change belt it be rarely necessary to touch the tracking adjustment . the 4 inch footprint be more resistant to tip than my 3 inch sander and ergonomics be perfect for I . con : there be 2 flat spot on the metal front roller 180 degree apart which cause a barely discernible bump but it be not really a problem . it just sometimes make it hard to tell if a belt be about to separate or not . recommend .
Bag	POS	5	I use the Makita 9903 to sand down 2 loft bed that I build and it work just fine . very easy to use freehand or clamp down to be use as table sander . change the belt sandpaper be a snap . adjust the belt tracker be easy and once set , it stay without drift off . variable speed be simple to use and effective . the release on the saw dust collection bag be not a zipper but a slide device which work nicely .
Bag	POS	5	this be the second bag I have own , and it be great . I look at a lot of bag and this be easily the best one . I have a 35mm camera , three lens , flash , lens doubler , and other accessory . I be able to fit everything in it with some room to spare . the bag be durable , light weight , and the construction be top notch . there be plenty of protection for you gear - lot of foam and the bottom be hard under the foam to protect against penetration from underneath . get to you gear be easy with the single front clip , yet you can make also make it more secure with the zipper . all zipper be cover for protection from dirt . even fully load the bag be easy to carry with either the handle or shoulder strap . I be very pleased with this bag and definitely recommend it .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be simply one of the most marvellous ! Easy and very usefull to take with you anything you want .
Bag	POS	4	we love this to keep we jumper in and easy to find , and store in the truck .
Bag	NEG	1	I have hardly use this little puppy . I nick the belt very slightly sand a piece of aluminum , replace the belt and it will not track properly or adjust now . I 'll update this when I have call Bosch , but I have have other problem recently with a 1375a grinder , and Bosch be not very helpful . overall this should be a great sander accord to design and spec , but it seem so delicate as to be entirely unsuitable for anything other than a ornament . for now , I be not buy another Bosch tool and I be create lot of colorful language when I think about the company . Make sure you read the poor review about Bosch before you commit you hard earn dollar to this company , I do not think they be a very honest company with much integrity at this point .
Bag	POS	5	still go strong after 6 year . have take a beating , but still in good shape . Bosch be quality .
Bag	POS	5	good Quality , good price . the tool bag be very spacious and well build .
Bag	POS	5	almost buy the variable speed but less powerful cousin . glad I do not . this unit work great . it be heavy so you will not want to do much vertical or overhead work . one reviewr comment that it wear out he worker and I can see why . a hour be the must I can go without a break . but you can get a lot of sand do in a hr with this tool . much quieter than my old Sears unit . dust collector work surprisingly well -lrb- but I wish they offer a vac attachment becasue at the rate this unit remove material you will have to empty bag every 10 min or sooner . probably 3 time faster than my 3 '' Sears and more stable with 4 '' footprint . my past tool have be Bosch , Milwaukee , and Dewalt . but I buy Makita 's top of line 18v saw and drill and be very impressed . buy this base on that experience and great review . very satisfy .
Bag	POS	5	I be refinish the woodwork in my home . I order this to save time in sand the jam , casing and baseboard . this sander work like a charm . I be very glad I purchase it .
Bag	POS	4	Perfect size for 20 ' 4ga . cable . keep they coil and compact for storage behind seat or in trunk .
Bag	POS	5	finally find a bag that will fit my 20 ft water hose , along with a 30 foot flat hose for my rv , as well as a 3ft hose . no kid it all fit . it will also hold various tool in a divide compartment that I need when I hook up to a water source . I be also order another to hold my 50 amp rv electrical cable . it will hold that along with a 30 to a 15 amp adapter and a 20 ft. length of 15 amp extension cord . all of the hose and electrical cord need to be neatly roll up , of course , but I be already do that anyway .
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this bag to accompany my Sony Digital 8 trv-103 . it fit great - not too tight , just enough room inside for a tape or two if need . the side pouch be a little tight , but have enough room for the remote control , two tape and a spare battery , plus a av cable . my only critique be that the bag do not have enough space for the ac adapter . while it fit in the main compartment with the camera , it be a pain to juggle it around when removing\/replacing the camera . nice leather-esque outside and rig bottom . a good bet for a small camcorder .
Bag	POS	5	very well design and manufacture machine . balance be near perfect , and use with one hand be comfortable and always in control . compare to a similar design sander , make by AEG , this sander be much more comfortable and better balanced . if you be a serious woodworker , this belt sander will spoil you . once you use this sander , you will not want to use a sander with a different design again .
Bag	POS	5	I have now purchase 2 box of these bag . they do not rip and be very sturdy . I have a large dog and these bag work great .
Bag	POS	4	the dust bag on my sander be not the same as the one depict in the image on the site . the one that come in the box be cheesier in design , and lack the bracket\/strut show . also , the suggest accessory be limit to sandpaper roll . no dust collection attachment , no upgrade for the bag . the sander itself be powerful , easy to use , and do the job I want it to do .
Bag	POS	5	I own the Kodak dc3400 digital camera , and can not say enough about this case . it have room for my battery charger , extra set of battery , all pc cable , Kodak 's software cd , and the manual that come with my camera .  if you digital camera be similar in size to Kodak 's dc3400 , get this bag . it be simply the best balance , between compact size - and have enough room for all you accessory .
Bag	NEG	1	ok , I find out that this do not fit my detector -lrb- ace 250 -rrb- , which I would have know if I have read the other review . that would not have matter if ... the thing be well make . I assume that since it be make by Garrett that it would be well make , but the zipper stick on first go and then break 5 minute after get it out of the package . that say , I be return it and will not bother replace it . this be one accessory that you could probably save money by not get in the first place . I be surprised Garrett would let they name be on this thing it be such poor quality . point to Garrett for at least be responsive about the quality issue of this bag , but they should definitely redesign it so it fit they detector and do not break . after all , it do have the Garrett name on it !
Bag	POS	5	purchase this for my son to keep in he truck under the seat . it arrive quickly and look just like the picture . very happy !
Bag	POS	5	we have several of the Bucket Boss bag and they be all very handy ! if you want to store a tow strap and\/or jumper cable , flashlight , glove , small tool , reflectors\/flares , etc. then the Cable and Tool bag be perfect . it have room for more stuff than the Bucket Boss Jumper Cable and Extension cord bag . we have that one too and it be more basic , but still really nice for jumper cable and glove . any of the Bucket Boss bag we have get have be very sturdy and have hold up well despite slide around in we vehicle , be toss in the garage , and stuff under car seat .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for my husband as a Christmas present . after he would use it for over a month , I ask he what he think of it . he love be able to throw everything into one bag -lrb- he be a carpenter -rrb- . it be durable , roomy , plenty of pocket . the one drawback , he say , be that if he fill it with as much stuff as it would hold , it be too heavy to carry around the job site ! -lrb- e.g. , when he be do commercial work , there be a ton of walk compare to when he be do residential . -rrb- so that be about the one thing that could improve this bag - put it on wheel with a telescoping handle -lrb- like a suitcase -rrb- . : - -rrb-
Bag	NEU	3	the bag itself be great . the problem be that it be feature as be compatable with the JVC GRAXM225U Camcorder . well ... it be not ! it be too small . there be not enough room to hold the camera , the charger , the VHS cartridge , rca cable and a spare tape . it would be great for those who only want it to hold the camera and the VHS tape cartridge . but then where be you go to keep the rest of you `` stuff '' !
Bag	POS	5	I own a Kodak DC215 Zoom Digital Camera . it fit very nicely into the Kodak essential Camera Bag . I buy the bag online , and when I receive it , it be bigger than I expect . the small compartment for extra memory card be very handy , but the strap for hold battery be pretty tight , so fasten the battery be kind of a problem . however , this keep the battery from fall out . there be a small flap inside to separate the camera from cable or other element that you might want to place inside . tightly squeeze , I be able to fit in my camera , a Kodak Battery Charger , and a SanDisk usb card Reader . all in all , this Camera Bag be very roomy , nicely build , and with enough space to fit what you need to carry around , if you own a small camera , like the dc215 .
Bag	POS	4	the product be exactly as discribed , but i realize my hop vac fit there too -lrb- nice job Bosch -rrb- . so I have never use the bag . if you do not have a standard shop vac , well worth the money to help keep thing clean .
Bag	NEU	3	the bag be well make and fit my k-x with 18-55mm zoom nicely . inside top flap pocket for extra battery and sd card be nice to have . only problem -- the strap be too short to wear over the opposite shoulder . I be not huge , but when I put the strap over my opposite shoulder the bag come up to my rib . the strap need to be at least 10 '' longer to sit at waist\/hip level . hang the strap over the same shoulder be not nearly as secure . this strap use ` male ' side release connector on each end , most camera bag use clip-type fitting so I have not be able to find a replacement strap .
Bag	POS	5	Works great and construct well . my jumper cable coil up inside nicely and be no longer a tangled mess on the floor of my truck . it fit behind the seat next to my Bucket Boss Tool Roll -lrb- another problem solver -rrb- where I keep my tool set .
Bag	POS	5	I get tire of deal with my old skill 18 '' sander . I could never keep more than half the belt on its track . the bottom plate would also collapse on one side after awhile necessitate a screw driver pry job . with the right belt the Makita be a well behave mini-beast -lrb- loose the belt that come with the Makita and get yourself some of the premium Norton belt ... you 'll be glad you do -rrb- . as other 's have say , this thing track flawlessley after a couple of adjust turn on the side-dial . the belt stay on track even after change through various belt . the bottom plate assembly look durable . it have plenty of power and it suck up saw dust to the bag like a vacuum . I would venture to say it capture about 90 % of the saw dust . the long cord be great because it keep you knot-tie connection to you extention cord away from you project where it typically get hang up on corner . this thing be make I look for project I would not have even consider with my old sander .
Bag	POS	5	I would see these at the local dog park and have be look for they locally for some time . all I could find around town be those really thin bag that just do not quite get the job do . I be happy to find these available at Amazon where the price be good and shipping be free and fast . these bag be way better than most other in term of pick up you dog 's business and in odor control . they be a lot thicker and much easier to tie up . a quality product that be a must for dog owner .
Bag	POS	5	I have purchase this bag for all my child , niece and nephew to go with they jumper cable . they be very rugged and durable .
Bag	POS	4	this be a pretty decent product . more room than I expect , but the shoulder strap really need to go . there be absolutely nothing special about it . it could use some sort of padding on it too . the bag fit my Canon EOS ix Lite 2 lens , a flash , the owner 's manual , 5 roll of film , and I have still get room .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this camera bag for a larger digital camera . while there be plenty of room for my camera and all of its accessory , the bag be not overly large or awkward . the bag be sturdy and its compartment be laid-out logically .
Bag	NEG	2	purchase the Garrett Metal Detector bag a few day ago . very disappoint with the bag . my Garrett ace 250 metal detector be 44 '' long on the shortest lenght . the bag be only 42 '' long . the metal detector be too long for the bag . guess it would fit if I be to take it apart but ... that seem silly & useless . would not have purchase the bag if I would have know it would not fit unless I take the metal detector apart . what a rip off ! Update ... I would like to say that the company stand behind it be product . they email a response on my review and be very concerned that I be disappoint with the bag . the company make thing right and in this day and time that very seldom happen . most of the time it be all about sell the product . but not this company . it be important to they that the customer be satisfy . I must say , I be satisfied now .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this last week and get it a few day ago . this be a great digital camera bag . I do extensive research before commit and I must say it pay off . the bag have a nice divider which I use to seperate my cable from my camera . it also be line with a soft fabric so you lcd screen be not scratch . I must say that if you stuff the main compartman , the front compartment be basially render useless . the front area have two laminated compartment for smartmedium or compactflash card . they be basically the only two thing that will fit since the camera in the main compartment make it a very tight fit .
Bag	POS	4	receive this bag to go along with my Olympus c-4000 . it be quite a nice bag , relatively compact and easily fit my c-4000 with plenty of protection offereed by the wall of the case and padded divider . there be plenty of room leave for cable , a flash or even another camera if you have get one . a mesh pouch on the inside of the main compartment flap offer a handy place to store my sm card . on the other side , another component offer 4 elastic loop for battery , and 2 mesh pouch -lrb- 1 zippered -rrb- for store more battery or whatever else you might have . I can easily store 3 set of 4 aa battery in here , with plenty of room for more sm card . and to top it all off , a zippered side pouch for another place to put stuff -lrb- nothing too thick though -rrb- . there be a adjustable carry strap that you can use to sling over you shoulder , plus handle on the top and side , so there be plenty of way to grab onto the bag . the only think I do not like about this bag be that mine do not seem to want to stand up . it always end up roll over onto its back . this however be a pretty minor thing .
Bag	POS	5	I be a Aircraft Line Mechanic and have be for 15 year . this little bag be a replacement for the first . they last year and be of much higher quality of anything you 'll find at Sears , Home Depot , etc. . plus the price aint bad .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this case to carry my Olympus 2020 . the newer Olympus 3030 and 3000 should fit nicely too . I debate buy a smaller bag which would fit the camera only , but the extra room have come in handy . I have a compact pair of binoculars and these fit snugly along with the camera in the main compartment .  in the zip down front I store the manual , the remote , a extra memory card and a cable to connect to a tv . at family event it be great to see the picture on tv right away .  the case be well make , but it be not genuine leather , although it be hard to tell the difference . you can put you belt through the slot on the back , but it be somewhat bulky to carry this way . I prefer to use the shoulder strap . all in all a excellent product .  edit on 11\/10\/02 : Case Logic have change the design of this bag without change the model number . I own the older horizontal version , not the bag picture which have more of a vertical shape . Case Logic should have use a new model number when they update the bag .
Bag	POS	5	this be a extremely well-designed and well-built sander . no complaint here only praise , praise , praise !  thank you Bosch -- you sure make my life a lot better !!
Bag	NEG	2	this only hold the camera + lens and a few roll of film . no room for a extra lens , no room for a flash , no room for a extra body . get something else .
Bag	POS	5	I like this style of sander for many reason . to early to tell if I be real happy . track seem to be a issue out of the box . I 'll follow up after I figure it out .
Bag	POS	5	this morning I receive the messenger bag and it do really come up with most of my expectation . I could not help myself to get on this web site and review this product right now , after make some test of course : - -rrb- First of all , about the soutside : the design be really great , clear and elegant , the Amazon.com logo discreet -lrb- it doesnt make you a living advertisement sign for the company -rrb- . the bag be roomy and there be place for plenty of stuff , e.g. several book , magazine , personal item ... the material be of good quality and you wont have to worry about you stuff in the rain ... I would have wish though that the material be a bit thicker and sturdier , similar to the messenger bag of the Freitag brother ... the different pocket inside -lrb- especially the one for my Palm V or any other pda -rrb- help you to get organize a bit easier . the clip with the key ring be a nice add-on , but you do not have to push very hard to get the key away , so I be not sure if it will be that safe , a little pressure and they be go ... I do like the protected compartment for the notebook . it be in a safe place , away from the other item you might carry . a quite good feature be also the little pocket with zipper on the back flap , allow you to stow the magazine you just buy in the bag without have to open the front flap ... this be very handy if you be too late and have to run to catch the train or bus : - -rrb- the mobile phone pocket be neat , but slightly too small for my Noka 7110 . I can squeeze it in , but can not really close the flap . another quite nice add-on be the mesh pocket on the outside for a can of a beverage or a small snack . it doesnt get in touch with you document and other item . this be very handy in case you crash once with you bike : - -rrb- the foam padded shoulder strap be great ... if the bag be heavy , it be still confortable to carry and it holdp perfectly well on you shoulder . other small thing to mention , especially for biker , be the removable reflective tape a the webbing loop to attach a lead in the night . this bag be so far the best bag a biker can wish for .
Bag	NEG	2	look like a good product , but be clearly use and the belt be worn so I return it . Amazon will not let you exchange this product , so I order another . if it be use as well , I 'll be dissapoint . so far I have order 3 powertool on Amazon and all have be clearly use , and some missing part . I be give they one last shot . beware .
