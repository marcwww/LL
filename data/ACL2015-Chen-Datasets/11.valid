AlarmClock	POS	5	I have look everywhere -lrb- include Wal-Mart -rrb- and could not find just a simple travel clock anywhere . this be just what I want - nothing fancy but it do the job I need it to do .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	cute clock and cute idea but the vibration be not as strong as I have imagine .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my wife have cataract , but with the large letter she can see the time from all across the room , and so far it have keep time perfectly
AlarmClock	POS	5	so my grandparent have be waken up at like 10 yo so I buy this for they and know they wake up at 9:59 and 59 seconds ok so that be my history report even though I only get u z ------ ok that be my review
AlarmClock	POS	5	the clock be purchase for my grandson who be autistic and love clock . the purchase be timely and in good shape as advertise . thanks .
AlarmClock	POS	5	after purchase a ugly Sonic bomb alarm for myself and have great result -lrb- finally ! -rrb- get up for work on time , my 16-year-old daughter-also a very heavy sleeper-requested one . further search turn up the same alarm in way better clothing . now we both be jolt from sound sleep , out of bed , and be leave the house on time . if you want to get to class on time or keep you job , I highly recommend both of these alarm . they do not have multiple you-tube video for nothing !
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the concept be great , the build in lamp be terrible - about as bright as a night light , do not know how that be suppose to wake I up . also , if it go out it be not cheap to replace . to get any use out of the Sunrise\/Set feature you have to have it control a external lamp with a external power adapter almost the size of the clock itself . the clock itself feel like a toy , light plastic and cheap construction with flimsy button that work for a few month and require small finger -lrb- I have those and still have to use my nail -rrb- . I would recommend that you spend the money on a clock of this type with a build in external lamp control , most of those even come with sleep sound . can not beat that . but really , really , do not buy this alarm clock . perhaps  Sunrise Sun Simulator Day Light SRS150 Alarm clock  or even  Apollo Health DayBreak Duo Dawn\/Dusk Simulator
AlarmClock	NEG	1	do not expect this to last more than 1 year . the digital display be so bright that it hurt to look at it if you wake up and want to see the time . but the bottom line , it do not work after about 9 month . I only give it 1 star because I have to .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this little clock only measure 2 '' x 2 '' but it be simplicity make up for the tiny size . the off\/off button be simple to operate -lrb- up for `` on , '' and down for `` off '' -rrb- , the time and alarm be easy to set , and the clock make no noticeable tick sound . the alarm be reasonably loud . I would have like something larger and a bit more robust -lrb- I fumble in the morning -rrb- and be amaze at how difficult it be to find a simple battery operate alarm clock that do nothing but keep the time and wake you up .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have use this clock for a few month now . its great . its the little thing like the ease of set the nap timer or use the snooze . some guy say this clock gain time . that a little true after 5 month it gain 3 minute . not a problem .
AlarmClock	POS	5	the Westclox Travelmate be multi-useful . use when travel , at work , or at home . the ideal `` backup '' when weather-related problem develop . keep one in you car -lrb- and boat , etc -rrb- . if you be downsize or just want thing small but effective , this be the clock for you . Easy to use button , clear dial and amazing battery life . my original one be over 10 year old and never have battery replace . it be actually kinda weird ... in a good way . these will be some stock stuffer this year .
AlarmClock	POS	4	these be nice and funky . we buy one use from somebody who put athletic tape over the speaker -lrb- on the back -rrb- to muffle the bird noise -- a good idea , it be plenty loud enough on `` low '' and with the tape . if you be a deep sleeper , I be sure the unmuffled `` high '' setting will open you eye .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love the look of this clock and it keep perfect time . it sit on my computer desk and I can see that big ol light up dial from across the room . I have never use the alarm function so I can not comment on that ...
AlarmClock	POS	4	the display could be a little brighter and more prominent , but even so , it be fine . other than that , it be a all around great alarm clock . the sound be pretty good too .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I be really bum that this one do not work out . I be look for a white noise machine and I only use the `` rain '' and `` white noise '' sound and they loop be WAY too short . I be a bit neurotic and obsessive about little thing and be sensitive to pattern . the `` rain '' setting be about a 10 second loop and I could pick out a faint ` tap tap tap ' and I , of course , focus on that , every 10 seconds . then I go to the `` white noise '' set which have a even fainter problem noise , on a even shorter loop , about 5 seconds . I also feel that even the lowest noise setting be not quite low enough -lrb- I have the clock close to by head -rrb- . and the light emit by the clock be really bright , even when turn on low . maybe this will be better in my son 's room ...
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock replace we last alarm which fall victim to a overly angry press of the snooze button . my wife have be use it for a week now with no complaint . the initial setup be incredibly easy . after hold setup , you use the dial to input you setting . a fast turn of the dial increase the time in 10 or 30 minute increment ; a slow one nudge the minute along . I never realize how handy it be to have a 7-day alarm schedule - especially where I like to sleep in on weekend and have to be up early on monday . it be worth note , however , that if on a certain Wednesday you take a day off -lrb- and change the wake-up time -rrb- you would have a entire week to forget that you would do so . finally , it would useful if the manufacturer would better secure the holder for the -lrb- backup -rrb- battery . still , I be as enthusiastic as one could be about a alarm clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	so far everything be as describe in the product description . will come back and write more if anything turn out negative .
AlarmClock	POS	5	it arrive quickly and be just what I want . I be very happy with my purchase .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this clock because I want a `` set-and-forget '' clock that also have a thermometer . my major complaint about this clock be that in the two week that I have own it , it be never be able to sync with the atomic clock ! it keep try every night and never succeed . since return it be not worth the hassle , I decide to open it up and look inside . -lrb- I be a engineer , with some knowledge of how these circuit work -rrb- I be surprise to find that the the circuit inside look extremely cheap . there be a dry solder where the battery wire connect to the circuit board . the antenna -lrb- for the radio -rrb- have its wire short . everything look very sloppy in general . I then manage to separate the short on the antenna , hope that it would make the radio work . no luck . the radio sync still do not work . which be hardly surprising consider that the antenna itself be not cleanly wind ! it be unevenly wound by hand ! not machine wound . do I mention that the build quality be horrible ? I do not know if the clock 's circuitry have support for manage daylight savings or I have to reset it twice a year . I 'll find out in about 4 month I guess . but for the price , I guess it be a decent enough clock . it serve my purpose : maintain time fairly accurately and have a thermometer . I would really like to have the clock sync with the atomic clock via the radio though . Edit -lrb- 17-jan-2010 -rrb- : okay , so the radio feature finally work out , but it be still kind of flaky , work sometimes , do not sometimes . I be willing to now give this product the benefit of the doubt : maybe it be my location or something about the construction of my apartment that be the problem . I have revise the rating to 4 star now . would give it five star if only I have not open up the clock and see the shoddy construction .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I think this be a fantastic alarm clock . although it could have be the gental alarm could be a tad louder . the number be large enough to see . otherwise there be nothing wrong with it .  i like the tradtional alarm clock styal . I be more impressed with the quality of this clock better then it be t112 counter part . I would love to see more of these make then the other one witch I could do without .  i like havee three option of bell & not two . this electronic be pretty to look at also .
AlarmClock	POS	5	initially i be hesitant to purchase this clock , becuase the review be so negative . but i go out on a limb and buy it anyway . the clock be EXACTLY what i want . I be a college student and the escalate alarm work perfectly so it be quiet enough to wake I up -lrb- I be a light sleeper -rrb- but not to loud to wake my roommate up . I absolutely love that it be analog , i much prefer it to digital . and i know some people where say it be smaller than they expect and i can say that be true , but it be still a lovely and function clock , not super large or anything . the only thing for I be that the picture of the clock be only different in one way really , the font . the font on the clock in the picture be different from the font on the actual clock -lrb- the number be write in a more normal text -rrb- . someone also say it be very wobbly , but that be not true it be very stable for I . I mean as long as you be not slam you entire arm on the thing to turn the alarm off , you should be fine . and it be a very soft tick clock , so its perfect for a light sleeper such as myself . actually the light ticking be kind of soothing ...
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock be so cheap and very useful and reliable . the back light be really helpful at night . the thermometer come it handy to temperature control .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	it would be one thing if the button be big enough for even petite finger or if the light be really very bright to notice or even if the clock keep proper time - but it do not ! I receive this item as a gift and be shock the sticker price . I have have the clock a few year now and have be itch to get rid of it . I have to continually reset the time - every 6 week I find it be get ten minute faster so I either set my alarm ahead or range back through the number to set the time correctly or to correct it the next month again . the radio be cheap and difficult to tune . I need a sunrise clock but at this point I be think of get a `` vacation '' timer for my bedside lamp and just set that instead . what a bother .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I really enjoy use this product , and it be a great addition to my Star Wars collection . I do wish it have more feature -lrb- date , timer , etc. -rrb- , but if you be a Star Wars fanatic like I , that should not be a problem . I really be please with this purchase , and seriously recommend it ! I do hope they come out with more product just like this one .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be really glad I order this clock . the light flash several minute before the alarm go off . I usually wake up to that . there be many different option on the alarm . it be face be always light up so you can see the time if you awake during the night , but not too bright to light up the room . I be very picky with clock and I absolutley love this clock .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I be happy that this product be just as I think it would look and the size I want , but it gain 2 hour of time overnight . the return process so far have be very easy and efficient . this process be not complete as I just discover the problem and initiate the return . this be a Christmas gift .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this thing . I keep it set on hourly chirping . I spend half the year in Seattle with only crow and seagull . this clock remind I so much of home in the Carolinas with the chirping of various bird and it be fun to guess . I put it on the deck with the raptor card hope to scare away unwanted critter . . that have only frightened the cat , however .
AlarmClock	POS	5	simple and to the point ALARM CLOCK . after return a too complicated alarm clock `` gadget '' from Oregon Scientific , this clock be what I be look for . it work like a charm this morning -lrb- 3\/11\/07 -rrb- change to DST . get it , plug it in and forget it ! and for a unbeatable price to boot ! Wish it have the weekday\/weekend alarm option , but still a great ALARM clock .
AlarmClock	POS	4	as other reviewer have mention , this seem to be the only clock of its kind out there . it be the most sensible clock I have ever own . I have it set for a earlier time twice a week on the day that I run , and for a later time on weekend day . I do not hear a pop when the radio come on , so it be so slight I do not even notice it . the shortcoming be slight but I will mention they . to set the alarm you use the big knob on the top , and it make a fairly loud crank noise which can be kind of annoy to you sleep spouse . the other thing be that the little display that tell you if the alarm be on or not be very tiny - it would be nice if it be bigger . overall though this be a great alarm clock and I recommend it for anyone who do not get up at the same time every day .
AlarmClock	POS	4	there be few analog plug-in clock available these day , so I be delighted to find this one . not only do it function well , but I love the design . the pre-alarm tone light flash be cool , though it rarely wake I if I be in deep sleep .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	the Sharper image sound Soother have a very sleek and modern design , however , there be a few flaw that detract from the overall experience . first , the digital display be very bright in a dark bedroom . unlike a regular , cheap alarm clock where only the time be light , the entire display of the sound soother be backlit . if you bedroom have little ambient light at night , this display will emit a glow that some people may find too bright . although there be three display brightness setting , there be little difference between they and the lowest setting be still bright . we have to turn the clock away from the bed at night so it be not directly in we face , but the glow be still significant . second , the sound quality could be better . this could be a tradeoff for the sleek design , but the sound be not very natural come out of the small rear speaker and be a bit tinny as another reviewer have note . the volume control be not very good either , as the difference between the first , second , third , etc. volume selection be very noticeable . in other word , 1 be too soft for some sound , but 2 be way too loud . the audio loop on some of the sound be too short as well , and if you be concentrate on the sound you may be able to detect the pattern , which can be distract as you be try to fall asleep . also , the control button themselves make a very loud and abrasive `` click '' sound when you push they , which seem odd for a machine design to relax you . overall , the Sound Soother be a decent alarm clock that get the job do , but it could definitely be improve -lrb- display too bright , audio quality be lack , and button take away from the overall experience -rrb- . although it be make by Sharper image , it have a somewhat `` cheap '' feeling to it . despite the flaw , it be one of the better sound machine\/alarm clock I come across that be less than $ 50 .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my 17 year old daughter be invite to attend she last two year of high school away from home . she be incredibly smart and we just could not pass up the opportunity for she . the only problem be , be away from home and have nobody to make she get up , she be constantly oversleep ! we shop for all sort of alarm clock for she , always buy the one that be advertise as be the loudest . after she second detention for miss class and\/or be tardy I decide I have to find something that actually would wake she up . well , I find it . she have now have this alarm clock for a little over a month and have not oversleep once !! she say the first couple of day it scare she half to death , but this be not one of those alarm that just buzz and she never hear . she put the part that vibrate under she pillow because put it under the mattress be not a option with the way the dorm bed be construct . I highly recommend this product to anyone who have a child like mine who do not hear traditional alarm clock !! one less worry for I as a mother have a child live away from home .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	useless . the off switch do not work , so clock would go off every 12 hour with no way to shut it up . throw it away after fuss with it for three day .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I like the : 1 -rrb- Easy to read display 2 -rrb- Alarm Reset - single button turn off alarm and reset it for next day and it be easy to find 3 -rrb- Easy to use 4 -rrb- display PM & Alarm on 5 -rrb- single buttom to list to NOAA Weather 6 -rrb- look good , but if you be up very close have a bit of a paint on finish appearence - the finish could be better . 7 -rrb- single alarm - most radio alarm clock have two alarm , but as I never use that feature and it cause confusion on what I be set more than once , I very much like that there be only one alarm . 8 -rrb- pick up AM , FM , and Weather great - I be in a city . 9 -rrb- Great Price - I prefer this radio to my almost new ... radio that it be replace !
AlarmClock	NEG	2	where to start . no warranty , no instruction . would not set time automatically . focus knob simply rotate ; do not focus . without instruction be difficult to set up . Worth maybe $ 10 for the projection , no more . overall , cheap , cheap , cheap . Poor example for Lacrosse ; will avoid they from now on . very disappointed ,
AlarmClock	POS	4	this be a great little alarm clock . we be no longer at the mercy of the unreliable hotel wake-up call . however , the face of the clock be dark and therefore illegible in the middle of the night .
AlarmClock	POS	5	i be a heavy sleeper and work 2 job so every alarm clock i have buy i couldnt hear ... they either chirp or the alarm be very soft and i couldnt hear they to wake for work . so i be always try not to sleep to heavily when i do get to sleep which eventually start make I pretty miserable from lack of sleep ... until i find this alarm clock the sonic boom now i can fall asleep and this clock wake I right up its loud and the vibrate help alot as well . very good product !!!!! very good investment !!!!!
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this because I want a small , maintenance-free alarm clock . it be not as small as I would like -lrb- it be about the size of two VHS tape -rrb- . it claim to be solar power but it come with a cr123a lithium `` back-up '' battery . the manual read , `` this battery should provide a back up power supply to you clock for up to 8 year or even longer . '' I have not have it long so I can not verify that claim . it do set the time automatically , which be cool .
AlarmClock	POS	4	other review be correct as to the instruction leave something to be desire . I spend 45 minute try to figure out how to set the alarm . in the end , just keep try and you will stumble across the correct combo of button to press and when . I enjoy be awaken by chime vs my old alarm clock with a nasty loud buzzer that would make you jump five foot in the air when it go off . other reviewer where correct in say the alarm sound i.e. chime , rainfall etc. be even to loud in the lowest setting . I be go to experiment slightly cover the speaker with duct tape till I get it to the lower volume I want . this clock be not perfect , but the next best -lcb- for chime -rcb- be twice as expensive as this one . otherwise there be no other clock that come close to this one and trust I , I spend countless hour search the internet for just the right clock . this be as close as you be go to get with a clock that offer many different sound to wake to , have two separate alarm . one for you & one for you wife . the clock have a nice look to it . to those who complain about the sound quality etc. . you get what you pay for , go spend hundred of dollar and get a ipod with a separate sound system .
AlarmClock	POS	4	too bad there be no option to keep it on !!! the time only display for a few seconds after you clap\/make noise and then it be off . you might be applaud a lot if you be often interested in the time . otherwise , I love the way it look and its size be perfect for my desk space .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the clock flash a frightening red color when it go off in the morning-first surprise . then the battery die , so I replace they , but after two day the backlight stop work , the number fade to the point where I could barely see they , and the volume become so low I could barely hear it .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I do not understand all the rave review about this useless alarm clock . Mine , when set up , buzz for less than a minute , in such a low tone that you can happily sleep through the entire time and wake up two hour later without even notice . additionally , it would be suppose , when you do not hear the alarm the first time , to buzz again at 4 minute interval : it do not . in simpler word : it only sound for less than a minute at the set time , it have a very low tone , and stop dead there , until the day after . no appeal , no redemption . you be go to be late for work if you rely on this awful clock . it be a waste of time , money and hope . I purchase it because it bear the name of `` Elgin '' , a very good watchmaker . but I go back to my `` make in China '' $ 6 alarm clock , that be reliable , humble and do not require fuss about .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	pay 20.99 for the clock . it work as promise first six month . BUT it stop work in 6 month , go dark and nothing can be do to turn the light back on . it seem like if I return it I have to pay for ship both way . not sure why if the product be defective i have to pay for shipping .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I like a travel alarm you can see in the dark , and the Snooze button accomplish this when you wake up in the middle of the night , yet turn off to let you sleep in the dark . it be a nice small size and compact to carry .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this alarm clock be the perfect backup travel alarm clock . it be the smallest , lightest alarm clock possible that even have a few extra feature to boot . \* it be small 2.6 '' W x 1.8 '' h x 0.6 '' d and weigh a scant 2oz with battery . \* it take 2 lr44 watch battery -lrb- easy to find -rrb- that have a lifespan of over 1.5 year and be lighter than the newer version -lrb- Casio PQ-13 and Casio PQ-15 -rrb- that take aaa and aa battery . \* Extra feature on this tiny clock be : 1 -rrb- 12 & 24 hr setting 2 -rrb- snooze feature -lrb- only 5-mins though -rrb- 3 -rrb- lead backlight -lrb- old green type -rrb- 4 -rrb- 3 separate function button that adjust with a audible click : time -lrb- alarm\/clock\/display -rrb- , display -lrb- 12 or 24 hour -rrb- , and alarm -lrb- on\/off\/snooze -rrb- so that there be not any mistake . as a result of its compact size , the function button be tiny . however , after a few use one can easily remember which button be which . in addition , as this be digital , there be no annoying tick . my main complaint be that the snooze\/light button -lrb- the blue one be the picture -rrb- be not protect when the stand\/cover be close . as such , the button could get accidentally press during transport . however , this issue have not be address in subsequent version . highly recommend as a backup travel alarm for those of we with smart phone . if the small label and tiny button be not a issue , this would also work well as a primary alarm clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	live in the country , we lose power a lot , so ac-powered alarm clock simply be not a option for I . I have use a Variety of 100 % battery operate alarm clock in the past , and this might be my favorite so far . its simple : a analog clock face that light up nicely -lrb- but not too brightly -rrb- when the button on the top be press . the alarm be easy to set , easy to turn on and off , and hard to sleep through . the tone be almost pleasant -lrb- at first -rrb- wake you up without a shock ... but it get steadily louder and faster so it be almost impossible to sleep through . I have not use it long enough to rate battery life , but power by 1 c battery it should last for a quite a while -lrb- my old clock run on two AAA 's and last almost a year - let 's face it , alarm clock be not exactly demand -rrb- . my only concern be that the unit be plastic . my cat like to hockey-puck thing off of my bedside table -lrb- especially if he want he breakfast , i.e. , almost every morning -rrb- . that be why my old clock be a metal clock -- the kind with the real bell inside . however , it be survive be knock to the ground several time so far with no visible damage , so despite a somewhat flimsy feel this clock be pretty sturdy .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	like some of the other reviewer , I too notice a very short sound loop . on most of the option it be annoying and not relaxing . but a few of the sound like the surf one , you can not notice it as much . also , there be complaint about the brightness of the lcd . I do not find that too bad . it be like have a soft blue nightlight . all in all , it be pretty good . the two alarm option be nice , the sound of a few of the track be decent , and it totally mask all the noise around I . so , I would recommend it if you can fine one sound track that be to you liking .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this clock be compact and easy to read and use . I wish that the on-off switch be more readable in the dark .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I be glad I find this little clock on Amazon , because it seem to be exactly what I be look for . Elgin be a reputable name in timepiece . unfortunately , the clock gain about 15 minute every five hour ! I test it more than once . I be so disappointed . have to return it . still look for something like it . I need something simple , folding , battery-operated , a clock that can keep accurate time -lrb- ! -rrb- and with a light that come on when press . unfortunately , it be not to be with this one . I do not usually write review , but feel obligate to report my recent experience with this model .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I really like this clock because it be easy to use , it do the job for which I buy it , and I like the sound of the alarm .
AlarmClock	POS	5	a good sturdy reliable travel clock for little money . Easy operation and compact . alarm be loud enough to wake you . I use it every day besides travel .
AlarmClock	POS	4	visually , this dalek alarm clock look very much like a real Dalek . the sound effect be excellant , and make I giggle every time ! my only real complaint be that the time display be so small it be virtually useless , unless you happen to be within 6 '' of the thing - which be well within lethal range of a dalek -lrb- even one that be 7 '' tall -rrb- ! the projection clock work well , but would be more useful if it stay on continuously . this product would be better if it have the option of plug-in power , which would allow for a continuous wall\/ceiling display by the projector . the battery only nature of it give it a toy-like feel , rather than that of a real , usefully functional alarm clock . of course , the point of the thing be really just to look cool and get some grin - which it most defintely do . I can not seem to walk by it without push the button to hear it say `` exterminate !!! '' Chuckle every time .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I think its a good travel clock and certainly easy to set , etc. . however , it be impossible to read the time in the dark and that would be the only improvement need to give it 5 star . so far , I have take it on two trip and it perform just fine .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a fairly low end clock . the clock display be dim and will only work after insert three aa battery , the attach power cord be only for the projection portion . once the battery be install , the display on the clock be on the dim end of the spectrum . the projection be great and it be good to have focus and rotation control . for the projection portion I give this clock \*\*\*\*\* , but for the overall clock , it only get \*\*\*
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock be quite functional , the only issue be that the light be too bright in the dark , make the number blur .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	take way too long to eve start delivery . it be 4 day & I a still recieve the same lame message `` shipping soon '' . stop talk and do it !!! if you want you item do not shop at amazon !
AlarmClock	POS	5	I buy one of these for household use and like it enough to buy another one . -lrb- my strategy be to have several inexpensive alarm clock scatter throughout my apartment so that by the time I have find they all , I be awake . -rrb- the folding design allow the device to be pretty light without be easy to tip over . instead of buy yet another one , I be go to try out the  nap mate  the button on the Travel-Mate be make from harder plastic and be probably more durable . we shall see : -rrb-
AlarmClock	POS	5	we need a weather radio because we live in tornado country . when it get stormy , the 9 volt battery backup on this NOAA weather radio keep the weather report come in . we live near a city and have no trouble receive the NOAA broadcast . this unit cost as much as any of the standard weather radio I be look at , but it also have radio , alarm and a very large digital clock display . the spec say the display be 1 '' but I think it be closer to 2 '' . it be not a designer piece , it be purely functional , but that be what we buy it for . a cool feature be that you can set you alarm clock to wake you to the weather report . if you be travel , that be pretty handy .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock do exactly what it be advertise to do . it be small , it be cute , it work on a aa battery and the alarm be loud enough to wake up a normal person . I like the finish and the retro look . what I especially like be that be have a little button you push to see the face light up in the middle of the night ... without have it light up all the time . it be a awesome clock for $ 10 . I receive exactly the clock that be represent .
AlarmClock	POS	5	we love this clock . I buy it for my 8 year old daughter who can sleep through anything . anything , that be , except this clock . you can hear the alarm all over the house . I be glad I finally find something that will wake she up .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	what good be a clock radio that do not keep time . this piece of junk be recieve on Friday and send back on Monday . during the weekend , I set the time three time and within 5 to 6 hour the clock revert to the initial setting , and the radio preset be also lose .
AlarmClock	POS	5	the clock be very cute . the snooze button be in a great place , and the increase volume of the alarm be something helpful to most people . good buy , quick service .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	it be the biggest size of LED you can find -lrb- 2.5 '' -rrb- . it be also very bright that you can read it well even with bright sun in the room . my only complain be there be a poor contact between the clock and the base that house the battery compartment . the clock go blank after I fold it down and reopen it again . I have to slap it to get the LED 's to light up again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	it be great for my husband . he love it and show it off to other in company . everybody say it be cute .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I buy the attachment and it trigger my other brighter lamp which work like a charm . the clock 's light , so-called brighter , be a joke . that original clock bulb sometimes come on , and 99 % of the time , do not come on at all . the control to just turn on the light in a dark room mean to touch the second to the bottom right seed size button and hold it till it brighten up . so that be annoying . there be not many choice out there and from what I have see its adequate for I with the attachment . without it , this so call new brighter bulb would not do a thing for I . and I have it right next to my bed . so unless you be face it , how will you know its on ? the term `` bright '' be relative . for I it be - at its brightest - as bright as a candle .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be just what we need for we bedroom . it be very easy to read from across the room at night .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the Soleil Sunrise Alarm clock do what be advertise it help wake you up easier and more alert that a standard alarm clock . the radio do work , but only on strong station . I also quickly remove the translucent housing over the bulb , do that allow the lamp do its job . the clock work best in pitch black where the lamp will light up the whole room . be the alarm worth it , if you need to wake up early in the morning , and then yes . could it be better , yes a clear lamp housing , and a better radio would be great addition .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	the price be good . however , the back light be very dim . the time be difficult to read in the dark . I purchase for use as a bedside clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	do I receive a update version since the previous comment . . hmm . I must have . First of all , I love this product and here 's why : -lrb- I be listen to Rainforest as I write this , and I be in heaven -rrb- there be a volume range you can adjust for the sound from from 1 - 8 range . I only need to set mine at 2 for a audible , yet gentle and clear sound in my bedroom . this machine can be use in a small room to a large , spacious room with the range capability . you can adjust the backlight brightness on the display to 3 setting : hus , Med , or Lo there be also a Daylight Savings Time button on the back that can be activate . the 20 different sound to choose from be generous compare to other nature sound product . the sound be clear with combined layer of soft background to up front stronger sound - very accurate and realistic you can set a timer for sound if you choose and the sound will automatically stop at the end of the time . two separate alarm setting -lrb- can choose a sound or a beep alarm -rrb- the price be very , very affordable ! product be lightweight and sturdy , compact to fit gracefully on a small bedstand , sleek and well balanced . to parent with newborn : there be a heartbeat sound ! what more can I say ... sharper image produce another quality product . I previously have a expensive wooden chime alarm clock , and when the chime begin to sound like a low clunk after two year , it become almost worthless , except for the digital clock image , so live and learn ! I be jubliant and satisfied that I find a even better product with so many feature and sound option ...
AlarmClock	POS	5	very nice clock . it be attractive , the display contain the information I want , the numeral be large , it be light & small enough for travel . be solar power be a big plus as no more battery to buy . that the temperature read a couple of degree too warm be minor . set up be straight forward . a lighter background would allow view at a greater distance . I do not use the alarm so can not comment on that and the atomic part be not relevant for I . solid 5 star .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I have have it for a month and use it daily as a alarm clock and occasionally for a nap timer . keep perfect time as far as I can tell . thing I wish it have : 1 . graduate alarm volume ... start off low , then grow louder if not snooze or shut off . 2 . larger\/smoother alarm turn off switch . 3 . no beep sound when you hit the snooze button to see what time it be at night . 4 . ability to operate snooze button when unit be close .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this little alarm clock so much , I have several throughout my house . pro : \* 24 hour time -lrb- a huge plus for people who have to work shift -rrb- \* nap timer -lrb- I use this feature all the time to wait 15 minute to see if I have correctly treat a hypoglycemic episode -rrb- . you can nap up to 4 hour . \* small and portable con : \* can only set the date and time forward ; you have to scroll through the entire cycle if you have overshoot you value . \* can not turn the back light off -lrb- but it only stay on for about 4 seconds -rrb- \* can not turn the nap timer off \* can not see how much time you have leave on you nap
AlarmClock	POS	5	love this travel alarm with nap feature . I have be purchase this feature 3 time since 1996 . I use it for nap of course , as well as a timer for kid program , do housework , and even bake . it be my main alarm clock in the house and camper .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love that I do not have to set my alarm every night anymore . I be sure my husband agree as the alarm clock I have purchase to replace my alarm clock that die make irritating beep to indicate success at change any setting . I tend to keep thing for a long time -lrb- have the alarm clock that die for over 20 year -rrb- , so I be very happy to find something I be sure I can live with hopefully for another 20 . I do have to switch from wake to the radio to use the beep alarm because I be ignore the radio - but that be just a personal problem . so far , this be a great alarm .
AlarmClock	POS	5	a excellent alarm clock . Easy to set up and very reliable . good volume control . the only downside be that it do not receive the radio signal very well .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the idea of this alarm clock be very appealing : a alarm clock that can be easily individualize for the day of the week . here , however , be the reality in two bullet point : 1 . the tuner be awful . within ten minute of have locate a staion the focus have slip and you have to relocate it or listen to gradually worsten static . 2 . the alarm clock component be about 95 % accurate . think on that ... 5 % of the time you will not be awaken . my partner and I have have it for a year and for the longest time think that one of we have do something wrong in set it . or we be sure that we have do it right but wake up late have not make we tardy for anything . this morning be the last straw , though . 5 % , when you be depend on this little monster be not good enough . and now , off to shop Amazon for a new clock radio .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I purchase this clock for my 95 old year mother . she like it be ease of use and it be durability . also , it be a attractive clock . my mom be very happy with it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I really can not say how this be because I buy it as a gift for my grand-daughter for Christmas ... . she love Legos and Star Wars ... so if it be she writting -lrb- she be 8 yr . old -rrb- I guess she would say she love it ...
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this thing only work twice for I . today it sit on my computer desk display the time only . if you need to make someone late for work , here ya go : -lrb-
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this little clock . it be small and slender -lrb- like a a compact powder -rrb- and have super easy function . will not travel without it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	the alarm clock be small enough and lightweight to carry throughout you trip , and be reliable for the day you need to wake up to catch a plane or bus ride . the clock fold to a compact size that prevent the user from accidentally click the button . when the clock be unfold , the case serve as a stand . the blue glow of the screen be easy on the eye , especially when you eye be accustom to the darkness . use 1 aaa battery , which I do not need to change in 7.5 month . the alarm be loud enough to wake I from sleep without scare I . only quirk about the clock be the snooze function , which allow I to sleep only a extra 4 minute before the alarm go off again .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the display be difficult to read in Daytime -lrb- black on gray -rrb- unless you press on Vader 's head for a 5 sec backlight . if the display be like any normal digital clock with blue\/red number , it would be 5 star as the body detail be great .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I do by the adapter to plug it in a a few extra bird card . I really enjoy wake up to the sound of bird every morning . it bring a little sunshine to cold Wisconsin winter . over all it be a good product and I be glad I buy it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this little clock be great . it glow at night and you can set the amount of glow . Easy to read and set . great value for the money . would order again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	Retraction from 1\/11\/2011 . I write a sassy report about return on a malfunction clock I purchase . after simply navigate `` my Amazon Account '' , I learn how simple it really be to return a item . I regret be quick to comment . I be a first time buyer .
AlarmClock	POS	5	everything about this alarm clock be great . the nap timer be good when you need to time anything . look good on a desk .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my husband be a huge sw fan who receive this for he birthday . he be thrilled ! great look toy , with the bonus of be a clock\/mp3 player\/etc . good stuff !
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I get this product with the optional module which turn on another lamp . that really help make the overall `` dawn '' usably bright , but the optional module stop work after about a year . the idea of wake to a light like sunrise work really well for I , but this product be cheaply make and another brand would likely be a better choice . the radio be very poor , I have to take it apart and pull the coil internal antenna wire out and drape it up the wall to get any reception - and I live in a major metro area with many strong station ! the scratchy reception may be more effective at annoy I awake than the light . the product could be really good with a infusion of better quality .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the design of the display be great , I like how you can go both back and forth through the sound , without have to cycle through they all , and it come with a lot of sound -lrb- though some I can not see anyone want to sleep to -rrb- . the date and time be easy to set . I do not use the alarm function , as I prefer to use my cell phone alarm , so I can not speak to the functionality of that . some other review have make comment about the shortness of the track before repeat , but it be not something I notice too much . I end up return it after two day . the biggest problem for I be this low hum that emanate from it through any sound , and I find it really distract , because I be listen to the buzz hum more than the sound -lrb- ebb Tide -rrb- . I look up some review , and find other people with the same issue , which apparently turn out to be a cheap power supply cause the speaker to vibrate inappropriately -lrb- or something , I do not exactly understand the concept -rrb- . Learning that , I realize it be a design flaw , and not my unit , so I drop the idea of just exchange it . the other problem I have with it , though by itself it be not enough to make I want to return it , be the lack of real volume control . you have loud , louder , loudest , blow you ear drum , and 11 . the lowest setting -lrb- 1 -rrb- be barely tolerable for I on most sound , and utterly unacceptable on other . have I decide to keep it , I would have relocate it to the other end of the room . I end up replace it with  sound Oasis S-650-01 Sleep Sound therapy System  I only just get it today , so I have no review of it yet , but I can tell you there be no annoying audio buzz . also , some store will price match with Amazon if you print out the page , so I actually get it for less than the Amazon price .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be the perfect size clock for travel . it be small and easily fit in you cosmetic bag . it have a alarm that be not obtrusive . I like a analog clock much better than a digital - much easier to set !!
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I purchase this clock when it be power by a c battery and would have rate it five Stars . unfortunately when I re-order it recently , it have be redesign . it be now power by 3 aa battery which do not fit into its compartment , and so do not provide power to the clock for it to run ! a clock that do not run be no use to I or anyone else . I be return the new clock along with several other I order with the same problem .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the product I receive do not work . after a few hour the clock would start flash , as though it have shut off and then turn on again . the time setting would be lose . I return the product .
AlarmClock	POS	4	Easy to read . Easy to set . not for the heavy sleeper . the alarm do a gradual buildup in volume . even at it be loudest it be not very loud . it be plenty for I . my son be a heavy sleeper and the alarm on this clock would be worthless .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock never work . the light do not come on and the alarm make no sound . this be a piece of junk . I be surprised Amazon would sell this clock it be such poor quality .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be take a upcoming exam and need a clock that help I on time control . when I receive it , it be much bigger than I think , but it be not necessary a bad thing . it be easier for I to spot it wherever I put it on the desk . what I like this clock the best be that it be silent . you do not hear the second hand movement like most other quartz clock do . I also like other feature of this clock , like it glow in the dark , and progress alarm sound , etc. . plus the price be very affordable .
AlarmClock	POS	5	buy this product because it show 2 different time zone so you can set it such that it show the time where you be and where you be love one be when you be travel or live in other part of the world . have not use it as a alarm yet . it be small and do not weigh much and easy to put on you nightstand for example .
AlarmClock	POS	5	Got 2 of these for my nephew for Christmas . they love they . as of today there have be problem with they . great product that sure make 2 5 year old boy happy .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this little clock be exactly what I expect and seem to work fine , so far . the blue backlight be nice . one small complaint - I do not think qa be top on the list with the maufacturer - on mine , the snooze button be upside down ! it still work , just look a bit odd . but what can you expect for the price ?
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this radio as a Christmas present for a office mate . I want something small and not too expensive since in a office building thing can disapear . the reception in the building be ususaly not so good and that be a concern . three month later I be happy to report that this one work fine . we have have no problem with the radio or the CD player .
AlarmClock	POS	5	buy this clock at Fred Meyers tonight on sale . $ 7.99 . if it hold up , it will make a good travel clock . the alarm be just loud enough , and annoying enough to wake one up if they go to bed sober . the pic show the light but you need to `` pinch '' the button to make it lite up . it have control for each select option . but not fore and back , so if you go past just keep go . but I buy it so I could see the time . my XM radio time be only 6 mm high so I need something else this 25 mm display be what I need . and when the power go out it will wake I because it do not give up till the button be hit .
