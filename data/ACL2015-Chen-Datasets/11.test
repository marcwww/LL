AlarmClock	NEU	3	I own my previous Westclox Travelmate for more than 12 year . it be the only alarm clock I own - or need . very reliable & accurate - for most of those year . it begin to go screwy only the last couple of year I have it . so I replace it with another Travelmate , just a couple of month ago . at first I be very pleased with my purchase , but this one be already exhibit the bug of the first Travelmate - almost right out of the gate . the time setting and alarm setting often change - spontaneously and mysteriously - all by themselves , sometimes several time during the same day ! since the problem have not go away , and since I can not depend upon it to process time accurately -lrb- a core requirement for a alarm clock , would not you say ? -rrb- , I have decide to replace it with something better . since it cost only a few buck , it simply be not a good use of my time to go through the hassle and expense of return it for a refund . Westclox , be you listen ?  Westclox Travelmate
AlarmClock	NEG	2	Didnot keep this clock , be not what I want ... cheap clock with too many knob for my taste ...
AlarmClock	NEG	2	love how this clock look . but it do not keep time ... every week or so its behind twenty minute so I would not use it for alarm purpose . I be consider rebuy another one hope that one will keep time because I be attach to how it look in my little girl nursery . and yes , I have change the battery many time to no avail .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this clock be great for shift worker . another reviewer mention that tap the snooze button more than once multiply the user define snooze time by the number of tap . that be a nice surprise that I do not read about in the instruction booklet . the battery backup be nice in the event of a power outage . however , my old clock would keep track of the time internally and still sound the alarm -lrb- even the radio -rrb- at the correct time with no ac power apply . this clock save its setting but will not wake you if the power be off when you alarm should sound . as be mention in another review , the backup battery holder be cheap and oddly support . this force I to re-enter the setting the first time I move the clock . a wire on the holder must have be over the battery contact . I bent it away and it seem to retain the setting now . there be room for improvement but this be the first of its kind and it do what I need it to do . maybe the upcome `` Executive '' model will address some of these thing . regardless , I be happy with it .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a very nice little clock , especially for the price . I have no trouble get it to pick up a signal when initially set it up , and it have have no problem hold onto a signal wherever I have it in my house . I have not really have any trouble with any of the thing the other reviewer have note , except for one , and it be a pretty major flaw : the clock beep -lrb- loudly -rrb- every time you press a button . this include the button you use to turn on the light in the middle of the night , which I never use since it would disturb my husband . I decide not to return it because it meet my need for a travel clock\/alarm , and I really like that it be a atomic clock . I find it easy to check the alarm time setting , and have not have any issue with accidentally change the time zone .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have have this clock for just a couple of day but I be extremely impressed . I place it on the dresser in my bedroom and it be easily readable . I have have projection clock and these end up in the trash over time because the projection fade or become fuzzy - and I have have several - but this new clock without projection be the cat 's meow ! I feel that I need to see the time when I awake in the night and this clock have not disappointed I - the number be huge , clear and just perfect . the battery backup take a 9 volt and it be easily install . the packaging be not too much -lrb- I hate those form fitting one you have to slice you finger up to open -rrb- - this packaging be clear plastic but pop right off . needless to say I be very pleased and highly recommend this clock .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a awesome figurine . however , the snooze only go off for 2 minute , and if during that time you do not hit the snooze it will not go off again . the clock do not light up so you can see it in the dark , you have to push on the head to make it light up for a minute . so it be not a very good alarm , unless you set another one for back up .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I want a alarm clock to wake I up with something other than beep or a radio . I try the Sony ICFC707 clock radio which have more sophisticated programming than this clock . but the Sony have only 5 sound , all of which be too innocuous to penetrate my sleep mind . this clock 's designer include some sound for people like I who want a soothing sound to wake they up -lrb- I use the wind chime setting -rrb- . all in all , I miss the Sony 's programming , which include the 5 day programming . also with the Sony , you can choose different sound and volume level for each alarm and sleep function . this clock , as far as I know , have the same volume across the board . also , like other reviewer say , the increment between the volume setting -lrb- from vol 1 to vol level 2 -rrb- be just too wide . some of the sound be pretty hard to distinguish from each other , -lrb- ebb tide , oceanside & surf up , for example -rrb- so I be a bit unsure why they even bother to include they separately . the wind chime loop seem very short ; for wake up , it be just fine , for go to sleep , it might drive some people batty . pro : pleasant sound to wake up to which you can control the volume level con : somewhat unsophisticated programming -- one volume for all , no 5\/2 day alarm choice
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have have 3 of these clock over the past 15 year . my 2nd one just die after several hard year of use ... travel literally around the world multiple time . be sooo happy to find a new one on Amazon . this clock be the perfect size -lrb- smaller than a business card -rrb- , it light up with the press of the big `` light '' button , and it be easy to change the time & alarm . and it do not make unwanted beeping noise every time you want to press a button . they have be very durable and ... best of all ... it slide very easily into a briefcase or shave kit bag . it be perfect for the business traveler !
AlarmClock	POS	4	this clock have some cool feature . the bell be somewhat loud , but the flash light usually wake I up first . and I love it be look , with a couple of exception . as a designer , I be bother by the transparency of the left side of the clock , especially when my bedside table lamp be illuminate . also , the light for the clock face have a orange-colored hot spot by the ' 3 ' . I be not sure why that be , and if it be all of they or just mine . maybe I be be too picky ... I try to imagine that the original clock have these same defect , and try to love the clock anyway .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock be excellent for a bare bone digital clock . when I first plug it in , the time be less than one second off atomic time . I have plug and unplug the clock many time the past 6 month and the time be now about 26 seconds faster than actual time . the time and calendar can be manually adjust -- read the manual . the Daylight Saving Time can be disabled for portion of the U.S. which do not observe DST . the DST setting can be set to the new DST rule or old DST rule in the unlikely event Congress decide to go back to the old rule . by default , the clock be set to the new DST rule . in case of power failure , the display will turn off , but the clock will still run and the alarm will sound if the alarm be activate . the clock use 4 lr44 battery as backup . the manual say the battery last 3 year before need replacement . when change the battery , leave the clock plug in . this way , you will not need to manually reset the time and calendar . the downside to this clock be the blinking colon '' : '' and the display be bright . there be no dimmer switch .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	it be so small it do not bother I at all . if light really really bother you this may work . it be a lot of money for very little product . I now have a biobrite with white noise . I wish the BioBrite have a radio instead of a beep backup , but I be not asleep by then anyway since the light have wake I up .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	this little alarm clock be ok but there be 2 main flaw with it . First and foremost I sleep deeply and snooze a lot before finally wake . this clock only allow 4 snooze , 4 minute apart , before the alarm just stop go off . also , when you have a travel alarm clock with a fold over cover like this please put a gap and a slight hole so the snooze button can be hit immediately without open the cover . my girlfriend have a alarm clock almost identical to this from Timex that have long since be discontinue and it handle all these feature perfectly . you would think something so simple would be easy to find . hopefully they improve this one someday . in all other way the clock be great .
AlarmClock	POS	4	it arrive and work as promise . the only negative be that the light do not light up enough to see the time at night when you push the button .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I see this radio at target and think it look really cool . I like the old-fashioned styling and the blue display . unfortunately , I quickly find two major problem with this . as someone state earlier , the display be too bright-it light up my room like a full moon and there seem to be no way to turn it down . the second major problem be that the volume dial do not turn smoothly , rather it be notch in such a way that there really be no way to control the volume . on the unit I have , either the volume be down all the way , okay at the first notch , and way too loud on the second notch . I like the nature sound , but the bird sound be rather silly because they sound like snippet from a dozen different habitat and be distract . the flowing water sound nice , though . tuning be interesting because the frequency be in 0.05 increment . so , to go from 90.5 to 90.7 , you have to push the up button four time instead of just once . while this be not a issue to go up one frequency , it be annoy to go up 5 or 10 . lastly , the speaker poop out on the second night . so , the radio be absolutely useless at this point . the radio be nice look and a little retro , but unfortunately , there be just too many design problem that make it a waste of money and time . it be go back to target first thing Saturday morning .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I buy this for my teen daughter that be a hard sleeper . ordinary clock never wake she ; this one however , shake she and wake she . in fact , it wake everyone in the house on both floor . the color be rich and the vibrator be really powerful . I love it and so do she . now , I can be at work without have to worry whether or not she be go to get up . she have literally no option with this clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my mother want a clock with number she could see at night . the extra large number , the largest I could find , be very clear from across the room to she . it be use also as a sort of `` night light '' to see about the room if she have to get up in the night . you also have the option of dim the number if it seem too bright for you . Easy to set alarm , and shut off which she love . at a very reasonable cost it be a perfect gift for the senior citizen or anyone who have difficulty see .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I have read the review about this Elgin Travel Alarm clock , but it be cheap enough I think I would give it a try inspite of the review . plus it be cheap enough that if it do not work , I would have spend more time and money to send it back so I have decide in advance to live with it and chalk it up to a lesson learn . besides , I have a similar model make by Timex that last a long time . question : where have Timex go ? so now , I will live with it but I will warn other ! as soon as I put the battery in , I find out the light do not work . I buy this model specifically for the light ! DO not waste your money !
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a okay alarm clock that work well , be easy to set , have a nice snooze feature , and have a initial beeping alarm that be not too loud but loud enough to wake I with out startling I . if ignore , the alarm get louder & more insistent by degree - a good feature but I never need it . it be larger than I expect -lrb- bigger than a softball , for reference -rrb- but not huge . the second hand sweep silently around the dial , no tick - nice . I give this a 3-star instead of 4 because the adjustable back light can not be turn off , only down to quite dim . however , the item description lead one to believe it can be turn off . I do not like a light shine at I all night , so this clock be a constant irritation . if I have know it can not be turn off , I would not have purchase the clock . also , since the back light can not be turn off , it make the push-button light rather pointless .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I own one fo these clock , and I be shop for a new one . this clock just be not bright enough to illuminate my room properly . I dont ` wake up . : - -lrb-
AlarmClock	NEU	3	the screen never dim off . you have three scale of back-light to choose from but no off -lrb- rather annoy if you like to sleep in the dark and have a watch to check at time -rrb- . also , the sound be 5-10 second recording that be loop over and over , and you start to notice it as you clear you mind to go to sleep . it do its job , but do not expect total relaxation , nor a natural like feel .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I be disappoint in the fm audio quality for the FM broadcast band . it sound limited and mushy . also it could not reliably pick up a distant station which I can now get on a boombox -lrb- I return this unit -rrb- . it be very well make and very easy to program and I would recommend it to anyone who only want FM as a extra and do not plan on listen to FM a lot .
AlarmClock	POS	4	a little expensive , but its very straight forward . for example `` alarm : on - off '' . you do not have to be a psychic to understand the control . very refreshing .
AlarmClock	POS	4	we have a Sony dream machine with the atomic clock function . it have no battery backup and occasionally somehow `` lose '' the signal for the clock and end up with the incorrect time . this atomic clock radio do catch the signal and do have the battery backup function . it be not a $ 50 or $ 100 radio , but do the job well . the only drawback have be the small switch which turn the alarm on and off . for the price , I would buy it again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a cool-looking clock that work great as a alarm . the main reason we buy it be because the digital face of we previous alarm clock be too bright . you can adjust the brightness of the face of this clock or not have it light at all . the `` moonbeam '' wake-up component do not work for we as far as wake we up , but the alarm that follow be pleasant and loud enough to work . but not too loud or obnoxious . this clock look great in we bedroom - very retro and classy . we want the green one for we guest room .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have a similar clock that I buy in Tokyo several year ago . the original be a Seiko that still work but the alarm on\/off switch become loose and can easily turn off r on just by move the clock in the night . I choose this clock because it be very similar . it work as advertise . the alarm be loud enough to wake the heaviest sleeper without be too annoying . if I have to complain , it would be about the size of the display which be smaller than I have hope . however , it be easily read from the bedside .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	my wife purchase this alarm clock for I for Christmas 2007 . it be the second piece of Coby electronic equipment that I have own . my experience be that Coby build extremely cheap -lrb- meaning , poor quality -rrb- product . my complaint with this product be : 1 -rrb- the product do not keep accurate time -lrb- gain about 7-8 minute per month - most likely a electronics design flaw that recur in each of these alarm clock -rrb- . 2 -rrb- the product `` hum '' through the speaker -lrb- a short in the internal electronics due to poor circuit board design - also a design flaw that probably recur in each of these alarm clock -rrb- . interestingly , when the product be power ON , like when the user want to listen to a cd but have not yet hit the play button , the hum quit . BUT , if the unit be leave ON accidentally , the alarm do NOT work . I know . I power the unit on to get the annoying hum to stop and be late to work the next day because the alarm never sound . 3 -rrb- CD door be overly difficult to open and close -lrb- a coefficient of friction design flaw that be also recur , probably -rrb- . 4 -rrb- the lead display be overly bright and no dimmer switch be feature -lrb- yet another design flaw -rrb- . 5 -rrb- all plastic part be extremely cheap . White plastic cabinet part be not the same color of white -lrb- do not match -rrb- . silver paint on button will obviously soon wear off , etc. . while this alarm clock have all of the feature that I be look for in a alarm clock -lrb- except for the dimmer switch -rrb- , the aforementioned list of design flaw force I to return the product as defective . bottom line : very cheaply build !
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be such a attractive clock . number shine bright in a variety of color . it get my pre teen up . amazing . she try to beat the alarm . haha !! Works great !! wonderful gift idea .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the auto-time set be a defect in disguise . we buy a older version of this clock in 2002 or so . it be hardwire to change the time -lrb- for Daylight Saving Time , DST -rrb- on the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October . spiffy ! the radio time feed from wwv provide Universal Coordinated Time -lrb- GMT -rrb- , with no signal indicate the time change , so the clock be design hardwire with a offset from that , change at fix date . then come the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which `` change the change day '' to the second Sunday in March , and the first Sunday in November , start in 2007 . we older clock do not read the newspaper , so base on its old programming , it `` spring forward '' two week late and `` fall back '' a week early . that mean we have to change the time zone four time per year to keep it accurate -lrb- in we case from Pacific to Mountain time and back as need -rrb- . if you be absolutely sure congress will never ever ever change the DST date in the future , buy the clock , it be well make and accurate . if the manufacturer add a manual DST switch , or figure out some clever way to tell the clock when congress change the date , it be also good . BUT if congress meddle with the time change date again , and the 2012 change date be still hardwire in , you will probably angrily discard this `` automatic '' clock after a year or two of setting and reset it , and miss a appointment or two . then you will buy one of the manual set one , which might be off a few minute , but not a hour . it be a pity that we lord and master in Washington do not think about detail like this when they ignore the sun and tinker with the time . more afternoon golf time for they , while you kid wait for the morning school bus in the cold and dark .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this clock with it be so easily read numeral . it can be see so clearly in the dark , and from quite a distance . I buy it to replace another like it -lrb- different brand -rrb- which quit work after many year . I know when that one stop I have to have another as quickly as it could be deliver . if you have trouble see , and even if you do not , this be the clock for you if you want to see the time from a distance . thank you Amazon for get it here so quickly even with the free shipping .
AlarmClock	POS	5	after use for 15 year everyday and everywhere , somebody sit down on it and break it . I be so happy they be still availabe . until I get they for all my grandchild who be not bear yet , please keep make this wonderful clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be redo my apartment and want a old fashion look alarm clock . this fit the bill with its art deco look . I have the pink one and it be a beautiful shade of pink . not bright like some here have say . think pepto bismol ! nor be it the bubble gum pink that little girl love . it be more a medium shade of pink . it have a silver band around the bottom that make it so attractive . now for what be more important , how it work . it be easy as pie , you just set the time and the alarm follow the direction in which to turn the knob in back . switch the alarm to on and you be do . when it go off , first you will get 5 minute of a gentle light that flash to wake you up . if after 5 minute , you do not respond than the alarm go off . it be more of a old fashion alarm clock sound than the buzz of new one . also , if during the night you have a power failure it have a battery operate backup . it just take 2 aa battery . I be surprised how reasonable the price for this one be . I have price other for a lot more . it be a real bargain and I be glad to have it now . I would highly recommend this alarm clock to anyone who be look for one .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a really unique product , it be extremely loud , and it vibrate the bed , so it really do what it say . however it do not wake my 13-year-old up , I wish they make something that would spray water on she ... maybe that would work .
AlarmClock	POS	4	little bigger than I think it would be , but work great and loud enough to wake I up .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I purchase the Timex Solar atomic clock with the last few month and it be work fine and be easy to set up not like some I have have in the pass . it be accurate , easy to read and right on . R.L. Bush
AlarmClock	NEG	2	recieve this clock and like everything about it except the atomic feature do not work so I be return it . have try to set the atomic clock many time include overnight to no avail . if you do not need the atomic feature it be light weight and stable on the bedside table unlike other atomic clock I have have .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock be innacurate and problematic throughout its brief life , and then it have a stroke , and then it die .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my eight year old son want this for he room . it come in on time . the packaging be in perfect condition . it be easy to use , my son have use it to wake up for school by himself . look great on he night stand . he put it in a different pose everyday .
AlarmClock	POS	4	its not a big clock , its around 12 inch . the light turn red when you push the head . I really like it . the only thing i didnt like its that the alarm have a very low sound .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the snooze and light feature do not work on Darth Vader , no matter how much I push he head . I 'll have to return it for a warranty check . have anyone else have this problem ? Edit : Amazon have be very helpful with the warranty .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this sun alarm 3 year ago and it have make a huge difference in how I feel after wake up in the morning . alarm clock use to make I feel edgy and tense but wake up to a slow simulated dawn be really peaceful . I have the backup radio alarm set to go off if the light do not wake I but so far I have only need that maybe a handful of time in 3 year . you do have to make sure the alarm be eye-level next to the bed for it to work really well though . the only gripe I really have be that there be a way to dim the display light but it be somewhat complicated and everytime the power go off -lrb- which be a lot in Florida -rrb- , I have to look it up again . but other than that , this be a decent product that accomplish the goal of wake up peacefully . :0 -rrb-
AlarmClock	POS	4	I really like this clock\/sound machine . there be one big problem . the volume control control both the sound -lrb- ocean tide , summer night , etc. -rrb- and the alarm volume . so if you want to have the soothing sound lull you to sleep at night at a low volume -lrb- which I can not imagine want it very loud -rrb- then the alarm volume be the same and will probably not wake you up . sad defect for a otherwise fine item .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I already have this clock but I order it for my niece , my mom also have the same clock along with my neighbor ! no matter where you look , this be the better deal , you can not find it any cheaper , even with shipping cost . have a light go off instead of a noise go off in you ear from be in a dead sleep be a lot more peaceful for sure . it fit into the style of my 1950 's home for sure ... Amy
AlarmClock	NEG	2	this alarm clock be easy to use and set up . it have a large time read out . the biggest draw back be the soft alarm . it need need to be much louder .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have have my Sunrise clock for over five year and it have make get up , especially in the winter when it be so dark , much easier and less jarring than a blare alarm sound out of the blue . it finally die yesterday , and I order a replacement today . I 'll have to make do with a traditional alarm clock until mine come . I highly recommend the sunrise alarm clock !
AlarmClock	NEG	2	when I google `` slow wake alarm '' this product come up a number of time , so naturally I read the reveiw , like what I see and order it . however , when I recieve my item I be far from impressed . what I be look for be a alarm clock that would start out slowly and quietly then progressively get louder . this one do not . grant it be not a advertised feature , but I feel that it be something that come along with the product from the other review I have read . in reality this be a regular alarm clock that wake you up with you choice of beep or nature sound . not what I want . this one get a big thumb down .
AlarmClock	POS	4	in the photo , this clock look blue . it be in fact , black , not blue as picture . not enough reason -lrb- quite -rrb- to return it , but disappointing . the dial do glow nicely when it be dark if put into auto mode , or when the snooze button be hold down . it be slightly bigger than I expect , but not a great deal . I like the fact that the alarm start quite subtly , and get louder and faster in stage . it be on the softer side , for a alarm , which I prefer , but if you be a heavy sleeper , it may not work for you . the dial glow be quite green , but not horribly bright . not nearly as bright as my cellphone , for example .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I agree that the light be too dim to be of any practical use . why do they even bother ? but I find that hotel have clock next to the bed that I can check if necessary . I just do not trust the hotel clock alarm and they be usually way too complex to set . so I have be use these for year with total confidence . they be reliable , simple , easy to pack , indestructable -lrb- suitcase have be store in blaze hot and freezing cold attic -rrb- and easy to set . since I figure the battery be go to go one of these day -lrb- they be yearssss old -rrb- , and it be easier to buy new than find replacement battery -lrb- much less find a screwdriver small enough to open the back -rrb- ... time to order a few more .
AlarmClock	POS	5	item replace the clock that my father have since the 50 's . Terrific item '
AlarmClock	POS	5	DIDD not buy it for alarm purpose . BOUGHT IT to keep time . and that , it do , oh SO WELL . ALSO have a very large screen for easier viewing . all in all , a good piece .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock will not keep the right time . it keep kick back a hour . I would not buy this product again . I have have other La Crosse item that I have really like . this one be no good !
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I get this think a larger clock would be easier to see from part way across the room . I need to watch the second hand to time my stretch exercise . unfortunately , I didnt look closely at the picture . the silver second hand be almost invisible unless I move the clock to right next to my face so I can see it . oh well . the clock work well so far , and I like the nice green color of the face at night . it be very cheerful and good company . just look closely . a red second hand be easier to see . that be the alarm hand .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I buy one , love it , play it all the time , use the alarm function to wake up . today , it be not work . nothing I can do to make the light come back on , make the alarm work again . if I touch a button , it come back on for a few seconds . battery be use for back up only so not sure why it be not work ! need another clock now ...
AlarmClock	NEG	2	receive the Westclox Travelmate today , and just print the return label . the face light do not illuminate ; AM\/PM do not appear on the face ; the alarm be barely discernable , and yes ... my hearing be excellent . cheap , cheap , cheap . the designer need to go back to the draw board .
AlarmClock	POS	4	product arrive in a timely fashion . the `` inside box '' - a.k.a the manufacturer box be a lil bang up , corner of the box be crumple . product still work fine though .
AlarmClock	POS	4	leave my previous travel-size alarm clock in Paris and go through a couple different one -lrb- slight more expensive -rrb- before I get this guy . I be very satisfied . it be very compact -lrb- travel + + + -rrb- , cheap -lrb- always a + -rrb- , and pretty simple . everything have dedicate control . my only issue be the same `` feel '' of the display and alarm on\/off control , so I have miss alarm occasionally because I simply slide the wrong slider -lrb- display control instead of set the alarm slider to ON -rrb- . still like it a lot after about six month .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a decent alarm clock . it be fully hollow inside so it be extremely light . lead light do help to not drain out battery . light be extremely bright and somewhat distracting . Shipping & handle be poor because something be rattle around when I receive product .  glowing led color mood change Digital Alarm clock
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a handsome product ; a storm trooper clock that be reliable to wake my son up to school everyday . do not have to change battery often ; a bit pricey , but recommend .
AlarmClock	POS	4	Works fine except that it seem to drift toward run a bit fast over time . large display be easily visible from many foot away .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	this clock break in less than 6 month , most likely because I use it everyday and do a lot of snooze . it be small so do not take up much space on the night table or suitcase . if it be sturdier it would get more star .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I buy this alarm clock for my young daughter in oct 2010 . she sleep with white noise and I think that buy a clock with the noise feature build in would be both space-saving and money-saving . it look nice and be easy to use . however , as other reviewer have say , the volume setting be not ideal ... set at 1 its very quiet , at 2 its annoyingly loud . it be nice to have the dual alarm - we set the second alarm for 8pm , put she to bed at 7:15 and when the bird chirp she know to put she book down , its light out . but any dual alarm will serve that purpose , with or without fancy noise . and here the worst part : March 2012 , one random morning the alarm never go off for school , and in addition to she too-loud white noise the clock be make a horrible buzz sound which can not be shut off . we unplug it and remove the battery , but when we reinstall the battery , the screen be mess up and it play sound 1 constanly -lrb- very loudly ! -rrb- , none of the setting button work and it can not be shut off . so after pay a decent price for a brand name , it last less than 18 mo and I be back to shopping for a alarm clock and a noise-maker . this certainly do NOT meet my expectation !
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I have never take the time to make a REVIEW BUT MUST SAY great design , great option -lrb- 2 alarm -rrb- , EVERYTHING great except one BIG THING ! I read this problem before I buy THIS & TOOK A CHANCE anyway . when you listen to the nature sound , ANY one ! about 30 minute in you fall asleep then wake up to a very loud pop almost like a shooting noise . picture feel RELAXED & FALLING ASLEEP to SOFT NATURE sound ... then wake up to ALMOST LIKE POPPING POPCORN RIGHT NEXT to your ear !! it wake MY HUSBAND & I up , it be so loud we scream ! you think we WOULD LEARN the 1st TIME WE try a different nature sound -lrb- think it be just that SONG recording -rrb- the NEXT NIGHT & IT happen again . both TIMES IT DOES not happen for about 30 minute to a hour , SO BY THEN WE be sleep ! REALLY THIS be the perfect clock if it do not have this issue . I do not KNOW HOW THIS get OUT on the market ! HOW DID IT pass inspection !
AlarmClock	NEG	1	very disappointing - the light do not light up the number well enough to read they in the dark . this will get return . I guess I need to keep shopping for something you can see at night time , this certainly be not it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock be even more than I expect it to be . it be fully electric with a battery backup . the 3 type of wakeup sound be crystal clear and very interesting . Timex 's reputation be even higher in my mind now that I own this clock .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock work fine , but the alarm be not loud enough for the elderly relative I purchase it for . if you need a clock for some one hard of hearing , search for the `` sonic boom '' brand , it be what we end up purchase to replace this .
AlarmClock	POS	4	small cube when you clap turn on it s a baterry saver very clean like it so far so good classic
AlarmClock	NEG	1	a horrible , useless clock . there be no light , so you can not read the damn thing when you wake in the middle of the night , and the cheap plastic frame break the first time I use it . I would return it for a refund , but for ten buck , I 'll just toss it and post this review . do not waste you money . if I be Elgin , I would be ashamed . I certainly will buy any Elgin product after be rip off like this .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a great portable travel clock - exactly what i want . this clock be compact and easy to throw in my pocketbook . it be easy to read the time , very simple to set the time\/alarm and be inexpensive . I be look for a small travel clock without any fancy feature and I find it - I would definitely buy it again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have be oversleep on workday for the first time in my life - sleep through alarm . now no more worry . this really do work , and I find it very cute too . the sound be adjustable both in quality and volume - and the shaker really work . I be very grateful . it be easy to set both the time and the alarm . one reviewer complain about the brightness - and the number be bright during the night and change color , but I like it . be just hope that I do not annoy my neighbor , so I not set on the higher volume . this be definitely a very girly look clock . I have purchase three altogether - one for my bedroom , one for the living room set 20 minute later , and one for work - just to look pretty and keep I in touch with the time . you can can a visual alarm with a small row of light flash if you do not want the sound . I also purchase a extension cord which work fine . I be very pleased with this clock !
AlarmClock	POS	5	in case you worry that the bed shaker will not work , it do really shake\/buzz the whole -lrb- twin -rrb- bed in short annoying burst . you can choose vibrate only , vibe & alarm buzzer , buzzer only . the alarm buzzer volume & tone can be adjust a lot -lrb- all be quite annoying & guarantee to get anyone out of bed , esp if you heavy sleeper be awaken first by the bed shaker -rrb- . my daughter will not wake up with a regular alarm no matter how loud . usually I have to go in & harass the poor child , then keep go back to wake she up again ... & again . I work ; I do not have time for that ! this get she awake . the heart shape & color be very cute , & my 11 year old like the rainbow color time display . so far , she do not hate it yet . ; - -rrb- now I be look for one for boy !
AlarmClock	POS	5	as a Star Wars fanatic , this clock be fun to have and great to wake up to . it also inspire my son to wake up early .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this alarm clock be just what we be look for - easy to use and have a small footprint on we nightstand . it would easily fit in you pocket or a purse . when close , it measure just under 2 1\/2 `` w x 3 1\/2 `` l x 5\/8 `` D. it come with a `` button '' battery , rather than the more easy to replace aa or aaa battery . since we have no idea how long the battery will last , we decide to just buy a new battery and keep it on hand in the nightstand drawer . the Energizer model be 357\/303 -lrb- also #ag 13 , lr44 , exp76 -rrb- . these battery be sell at hardware store , Radio Shack , etc. .
AlarmClock	POS	4	they have change this clock since the review by dr that be currently list as most helpful . the small change be that it now use 3 aa battery instead of one c cell . the big , and good , change be that the clock now have a dimmer switch to adjust the brightness of the automatic dial light . you can adjust it from very dim to brighter than a night light . the light itself have also apparently change from earlier model ; now it be a even , overall green light dial instead of a hot spot of light . you can still also push the snooze button to get a very bright blue light . the bad part about this clock be the hand . some designer must have think they would give it some sort of `` look '' with the cut-out design of the hand instead of the functionality of a solid hand . the cut-out hand make it very difficult to see the time at night with the back-lit dial because the light come `` through '' the hand and fuzz they out . to be able to see the time require that you turn the dial light way up , which be very annoying in my opinion . fortunately it be easy to fix if you be even modestly handy . pry off the lens with a very small screwdriver at either the 6 or 12 o'clock position . Cut some black electrician 's tape with a fine scissors or x-acto blade to span the open cut-out on the hour and the minute hand and apply it . I use a tweezers to position and apply the tape , gently tamp it onto the hand to stick . the whole process take less than 5 minute and be now easy to read in day or night condition . I have upload a photo of the result .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a well make product that be go strong after month of use . my son love check the time before he get out of bed . the only `` downside '' be that the clock make a beep sound if the light to check the display be activate . I find that it be helpful that it be not consistently back light , which make the room darker and more sleep-friendly , but the `` beep '' can be annoying to those who be light sleeper like I be .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love the easiness of use of this alarm clock : no mess up with `` mode '' , `` set '' and other button to access function I 'll never use . this alarm clock have four position : time set , alarm set , alarm on and alarm off . it be everything you need , and you can not go wrong . the alarm be loud enough and it be progressive . contrary to what the description say , it require 2 aaa battery , not 1 .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	within 6 month of purchase this item , the button control the 2nd alarm mode would get stick and be difficult to set . six month later the sound stop work altogether . be a good product while it last , but for the price it should have last longer . it must be make in China .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	water get into this two day after I use it in the shower , and the clock be no longer visible .  i leave it unused for two week , and the 6 c-battery have run out .  believe it or not , I believe I actually throw my receipt away when I get it ! -lrb- that be why I be anonymous . -rrb-
AlarmClock	NEG	2	when I find this while search for a alarm clock I be really impressed . a attractive look lcd picture frame with mp3 & alarm clock for less then many regular clock , what a deal ! when I open it I be much less impressed . First off , even though I use a ruler to try to visualize the size of a 3.5 '' screen , once I open the package and place it on my nightstand it just look tiny . then I try to use and within 10 minute I decide to return it . as a picture frame that you would put on you desk at work , maybe it be not too bad . even though the screen be small , in just picture mode it be not terrible . the screen be clear & bright , and the resolution be pretty good for what it be . but as a alarm clock it be terrible . you have 3 mode to display the time : a rendering of a analog clock -lrb- that only use 1\/2 of the screen so it be microscopic -rrb- , a full month calendar mode , and a clock\/date readout with a thumbnail photo . to look at the picture show in the Amazon description they all look pretty good -lrb- magnify on my 22 '' computer monitor -rrb- . but in reality , on such a small screen you need magnify glass to read the time in any mode . then I try to set the alarm . you have to go through 2 sub-menu and scroll down through 10 different option to set it . and push the completely non-intuitive button require quite a bit of force and they make a rather loud -lrb- low quality -rrb- click sound that will wake the kid in the next room . for instance , if you want to change the time from 6:30 to 7:15 literally take a few a minute because you have to hit the button like 30 time to get into the menu and scroll down to where you set it , then once for the hour and 45 time to change the minute -lrb- hold the button down do not let you scroll through the number -rrb- . in addition , it also display the indoor temperature and even though I let it sit on the nightstand for several hour it always read 10 degree higher then the actual temperature . to sum it up : as a cheap digital frame ; good as a alarm clock ; Bad
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be pretty satisfy with the clock . it be easy to setup . I follow the instruction and change the preset time to match my current time . the digit be large and easy to read from distance .
AlarmClock	POS	4	we buy this for we 9 year old daughter as she first alarm clock . she love the vibrate feature -lrb- so far anyway - have not actually use it to wake up over the Holiday yet - just keep set it to feel the vibration ! -rrb- . the rainbow number be really cool too ! I really would have give 5 star , but I do not like the sound of the alarm ... you can adjust tone and volume on it , but to I sound a bit like a smoke alarm or something -- just not thrill with the sound . in addition , the color on the picture do not represent the actual product in my opinion . I think it be go to be hot pink and it be not -- not sure how to describe this particular pink . otherwise , we be very happy with the product !!
AlarmClock	POS	4	item work exactly as describe . it actually get the signal from Colorado very quickly once I realize I need to turn on the wave . Buttons be easily hit accidentally which can cause the clock to change to 24 hr time or turn off the signal receiver .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	junk ... can not hear alarm ... I even press it up to my ear and can not hear it ... that pretty bad ... have no loudness control ... so order another one ... same thing ... call the mfg. . . she even admit that the alarm be not very loud on this model . . not very loud i can deal with , but silent I do not think so ... 2 out of 2 defective ... not a good deal ... which be to bad ... because I really do like the big red clock face and the fact that it set itself , .
AlarmClock	POS	5	th sonic boom sbh400ss sweetheart loud plus vibrating alarm clock be super !! Wakes I up but I do have a tendancy to use the snooze alarm too much -lrb- I seem to need that extra 9 minute . -rrb- the only concern I have be that the cord for the vibrator that go under my pillow could be longer so it could reach my pillow from a further distance , therefore , I would have to get up to set the snooze alarm which would then wake I up without have to go back to bed . : -rrb-
AlarmClock	POS	5	my brother love he lego Darth Vader , when you take it out of the package he say it look like ep 3 where Anakin become Darth Vader . `` PADME !! ''
AlarmClock	POS	4	the ratchet knob on the top set the time a minute per click , so it really take a lot of work to set a time 12 hour , but it do the job . the radio be not really that great but I can get local station ok . I take the clock apart and wire it to activate a fire buzzer when the alarm go off . the only part I need be a reed relay , some wire and a switch . now I can really wake up with a serious alarm . -lrb- any day of the week -rrb-
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I be a time geek . my watch be a Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium solar power `` radio '' watch that keep accurate time to a fraction of a second . I have two `` atomic '' wall clock that stay synchronize via radio signal . I buy the Chaney as it have nice size led number and would be perfect for the entertainment center since we new dvr do not have its own clock display . however , it lose about 2 minute a month and need to be reset constantly . I email the manufacturer and they say that be `` normal '' . the clock on my wall oven and microwave be more accurate ! if you be happy with know `` about '' what time it be , this clock be fine . if you want to know the RIGHT time like I , you 'll hate it ! I be give it to my wife to use in she sewing room .
AlarmClock	POS	5	excellent clock , keep time , get I up on time and I can read it in the middle of the night without any problem .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I put these little travel alarm any where I need a reliable time keeper and have limit space available . they fit on the toothbrush holder , window sill , just about any place . and the price be right .
AlarmClock	POS	5	great !! bigger than I think . the dot : colon in the MIDDLE do NOT flash . the clock have the correct time when I plug it in . I love this product . Easy to see at night . I only want a clock so I have not use the alarm feature and be not sure f it make a good alarm . excellent night time clock !
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I buy two of these about 1 month ago . one be work fine and the other one stop work after 1 week . I try another battery but it do not help . the light no longer work and the time make clunking noise and the alarm do not sound . I be go to try to get a refund or replacement for it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	original review 2007 : what a great surprise ! I order this simply to have a clock in the bedroom that could be read in the dark without glass ... and that be exactly what I get , but much much more ! I plug this guy in and it show the correct time ! check the instruction pamphlet -lrb- actually print large enough to read ! -rrb- and find that this clock will automatically keep up with the correct time and automatically reset for change to daylight savings and back ! this be great for I because we have a lot of clock and get they all change twice a year be a real chore ... especially the one that require two button push at once or whatever . I have be buy expensive atomic clock simply to get rid of this problem , but this one be MUCH better than a atomic , where you have to diddle with get good reception and then wait while it update ... sometimes overnight ! this little guy be program for all time zone , just flip a well label switch on the back to select yours ... not a menu , a good old switch that you just have to change one time ! what a great invention ... I hope all clock will adopt this system . no worry about power outage , no problem if you be move ... just unplug it and plug it in at you new location ... it keep time while it be unplugged ! and as far as be readable in the dark , the number be so big it be almost scarey when you look at it at night ... 10 star ! I 'll get back with a update if I discover any problem or failure . update after one year of use . 1 . this clock have never fail to show the correct time and have never fail to alarm properly , even in my rural area where power blip be a norm . 2 . one reviewer say there be no way to change the time if it be wrong ... that be INCORRECT ! 3 . one reviewer can not figure how the clock know what time it be ... well obviously it be set initially in the factory ... but probably the reviewer be just joking . it be set up and maintain its setting with a small battery which be rate `` up to 5 year '' durability . 4 . another reviewer pull the battery and say this ruin he clock ... can not imagine why he would pull the battery in the first place , but I do know there be instruction for do this . do note that the clock itself be the plug-in type ... it only use the battery to power the memory\/setup chip . after a year of use , this be still my favorite clock and I get mad every time I have to change battery on my atomic clock because they be such a hassle and I pay over twice as much for they . this be the one to buy . I be look for Chaney to come out with one that can show I the outdoor temperature as well and I 'll scrap all my junky atomic .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock be a joke . they say it update with atomic clock . what they do not tell you be that it only do it every 2-3 day . so there go the whole big deal about it set itself or be accurate . if you need to replace the battery it will be day before you have the right time again . also no manual and no toll free telephone number mean I spend more on long distance call to find out why the clock be not work than what I originally pay for the clock . and the people at Equity Time USA give the word rude a whole new definition . the first customer person service person actually hang up on I because she be confuse . all and all stick with the clock you already have on you wall , I wish I would have .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the sound be just terrible and when I turn the sound up\/down , I frequently have change the station to get it tune properly . and the cd work at first ; now it do not . -lrb- the sound be not that great , either -rrb- . a total waste of money . I should use my stereo or television to wake I up .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the Insta-Set feature of these clock be a little misleading . they be not atomic clock . they do not recieve a external signal to set the clock automatically like a atomic clock . like any other digital clock these clock gain or lose a few seconds a year . they have to be set occasionally . Google `` reset equity insta-set clock '' for instruction . basically , you hold down the DST or Alarm Set button for five seconds . you can then set the hour , minute , month , day ... like other digital clock . the documentation never say specifically what Insta-Set mean . apparently be just mean the clock do not have to be reset after a power outage . it have a internal battery that hold the time until the main power come back on . other than this misleading name for the insta-set feature the clock I have work well . it be worth what it cost .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock be nice . I give it four star becuase it be smaller than we think and be overprice . I like that the beep be not too loud and it be easy to program . look really cool in my son 's lego room .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this sound machine\/duel alarm clock be a very good product and work as describe . I be afraid that the display would be too bright , but it have setting to dim it down that make it better . the unit itself be a lot smaller than expect , which be not bad . use the control be fairly easy after a few use , because the unit be very lite you may have to use two hand to make change . the 20 different sound loop be very good , and long enough not to be too noticeable when they begin again . the alarm clock work well and never have fail to wake I up yet . overall this be a good product especially for the price . I would recommend this product to anyone look for a good sound machine alarm clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I order this clock for myself as a replacement . I give mine to my niece as a gift with other travel inspire item , but only after I confirm that I coud purchase another one on Amazon . I love it . I use it every day and night both at home and on trip . it be lightweight , accurate and easy to see . and when you wake up in the middle of the night and want to know the time , the INDIGLO feature on the Timex be terrific . no need to turn on a light . the Timex require one aaa battery . the battery should last a long time and be easily accessible for replacement . the Timex base fold over the screen and be perfect for travel . I not only would order the Timex Indiglo Travel Alarm again , I already have . J.C. Sterne
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have try several travel alarm clock . the Westclox Travelmate be the only one I will use from now on . it be easy to use and easy to take on trip . I like it so much that I use it nightly at home too .
AlarmClock	POS	4	just buy this very same travel clock for $ 6.75 plus tax at my local hardware store . have not try it yet ... hence only 4 star .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I get this  Coby 3.5-Inch Digital Photo Frame with Alarm clock dp356blk  on the surface it look like a great buy because , for such a inexpensive item , it pack a lot of attractive function . namely , it can be use as : - Digital photo frame with a 3.5 '' panel at 320x240 resolution - alarm clock with digital and analog display - mp3 player upon testing this unit , however , I start to see some of its problem : - the setup process be rather clunky and at time counter-intuitive . for example , you often need to press LEFT\/RIGHT button for the menu to move up\/down - to perform any simple task often require push button dozen of time . for example , just to change the music volume you need to first go up to to-level menu , then go down to ` setting '' , and then `` System setup '' , follow by another dozen of key press to finally arrive at `` volume '' - the unit have no internal battery . that mean it must remain plug in and can not be pass around like other photo frame . fortunately , the clock and internal setting be not lose when I unplug the unit -lrb- otherwise I would go crazy if I need to reset the clock every time -rrb- - it have no internal memory for photo . that mean you have to insert a sd\/sdhc card -lrb- which stick out like a sore thumb from the back -rrb- - if you have both photo file and music file on the sd card , it automatically play the music file while in slideshow mode . the only way around it be to set the music volume to ' 0 ' . - the 3.5 '' display be really too small for use as a photo frame , as it be just 1\/4 the area of a print 4x6 photo . even when use as a alarm clock , the number can hardly be see from across the room . the most serious problem with this photo frame be that : in slideshow mode , it do NOT sort photo file accord to either file name or file date . so the photo show be all jumble up , with no apparent order . after much experimentation , I finally figure out that the unit simply show file in the order they be write to the directory . so the solution be to make sure that file be write to the sd card either in alphabetical order , or accord to file date . this be obviously a very tedious process if I have to do that manually for hundred of file . fortunately , I be able to find a free utility call `` fatsorter 1.04 '' , which can automatically sort all file entry in directory into alphabetical order . after do that , the unit finally can show photo in the correct sequence . I decide to keep this unit despite of all its problem , mostly because I have invest so much time in get it to work . also the low cost make it hardly worth the trouble of return it . but right after this lesson , I order the  pandigital panimage pi8004w01b
