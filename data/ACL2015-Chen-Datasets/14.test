Gloves	POS	5	I love it !!!! havent wear they yet wait for it to warm up some then I will put they to the test ...
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be great . they fit really well . my finger can move completely freely as if they be a second skin . and they be durable . I use they for everything and highly recommend they .
Gloves	POS	5	my wife ride a scooter to work in the early morning and hate the cold air get up she sleeve . this will no longer be a problem thanks to these glove . they be well make and she say very comfortable . the gauntlet will take care of the chilly sleeve problem .
Gloves	POS	5	can not go wrong with Mechanix wear glove . I use to buy the one with the wrist strap , but not anymore . the fast fit glove slide right onto you hand and no strap to deal with . certainly a preferred method imo .
Gloves	NEG	1	I swim in the ocean and rinse my gear with fresh water afterwards . I get 4-5 year of service from my wetsuit before they need to be replace , but this glove do not last 6 month . on the plus side , my hand stay warm .
Gloves	POS	5	I be not a great swimmer but I be not bad either . I be do my daily lap and wish I could have just a little something to put more challenge into my lap . these glove be just the thing . I actually could not do my usual 25 lap . I be lucky to get 15 the first day . they really do increase the upper body strength for every muscle group . they even give you hand a work out since you have to pull so much more water with each stroke . I would tell anyone that want great look tone arm and sholder to get a pair of these and go swimming .
Gloves	POS	4	these definitely do what you would expect and be fairly comfortable -lrb- although you may have some sore shoulder the next day ; - -rrb- . I be not sure if I should get the medium or the large and wish I have go with the smaller size .
Gloves	POS	4	so the glove be nice . Comfy , good padding , well-constructed . I be a decently heavy lifter -lrb- max : 120lb dumbbell in each hand -rrb- . nothing even remotely close to some people , but I can push some weight and the glove have def save my hand . only neg thing would be the area where the finger come together seem a little deep ... its hard to explain , but the webbing area inbetween you finger can get sore because the glove be ... deep-fingered ? anyway ... id def buy they again . harbinger be the s !
Gloves	NEU	3	I have be lift free weight for the past year and decide it be finally time to try use some glove to minimize the damage the weight be do to my hand . after read through the review , I buy the Harbinger pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Gloves . while the glove themselves do the job , they seem to be bulkier than they need to be which sometimes make I feel less comfortable lift heavier weight . overall not a bad product for the money , but if you be look for something slim then I would look elsewhere .
Gloves	POS	4	I buy mine one size smaller -lrb- medium -rrb- as recommend by other reviewer . thanks for the tip ! these glove help my lap time quite a lot . I do not have big polar bear paw or large foot so I need all the help I can get , swim . they do get waterlog , of course , but they stay on and be relatively comfortable . I also use they for stand up on the bottom work out for my upper body . I really like they .
Gloves	POS	5	the product arrive in time frame describe and in great condition . the glove be of great quality , especially for the low price . they be great for everyday boxing and practice , not so much for actual hardcore combat . Great buy !
Gloves	POS	5	I to be a little sceptical . Pretty pricey for a pair of glove sight unseen . not disappoint at all . work in 30-40 degree weather with galvanized metal and hand be not only well protected but do not get cold . -lrb- not for wet work though -rrb-  two thing that really point out how tactile they be : 1 . you can open the pop top of can -lrb- soda of course -rrb- with they on . never be able to do that with any work glove before .  2 . later on , the zipper present no problem either !  I be order pair for Dad and Brothers for X-mas .
Gloves	POS	4	this glove be great for we many month of winter here in the North . I be purchase my second pair just in case I lose the first pair .  I do not want to be with out a pair these glove !!
Gloves	POS	5	I get these for my dad for father day and he swim every morning during the week , these help to get he shoulder back up to par after he surgury and make swim a total workout , def . worth the purchase
Gloves	NEG	1	I use these glove for a day , ride a snowmobile . the leather tear in multiple spot , but my hand do stay dry . I do not use these glove to the extent as I would for work at home . all in all I be pretty disappoint . cheaper glove have last I a whole season .
Gloves	POS	4	I write this review when I first get they , but one pair do not last nine month in the chlorinate pool . so I guess I will get another or maybe two to alternate. : this product be perfect for my entire swim routine : walk in the pool -lrb- push I along -rrb- , do squat against the wall -lrb- it allow good secure grip onto rail and wall -rrb- , and crawl stroke -lrb- better workout -rrb- . I give it 4 star instead of 5 because I think I would like it even better if the webbing go right to the top of the finger and enclose they ... ok , so it be now a few month later since I edit this review and the two set of these swim fin I get in May 2008 have start to seriously deteriorate with normal use . they be rip alongside the seam where they be stitch . so I be send they back to Amazon and yes I be order replacement and this will be the last time . if they fail this time , I will send they back to Amazon and I will look for another brand . I will reduce the star to 2 .
Gloves	NEU	3	in about two month they be a mess . . smelly -lrb- not my hand , leather smell -rrb- fall apart etc. . I guess its time to get a new one but i d much rather buy a pair that last . no need to buy a new pair every two month .
Gloves	POS	4	these glove have change my mind . very good dexterity . I be no longer a full time tradesman , and I can not afford to have my hand in the shape they be in when I be in the field . I do more sale then work in the field , and I have develop `` office hand '' . these glove have save I more than once when I have to go back in the field . I recently re-shingle my house and wear the glove from start to finish . no callus , no tar under the nail , and best of all I have skin on my finger tip at the end of the job . the glove do take a beating , and I do not think they would make it thru another 15 square , but they fare much better than a pair of brown jersey would have . a litte tattered and a blow seam or two , but the finger tip stay on and no hole . they be a little pricey and if they be price at around $ 12 to $ 14 , I would feel that they would be more in line with what I like to spend , but my hand be glad I make the investment . somebody who use they everyday will be go thru too many pair in a year and at the price they be now you would be spend a good bit of you hard earn cash . but price they at $ 12 buck and supplier would not be able to keep 'em in stock .
Gloves	POS	4	the Everlast pro Style Training Gloves be a decent pair of glove to train on the heavy bag with . they be ok for spar but I would prefer something with a little more padding . the only slight issue that I have with the glove be that they be a tight fit with wrap on . I use the evergel 120 '' speed wrap and it be a little hard to get the glove on . I do not have big hand I have average size hand . so if you have big hand I would try look for a different pair . overall , it be a good pair of glove for hit the heavy bag . I would just suggest to get a thicker pair of glove if you want to spar .
Gloves	NEG	1	I should have read the other review more carefully before buy !  i be a homeowner\/handyman , and I use these glove for about 9 hour of light demo before the stitching in one of the finger start to fray .  before they start disintegrate , I have no problem with the glove . they be comfortable , the grip be good , and I enjoy the good tight fit . I find they give I the dexterity to do thing that I could not do with my regular cheapo work glove . I do find myself have to take they off every once in a while for task that demand a little extra dexterity , and in those case , the wriststrap\/tight closure be kind of a hassle . but if the glove have hold together , they would have be worth the price .  however , give the way these have hold up , it be unconscionable that these item be be market as anything other than disposable ! save you money !
Gloves	POS	4	I think I get my first pair of harbinger 143 glove from Amazon nearly three year ago now . that pair last quite a long time before I decide to replace they due to wear -lrb- seam come apart -rrb- and odor -lrb- after a while , it seem like no pair of leather glove be immune to stink , even after repeat wash -rrb- . I quite like my first pair and be surprise to find some less than good review here , include comment from people about how they glove fall apart rather quickly . well , I order another pair of these only about a year ago and they be already in much worse shape than the previous pair that last twice as long , despite get the same amount of use from I . I also notice that some other reviewer mention how these glove be tighter than they should be , and that do not describe my first pair but definitely describe my second . just a few day ago , I order another replacement pair . I obviously can not say whether they will hold up better than the second pair I have , but I can report that even though the glove be ostensibly the same size the new pair be , in fact , not nearly as tight on my have as my second pair . I be a bit frustrated by the lack of consistency in what be suppose to be the same product , but I do like these glove overall . -lrb- I guess that be obvious or I would not have order another pair again ! -rrb-
Gloves	POS	5	great product , sturdy and well fitting . good padding as well . great workout glove over all
Gloves	NEG	2	I follow the size chart provide on the web page and order small , but now I can barely put they on and barely take they out -lrb- the take out be so annoying -rrb- . they will be a good present for my friend that have small hand !
Gloves	POS	5	in my job I `` do the desk '' most of the week but in the PM and on weekend I work around the house pretty hard . in the past I wear out a couple of pair of leather glove each summer . I be currently build rock wall and these glove be hold up fine against rock whose sole purpose be to chew up glove and then hand . my hand be between med and large so I order the medium size and they fit good . some of the other review mention the price be kind of high but I figure I have save a couple of buck avoid have to buy two pair of leather glove . I like they .
Gloves	POS	5	I have short wide hand . these well fitting glove allow I to work in the yard with good control of tool . the elasticity make for a geat fit , and they breath well . here in humid Florida , that be important . I be very pleased with they .
Gloves	NEG	2	these be my first boxing glove and needless to say the last glove I ever buy for less than $ 50 . I know how to wrap my hand , and I know how to punch but I injure my knuckle twice in these glove . the first time I land a left hook to the temple of my spar partner . I be out for a month . I baby that hand for 3 month then the first day i go heavy on the bag with they I re-sprain the same knuckle again . first off a boxing glove will last you about 6 month if you be a 5 + session a week fighter . it 'll be more if you be a two a week fighter and pretty much a lifetime if you do that cardio boxing stuff . reason be the more you hit the bag or you partner the more the foam break down and sweating into the foam do not help either . about this glove : size : a little too small for my hand . I be a very big guy with very big hand so unless you hand hare as big as a NBA center like mine there be no need to worry about it . lining : First thing that wear out on mine . it fall apart inside and start to irritate my finger . not a light irritation either . it make my knuckle bleed the last day i wear they . Leather & Stitching : it be good . not a single stitch pop . foam : break down after a few month . also start get lumpy towards 4 month . Beathability : they breath about as well as a plastic bag . I supprise my finger do not prune up after my training session . it make the glove hard to dry out and then they smell horrible . they also make you hand smell horrible . ceadar chip help a little bit but after training session they make my hand smell like a dirty sock . hand protection : I think they leave it out of this model . I bruise my knuckle twice . not so with other glove . velcro : so easy to put on and take off . by far the easiest out of any glove I have own . bottom line : the look nice and do the job but do not risk hurt you hand to save money . if you be do cardio boxing at LA boxing and dont really hit the bag all that hard then they might work for you . you hand will still stink buy you wont get hurt . if you be serious about the sport and think you will do it for at least 6 month do you hand a favor and buy a pair of Title gel , Ringside IMF Tech , or Grants .
Gloves	NEG	1	i use these like 3-4 time and the finger already rip out of they . not durable to any reasonable extent . a common occurrence with glove . pro series , carhartt , you name it . my cheap dewalt last longer . go to try youngstown , ninja , and sealskinz .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove fit tight to the skin while increase you grip and provide some protection . the key here be to wear the right glove for the job . if I be handle something sharp , I 'll wear something heavier than these . perhaps the only flaw be in the labeling that these be heavy utility . I have be use these as a general work glove for a year now and love the fact that I still have some `` feel '' with these . I plan on pick up the framer style for situation that require more finger dexterity .
Gloves	POS	5	what can you say !!! when my wife like something it be gotta be the best . the gauntlet keep all the wind from blow thru she wrist . the fit be true . and the price !!!! these glove be half the price of competitor . thanks Jafrum for make they available and thanks Amazon for the amazing way you do business .
Gloves	POS	5	my favorite training glove , really like the design . they fit just great . I ve be train with they about 7 month . only thing , be that you must really wash em each month because the smell like leather .
Gloves	POS	4	these be good everyday gardening glove but not up to really heavy-duty use . I be mostly look for something that would fit comfortably for casual garden chore , and these do . but for those of we with big paw , it would be nice if a larger size be offer . I do not expect these to last more than a year with sporadic gardening project . so far , so good .
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these for my husband for use in he wood shop -lrb- 1 pair -rrb- and a second pair for use when he work on the car . we have a unheated garage and minimally heated wood shop . during the winter month -lrb- in Wisconsin -rrb- it allow he hand to be warm when work !
Gloves	POS	4	I buy these glove to work on a horse and cattle ranch for a few week . the ranch have 27 horse and about 100 cattle , all need feeding every day and other care . I wear these glove for two week , all day every day , about 12 hour a day of hard work . I would say they have about 150 hour of hard labor on they . by the end , there be tare in the seam along the glove line but the rest of the glove be still hold up strong . all in all , awesome glove . if use for basic mechanic , gardening , yard work , etc. . these baby will last a long time . on a horse\/cattle ranch ? maybe two week . I be happy with the use I get out of they for the money , I do not expect they to last more then a few day .
Gloves	NEU	3	product as picture , or so I think . glove be extremely comfortable . unfortunately the stitching be substandard and with less than 20 hour of use the thumb stitch be unraveling . this aside my biggest complaint be I assume that the same padding \/ insulation picture on top of the finger would also be on the thumb . there be no padding at all on the thumb make it extremely uncomfortable to do free weight curl , because you thumb be always chaff the inside of the dumbbell .
Gloves	POS	5	I use these at the fire department . the first day i get they we have a head on collision with glass everywhere . I be able to grip the `` jaws-of-life '' very comfortably and have good protection from debris . I would recommend these glove .
Gloves	POS	4	I have be use these glove for a month and have be hope they would stretch out some . they have stretch out some over time but not enough . I read the review before I purchase they and see all of the comment about how small the glove be so I order a xxl size even though I be typically and XL . upsize the glove 1 size be not enough for I because these glove and too be still too small . they be very well build and should be very durable , the size just stink . if you be consider buy these glove you should upsize they 1 - 2 size .
Gloves	POS	5	I can not say that I have try a lot of different weightlifting glove . all I can say be that these be great . they fit snuggly and comfortably , seem like they will be very durable . wear they do not just protect you hand , it add some measure of a feel of stability as well . definitely worth it compare to the cheap pair I buy before .
Gloves	POS	5	very happy with my choice of glove . so far ... because , only time and usage will tell about they longevity ! one thing though : I order size large , and get a size large , so tight that the glove be very difficult to take off , even worse after the workout ! and I do not have big hand at all . I buy another pair , from another brand , at the same time , same size large , and they fit I perfectly .
Gloves	POS	4	this be my second pair of these glove , so obviously I be satified with the quality . the glove be great for training and for help to perfect you stroke -lrb- they make it very obvious when you be not do thing correctly -rrb- . the only reason they do not get five star be because , as other reviewer have mention , the wrist be a little loose . the velcro do not quite go over far enough to tighten they up to where I would need for they to be snug . it be a little distracting when swimming , but definitely workable .
Gloves	POS	5	day in and day out , these be the swim add on that I can not live without as I now feel as if my hand be build as they should be for swimming . after all , this be what creature from other species who be build to swim be give as part of they dna code . webbed paw , what more could I wish for in the water ? these be perfect for every swimming stroke : side stroke , crawl , breast stroke , all back stroke , underwater swimming . I do not even bother take they off for surface diving . my hand and arm be so much stronger after swim with these daily . it be the easiest thing to add into any water workout and feel part of you body from day one .
Gloves	POS	4	I get they for my boyfriend who start lift , he say they be great . they help with hand pain so he can lift heavier weight and for longer duration . for beginner , I would strongly recommend !
Gloves	POS	4	add to the workout in water aerobic . run large but well worth the cost . help with back exercise and resistence
Gloves	POS	4	I have own these glove for about a month . I have swim with they about 100 lap per week . they be comfortable and extremely functional . guess the size be really the only dilemma in purchase they . it be good to err on the side of larger than you think .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be great ! they be size small so order they large like every one else say . they be a little stiff at the web of you finger when they be new but a couple workout and they fit and feel fine . I have no problem with loss of grip do lat pull downs or pull up with these glove at all . the leather in the palm have just the right amount of thickness and be very tough but pliable . the mesh back be breathable and do not overheat you hand . I would have pay twice the price for these if I have to .
Gloves	POS	4	I love these thing ! they can turn a aerobic exercise session in the pool into a excellent resistance session . this be my second pair and I purchase they as a backup to my original because it be difficult for I to shop from my location . this pair have velcro closure -lrb- old pair do not -rrb- and the sizing be accurate . my only complaint be the stitch between the finger which make the glove into a `` web '' . the stitch go up too far and the point of the Vee that it form dig into the webbing between some of my finger -lrb- see product pix -rrb- . I be hope that this soften up with wear , but I still love these thing !
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these glove to hit the heavy bag and practice my Krav Maga when I be not use my Harbinger MMA style glove . I can not speak to the durability of these glove because I have have they a week and only use they once but they seem decent . they do the job with protection and the mesh ventiliation allow for some cooling -lrb- if that be possible with wrap -rrb- . I would recommend these glove . I like the velcro because I can use my tooth to get the second glove on . as other have mention , the only downside be the smell . holy smoke they smell like they be forge by mutant in a radioactive toxic waste dump and have the ability to easily stink up a small non-ventilated space , even when not in use . I be hope that fade over time and my better smell BO take over . put these glove on , wear you three wolf shirt to the gym , and do not be surprise when the lady start throw they phone number at you .
Gloves	POS	5	love they . Super well make , great padding -lrb- not to much or to little -rrb- and they have little tab which make take they on and off easier .
Gloves	POS	4	the glove be a little small , so I get a larger pair . the larger pair be the right size , but the finger be a little long . this make it a little discomfort when you squeeze a bar . but its minor . not a big deal , but that why I give they a 4 instead of a 5 . other than that they be nice and good quality . would recommend .
Gloves	NEG	2	I work in a freezer full of frozen food where the temp be consistantly 10 degree fahrenheit . after 20 minute with these glove on plus a polypropelyne glove liner my finger have already start get numb . the padding around the finger to keep they insulate be nonexistant . I like the dexterity and the grip from these glove . that be about it . for 49.99 though , I think the average person would be better off buy a extra large ski glove from walmart and layering that up with glove liner to keep warm during work .
Gloves	POS	5	great deal ! there not the best glove but they be very good glove . I be a very happy Buyer ! I hope other customer find this out too . : -rrb-
Gloves	NEU	3	I buy these glove because I start work out at the gym and need add protection to my hand , since I have carpal tunnel . these glove protect my palm from the pressure and I have less pain in my hand . I wish the fit be tighter around the finger , but ince I wear ring , the fit work out so I do not have to take my ring off ; and I be now wonder if I should get a glove to fit up around my wrist for add support . my hand be med-large and I have long skinny finger , so the fit be not custom make , but for now they be work out for my workout routine .
Gloves	POS	4	glove be great . they protect you skin from the weight but be light and breathable so you do not sweat a lot . solid purchase !
Gloves	POS	5	I recently return to swim regularly and have not try swim glove . the Speedo glove be great for strength training , they fit well , go on and come off easily .
Gloves	POS	4	these be great workout glove for the price . great ventilation and protection during a hard workout . the only problem I have with the glove be that it run a bit small .
Gloves	NEG	2	I read the review here and after compare to other product i decide to pull the trigger , my hand measurement be a bit under 8 in . so i assume a medium -lrb- 7-8 -rrb- would be a good fit , it be not , way too tight , the inseam between the finger be digging in the soft skin webbing between you finger , the material be way too short for my hand as it do not cover the whole palm and overall very uncomfortable , it be the natural color , which i return , though it seem like it would show dirt very easily second try i go for the large black , it should fit I very well this time , not the case , same problem with the medium still , the material be not enough to cover the palm to give you a comfortable fit , when you spread you hand open wide there be a gap of air between the glove and you palm that be always uncomfortable , and same problem with the inseam digging between my finger , the material be too tough , i decide to follow the advice of the person upload he photo to cut small slit between the finger , it have to cut slit in every inseam to feel comfortable , the pain be almost go but the finger be much shorter now . I also notice on my first workout use it that the stitching be miss in one area of the glove , but i ' v already alter the product so I can not return it now . the wrapping be very uncomfortable as well . so to sum it up ; con : 1 . way too small , not enough material to cover the entire hand , uncomfortable 2 . fabric be painfully digging int he seam between the finger 3 . you might find miss stitch 4 . the clasp be uncomfortable 5 . bad design and workmanship pro : good quality leather overall I would definitely not recommend it , I only give one star over the minimum for the leather quality but i would recommend look else where , and maybe look for a different brand as I read similar complaint to mine on other harbinger product review what would I buy if i have to do it all over ? I do a lot of research on different glove and the Schiek 530 glove seem to be a solid one . a bit pricey but a good glove can last for year
Gloves	POS	5	my hand be extremely calloused and rough before buy these glove . so much so that they even have harden area that would hurt people when I shake hand . if you be go to be lift extremely heavy weight these be the glove to buy . they have a great fit . they be snug but do not cut off circulation . I would highly recommend these glove to anyone that do weight training .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be fantastic . the excellent fit couple with the over all durablity make these gloce perfect for heavy yard work . I have be use a sigle pair for almost a year now and it be not untill i have to split and stack 8 rick of wood in a weekend untill they start to show some wear . I would seriously recommend these glove for anyone do any heavy yard work or simmilar work .
Gloves	POS	5	the fast fit glove perform very well . I just complete two hour of very detailed work with many small part , some part needle size . I be able to complete all work without remove the glove . excellent .
Gloves	POS	5	so I take the time to write a review for this wonderfull product . what can you expect from speedo ? nothing but the BEST . as soon as I use these , I feel the strain in my muscle . they really add more strength and resistance , to you upper body . you can expect a very goood intense workout !
Gloves	POS	5	very good grip around the wrist which be really important when you be train with heavy weight . Enough cushion for the palm of you hand . and the price be good too . I do recommend these .
Gloves	POS	4	basically a very good pair of glove . they work very good and be easy to strap . they do not start smell and they stay fresh . they be easy to put on and they have a little thing to keep the glove from slip but not to much to annoy you .
Gloves	NEU	3	I buy a pair of the 14 oz a couple year ago and they last for like two and a half year . then the lining start rip and they be hopelessly stinky so I buy a new pair last week . the new pair stink like chemical \* way \* worse than the other pair , the wrist be much floppier and offer no support , and the velcro be harder to fasten .
Gloves	POS	4	the Gloves look good . I be hope these glove have a little more padding , but overall I have see much less padding in most other . overall i would recommend as they also look very nice .
Gloves	POS	5	I use these glove 5 time a week . go on the 12th week now , still go strong . these glove be on point !
Gloves	POS	5	I purchase 2 pair of glove for a friend of mine and for myself . I be look for this purchase since a long time ago and take advantage of the recent low price on this item . ship be free and I be very pleased with the quality and the ease of use of the glove . they sure be thin yet strong enough to protect you hand while work . I use they to fix my car mostly . I would recommend this purchase .
Gloves	POS	5	great product for increase intensity for upper body in aquatic exercise . far superior to lycra glove I have use in the past . would recommend for anyone look for result . sign , a water fitness instructor
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these for my sister 's 20th birthday gift . she love they ! they fit great , work perfect , and be very stylish ! I could not have get anything better for she !
Gloves	NEU	3	the Haringer pro FlexClosure glove be ok at best . the size guide be not very accurate . get the glove on and off be not very easy . also , the glove cut into the finger 's webbing so it be not very comfortable . get the glove at you local Walmart would be cheap and of good quality .
Gloves	NEU	3	I read the customer review before purchase this product . everyone recommenede order one size up . instead , I order accord to the size chart on harbinger 's website . accord to the measurement , I require a medium ... which be what I order . upon receive they I find they to be surprisingly too big . they be loose , and unlike other customer , I find the finger hole to be quite big . I double check the pacakaging and tag inside the glove . they both claim m. I hate the hassle of return item , so for $ 10 ... I will probably just give they away . still a waste . they seem to be of good quality , other than be slightly scratchy on the inside due to seam .
Gloves	POS	4	I have go through 3 pair of these over the last 3 + year . that be more longevity than other I have use . these be comfortable and give I the right amount of protection . I be go to put these on my Christmas list . I be about due for a new pair . smell be a problem , but it have be with all glove I have have . just get to rinse they out more often .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be just what my husband be look for . he think they be great for he workout and very comfortable .
Gloves	POS	5	I have get to highlight these as quality glove . the leather here be soft , flexible , and properly place . the material do not shrink in the wash .
Gloves	POS	4	I be look for a pair of glove that be lightweight , and would not bunch up my finger too much . these definitely fit the bill . they be not the warmest glove , but I be expect to have a tradeoff between warmth and dexterity , and be glad to have they .
Gloves	POS	5	I have wear a pair of these glove for three winter now intermittently for construction work and they be just start to go . I have go through many pair of cheaper brand in the interim , and find that these be worth the extra money . I have also use other brand that have Kevlar stitch which work well but cost more do not hold up any better . these be the perfect combination of dexterity and warmth . they be not `` hold you hand under a faucet '' waterproof but they keep out rain and snow . I often wear another pair of insulate leather glove over these if it be really cold and remove they to grab nut and screw , etc. . I have try the rest and I be come back for my second pair of ccg .
Gloves	POS	5	yes there may be gym glove that you can get for a couple dollar less , but the quality suffer by a lot . this pair of glove be not only stylish but they serve they purpose to the best .
Gloves	POS	4	the glove be really nice and seem to have a lot better quality than the older style . my only problem be that the old style fit with XL but these be a bit more tighter . after a while my finger start to get the numb sensation . I have be wear they for 2 week now and they area around the finger have loosen up . if you do not mind the tightness at first I would get these glove . they feel good and provide pretty good flexibility . or you can get the next size up : -rrb-
Gloves	NEU	3	I work for up load truck . this glove be nice and comfortable . however they be not good for load box . the glove start to wear off by the tenth day .
Gloves	POS	4	I love these glove from Ironclad . durable and warm they be perfect for work outside in the snow and cold . my hand have stay dry and warm even when have to work in wet , icy condition reach into sump and drain . I be back to update my review on these glove . the paragraph above be write on February 15 , 2009 and today be January 24 , 2011 . I be still use these glove and find they to be very warm except when it get to bitter cold temp . once the outside air temp drop into the teens or single digit , with wind chill temp in the negative I can feel my finger start to get cold and numb if I be not actively use my hand work on something . other than that these glove still work great at keep my finger warm and toasty . I would also like to say that they be water proof to a point . I be reach into iced over gutter with water under the ice remove leaf and while my actual skin be stay dry I could tell the glove be get water log . I could take they off and ring they out so I be guess the water proof layer be the inner most layer of the glove . I also use these glove when walk my dog , remove snow off the driveway and when work outside in the cold such as on my snow blower . the textured finger tip allow I to pick up even tiny washer lay on the cement ! I be notice a lot of `` irish pendant '' or little string hang off the glove around the stitching , but that start a few month after I begin use the glove and it have not be a issue in durability yet .
Gloves	POS	4	with all thing this review be pretty much a pro and con list of thing that I have experience personally with my glove . after 2 week of 2 a day training in they I have a pretty good feel for they ability and short coming . pro : the glove itself have good hand\/finger coverage in general . the padding in the palm be thin enough for pull exercise but there be enough there to help support heavier weight when you be do a push exercise -lrb- i.e. bench press -rrb- . con : I have be a large in every other glove I have wear , I order the XL just in case they run small and find that even the XL size glove be smaller than the typical glove -lrb- they do stretch out after a day or so -rrb- . overall : I would recommend these glove . heavy lifter might want to seek out a harbinger brand with more padding . I have yet to wash they due to the fray around the wrist area and would like to get my $ value before test they washing\/drying durability .
Gloves	POS	4	these glove be comfiortable and quick dry , great for daily workout . note the thumb be attach to teh finger so pick up a water bottle to drink from during a workout be difficult .
Gloves	POS	5	I buy my second pair of glove after the 1st be steal at my local gym , and be really please with they , the only tiny niggle be the finger be a bit tight and I have to kinda pull the cut off part of the finger ending to get they off but im sure with time that will become easier as the glove mold to my hand .
Gloves	POS	4	I buy my 14 year old son 16 oz . and train with a 70 lb training bag great quality glove .
Gloves	POS	4	good product . do what it be suppose to do . only problem be that i purchase a `` medium '' since I wear a 7 glove . the glove run large and I should have choose a small . it would have be good to have size info
Gloves	NEU	3	I purchase two set of glove . I have use one set for less than 2 month and the rubber on the palm side of the glove have already develop large split . I use they for less than 25 minute per session . I find the glove useful in create resistance but would not recommend they for value receive .
Gloves	NEU	3	these glove be very comfortable and excellent for fitness in a standing position in the pool . . but overall they be extremely bad . I use they maybe 2 month and the palm on the right hand glove start crack until it finally break down completely . I order normal hard swimming pad but those be only great for swim stroke only . . im force to buy these for the fitness sadly ... I wouldnt buy THEM if you be going to DO SWIMMING LAPS with THEM Yes for the fitness and resistance part .
Gloves	POS	5	these be my first pair of workout glove , so I do not have anything else to compare they with , except for biking glove . I have be use these glove for a month and they be still work well and be comfortable , flexible , breathable and durable -lrb- and a bit thicker than biking glove -rrb- . however , some of the threading be fraying -lrb- normal wear-and-tear -rrb- . I do not have any problem with fitting ; I use the size chart on the product page to select my size . the glove webbing around the digit occasionally get tight while work out .
Gloves	NEU	3	purchase because many review have say these be better than those mechanix glove they have at home depot . I can see why many would feel that way , but I struggle to enjoy these glove at work . for one , the leather on the palm\/fingers be way too soft . I can not grip cardboard box very well with these on , and you can forget about anything make of plastic . I plan on use these to protect my finger from splinter off the terrible wooden table at work , but instead of pull shard out of my skin I have to tweeze they out of these soft glove . tl ; dr : a harder leather would have make these perfect for I .
Gloves	POS	5	these be awesome ... exactly what I be look for , I use they in my swim arobic class & work beautifully ! I can feel it work my arm so much more than without . very good price too !
Gloves	POS	5	I wear they ride my bike to work and back . I work out door and handle alot of money , they be perfect for count money , keep my hand warm and ride my bike . they be well make and strong .
Gloves	POS	5	I have have my pair for about 2 year and they be still hold up well . they dont cover up the entire finger but that be what I want . I still want to maintain some decent hand control with the equiment and these glove do the job nicely . I would recommend these to anyuone who lift weight fairly regulary or work the rig on a larger sail boat and want to protect thier hand .
Gloves	NEG	1	the inside of the right glove begin to shred within a matter of week . unfortunately it be past the return policy of the seller . needless to say I be very displeased . ------------------------------------------------------------------------- also do not order from MMA one stop shop they be not a licensed dealer so if the product be defective the manufacturer will not do anything about it . they customer service be useless .
Gloves	NEG	2	this show glove with a velcro wrist . what I recieve be two pair with zipper . the zipper be very low quality and more suit for doll clothes than athletic equipment . the zipper pull break after a few month of use and I have to sew the sipper shut . I would not recommend these cheaply make glove .
Gloves	POS	5	nice glove , good dexterity . not for very heavy work -lrb- and not make for mechanic -rrb- , but really nice for anything else . recieve on Time , would recommend seller .
Gloves	POS	4	I be skeptical of these glove when they arrive . they seem so thin . but after about one month of everyday use , I be very pleased .  I be tire of get sore hand from my generic leather glove . they seem to have lump and bump that irritate my hand . so I decide to try the Ironclad .  I have use they for all of these task : move lumber , handle and splitting firewood , handle barbwire -lrb- do not get poke in the palm , just lucky ? -rrb- , digging and just general use to protect my hand . I even wear they while use my digital camera .  the dexterity be excellent . I have be able to pick up and hold nail and screw with the glove on .  i wear the glove more because of the great dexterity . the regular leather glove have to come off to do most small task , while the Ironclad can be worn most of the time .  the glove do not so any sign of wear , so far . the only thing they do not offer be wrist protection . they be short and not good for wet work . that be why I give they four star , instead of five . but they be easy to carry in you pocket .  two day ago I be handle firewood -lrb- without the glove -rrb- and get a big splinter in my thumb . I 'll never do that again ...
Gloves	POS	5	buy for a `` guy '' gift at Christmas party . the person who get it use they and really like the fit and quality of the glove . definitely recommend as a work glove outside .
Gloves	POS	4	these be decent quality for a good price . notice they rip at the bottom a few time while pull they on .
Gloves	POS	5	these be great glove for light to medium work . I live on a large wooded lot and mother nature , especially lately , have make sure that I have to clear a lot of brush and do a lot of chain sawing , and they be perfect for pick up branch , log , etc. . they be also perfect for change the chain because they protect you hand and allow for great dexterity . I be not sure what people be do with they that wear they out , but mine show no sign of wear through . I just buy two more pair - one to keep in my car and another for non-greasy work . I have get a lot of chain see oil on the original pair and so reserve they for dirty work . another plus be that they fit tightly enough that I can wear they inside my mitten when I snow blow . they keep my hand warmer and when I have to take the mitten off to do something , I be not bare handed .
Gloves	POS	5	IRONCLAD ? what else do you need to SAY ... the ONLY GLOVES MY MEN will wear .
Gloves	POS	5	I read review and purchase this - Harbinger pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glove -lrb- Black , large -rrb- Undoubtedly this be 75 % leather and fit perfect ... another FYI ... my hand measure 7.5 , but I buy the large -lrb- coz it be kinda cheaper -rrb- and it fit perfectly ... thanks a lot ...
