GPS	POS	5	for the price , outstanding . could have buy higher price model with more `` bell & Whistles '' but for the `` average Joe '' this be perfect . I love it be mobility -lrb- internal battery -rrb- .
GPS	POS	5	I purchase this gp for my wife -lrb- ha ha -rrb- for x-ma . we have both really enjoy it . it do precisely what I expect . it be very simple , easy to use and provide all the information you need . kid love it to . it keep they busy in the car as they can see upcome street , land mark and where you be go . great !!! purchase through Amazon . outstanding customer service & shipping ! ud
GPS	POS	4	I buy this gp for a friend , and he lend I for the first week of use . it work great , help you a lot chose the exact exit lane , so the lane assist be a amazing innovation .
GPS	POS	5	this unit be nicely price and well equip . most everyone can pick it up and start use the interface with no more trouble than a ipod -lrb- parent and neighbor include -rrb- . it do not take much space in you car , but if you want to remove from the vehicle often , the Nuvi 's be thinner with bigger screen , but cost more . this be a fantastic navigational aid on trip . do not buy it if you want to go off road or into deep wood , but everyone else will love it .
GPS	POS	4	this unit be a great handheld gp . very rugged . the best feature be the software 's ability to interface with google earth on the computer , and the optional bird eye satellite imaging you can download to the GPS unit -lrb- available from garmin for about 30 buck -rrb- a year . the removable micro sd card allow you to setup and store different map and waypoint for different area on different card . look forward to try out the geocach feature this weekend ! I give it a 4 star review because the product description provide by the Amazon and Garmin website to make a informed decision on which GPS unit would suit my need be mislead . the unit come equip with `` build in base map '' that do not show one road or geographical datum within 10 mile of my home . no information on the base map except freeway and highway . do not include any surface street in my area , so buyer beware . the way i choose to get accurate road and trail information be by purchase the garmin topo map for a additional fee . this map include surface street and some trail information . it do include dirt road . these map only cover certain geographical area , like southern , north eastern and western state . the map be very detailed , include information on my local off road vehicle area . you may have to purchase more than one map set depend on where you be plan to go . the memory card that come with the unit -lrb- 1 gig -rrb- will not hold all the map datum from the topo map I purchase , you either must select smaller area where you will be travel and download to the gp or purchase a larger datum card . I would purchase this unit again !
GPS	POS	5	this unit preform flawlessly and with the free lifetime map the unit pay for itself in two year . I love it and recommend it to all .
GPS	POS	5	have a earlier model and now love the lifetime map and traffic . Easy to update , even with my MAC . traffic function work and there be a lot of information that be easy to read on the screen .
GPS	POS	5	this be a terrific navigation system , and so easy to use ! my husband and I both purchase for we car and we no longer have to worry about direction again ! I have not have any problem with the system not find a street address like I experience with other model in the past . I would definitely recommend to anyone that be shop for a gp .
GPS	POS	4	I buy this device to help I pace my run . it do a decent job at it when it can get the necessary signal . unfortunately , it lose signal pretty often . I be look at the output of the run log program , and it show that I reach a run speed of 20 mile a hour at one point . well , I can hardly get up to that speed on a bike . the error be obviously cause by the lose of signal . because of this , the device be good but not great .
GPS	NEG	1	if you wonder why the 340 cost more than the 350 , read the review . this be the DumDum TomTom . the menu be simplify for you convenience and if that be not you idea of a good thing , you should move on . I do not really have a problem with that . what I have a problem with be TomTom break the unit \* after \* I buy it ! I buy this unit because it would read street name . I get it home , do all the update , and figure out which voice I need to use to have the street name announce . then I go for a drive to test the unit , and the street name be not announce . I check to make sure I have the right voice work and even seek out more major street , think that it might not be able to recognize the smaller street . finally , I go home and check out the support forum . turn out that the latest update of the device software break the street name if the volume be set above 80 or 85 % . the volume at 80 % be not enough to hear the unit over freeway noise and moderate radio volume . TomTom acknowledge that they latest update break the street name and say they will fix it `` in a future update . '' great ! nothing like remotely render you product defective . I 'll wait about a week for a software fix and then return the item . if you would like to avoid the hassle , avoid the product .
GPS	POS	5	Sweet GPS . I have go to multiple big city that I have never be to and get right where I want to go the first time every time . great great product .
GPS	NEG	2	this gp be nicely set up and isnt too hard to operate . the bad side be that there be no website support for the US and it have a tracking problem . this could have be the one I have , but when you stop , gp keep flip you position around as if you be rotate in a circle . when you take off it have to reacquire you position . this be a problem if you be in a area with a lot of street where direction happen often . I would recommend get another gp from another company .
GPS	POS	5	I just get to use it , and it work great . the screen could be a little brighter in the shade .
GPS	POS	5	it be very useful for I because i have lose the original ... it make the same effect ... cheap and now i can use the gp normally
GPS	POS	5	this be my first gp . I have no desire to see any other . I have do the due diligence and research before decide to purchase the Garmin 1300 with lifetime map update . it be the easiest device to use and have find it very reliable get I to my destination . Garmin could do a better marketing job to let customer know what include with the purchase . I be thrill I have purchase the `` best '' product on the market . I never feel like I do not know where I be go ! good product at a good price . Voice feature be loud and clear enough to understand even with music playing at a pretty high volume ... overall could not be happier with my NUVI Charging be the issue i encounter on a road trip . if Nuvi be in direct sunlight it wont charge and the battery drain . still not a problem . if on a long trip in the sun turn it off for a spell to save the life of battery .
GPS	NEG	1	it do not work . I try several time , each time it keep say acquire satellite for about ten minute -lrb- I be outdoor -rrb- . give up . return it .
GPS	POS	5	I receive my Garmin 350 last night and could not wait to try it out . I take a road trip over to Manassas , VA , about 15 mile away and it get I to where I want to go without a hitch . Ok , so it add a turn that I would not have take , since I know where I be go , but that be no big deal . it get I there and the voice direction be great ! it give you plenty of advanced warning as to what lane you should be in for the next turn . after I arrive in Manassas , I select a shopping mall over in Woodbridge , VA and it take I over there , once again , without a hitch . this morning I use it on the way to work , just to see how it would route I . I work at the Pentagon and live about 29 mile south . the Garmin do not miss a beat , until I get to the road that lead in to the south parking area . it be go to route I around the block to get into south parking , but I know a shorter route and take it . either way , it be no big deal , because the Garmin would have get I to the same location about 45 seconds later . if I have be in a strange place , I would not have be the wiser . I be truly impress with this gp and I be sure I 'll get a lot of use out of it .
GPS	POS	5	this be such a awesome tool and it even work overseas !!! I have track a few mile on it and it work like a champ . i buy the nike + a while back and it be not cut it not enough information and i lose the watch part of it . the 110 have a heart rate monitor and it track you complete run from speed , heart rate , distance , and elevation . this be the tool you need to improve you game !!!
GPS	NEG	1	while this unit be well-priced and be outfit with all the great feature -lrb- include voice command , Bluetooth , HD traffic , smart route , etc -rrb- , it have a clumsy interface , and much more importantly , it can not find or hold on to a gp signal . I read every technical forum , try every software update and fix , and nothing could make this thing work . after read online , it seem like hundred of other have have the exact same problem with the GO LIVE line . Bells and whistle aside , a gp be not worth anything if it can not locate you on a map ... return , and now stick with Garmin .
GPS	POS	5	this be a great unit . I purchase the TomTom go 910 because it be preload with map of North America and Europe . I be in Europe more than the USA so I want a unit that could get I around all the european country seamlessly . many unit require that you switch european map between country , but not this unit . I can report that the unit work perfectly . I recently drive from Lyon , France to Torino , Italy and then to Cameri , Italy . the unit work fast to define the best route and get I to my destination without any error . in fact , in Torino I go to a friend 's apartment follow the direction exactly . when the unit say `` you arrive at you destination '' stop the car among large building downtown and phone my friend to see if he know where I be . he look out he apartment from the fifth floor and wave to I ! the unit place I directly in front of he apartment . and yes , it never lose signal even when on the narrow road bury between tall building . I also notice that in the small town of Cameri , Italy it know every small road in town . it be also interesting to note that the unit track you approximate location even when go thru tunnel -lrb- I have no signal but it apparently assume you be still go the same speed -rrb- . but after a few minute in the long tunnel it stop and wait for you exit and then refresh in about a minute . here be what I really like : \* it be very accurate and calculate route very quickly . if you make a wrong turn , it recalculate in second and get you back on the right track . \* Preloaded map of Europe , and they be accurate . \* alert you if the speed limit drop and you be go too fast . in fact , I be watch it change as I pass speed limit sign -lrb- in Europe -rrb- , and the go910 change within foot of pass the sign -lrb- how do they do that ? -rrb- . \* alert you to speed camera -lrb- in Europe -rrb- . \* have a remote control that be very handy . with the touch of a button , you can have it repeat its last instruction or tell you the next instruction . also can change volume and access all the other feature . \* signal strength be very good . I pick up nearly full signal when dock in my house , apartment -lrb- in Europe -rrb- or office . of course , I have great signal strength in the car , even though I have one of those GM car with the metallic coating in the windshield -lrb- my old Garmin GPS III unit would not work well thru the windshield -rrb- . \* Long battery life , more than six hour . \* Speaker and sound be very clear . \* when you plan you route , it provide a estimate of arrival time . I find on a six hour trip it be within three minute . here be what I do not like : \* the screen be hard to see in really bright sunlight and you be wear sunglass . lift off you glass help , but it be still tough to read . \* the windshield mount work fine , but the power connection from the mount to the unit be not work -lrb- the unit run out of battery after about six hour -rrb- . \* do not come with a carry case . sure it have a little case for the main unit , but if you drop it there will be little protection from a hard floor .
GPS	POS	4	I be pleasently surprise after use this unit . I read some horror story from some reviewer after I have already orderd it and even think about cancel . all you have to do be read the manual -lrb- which be short and concise -rrb- before you start and you should have absoloutly no problem . I read some review which complain of shoddy construction . not true ! the map that ship with the unit be work great although they be ship the newest map to I for free . for anyone that do any travel in Europe , this gp come pre-loaded with all of the european map as well as Canada and the US .
GPS	NEU	3	I have this unit for about a week , and the gp functionality work great . my main complaint be the connectivity . it come with a rs232 serial cable , which be ancient . if you want to use this with a Mac , or a pc without this connector , a $ 20 adapter be necessary . with that in mind , you might as well spend a extra $ 35 and get the eTrex Venture HC . it have a high sensitivity chip , usb connectivity , color screen , 3 x memory , geocach mode , etc. . Garmin be brilliant in differentiate they product just enough that make you want to spend $ 35 for the next model up . in my opinion , they purposely cripple the connectivity on this to make the more expensive model within reach . rs232 serial be ancient , and I do not believe it be any cheaper for Garmin to produce this unit with rs232 over the 12 year old standard mini usb connector . it be they prerogative to sell what they want at the price point of they choosing , but I would not recommend this unit . pony up $ 35 more and get the Venture HC .
GPS	NEU	3	welcome to knock-off city . when the case arrive , it smell like a combination of a tire lot and smolder plastic . then have to use scissors to trim the excess fabric in order for the zipper to close properly . it be cheap and with a few adjustment , you can make it work .
GPS	POS	5	I be worry about my Garmin GPS screen get scratch when not in use . I find this case on Amazon and think it might be just the thing I need . I fall in love with it . now the screen be protect and no one can see it in my car . great product for those large screen .
GPS	POS	5	this be the 2nd gp we have buy . out of the box we just love it . so many POI , very easy to use , you do not even have to read the manual . love the WIFI , seem to work pretty good . I have some problem get it to sign on but still a nice feature . the one thing I really like about it be the next turn be on display , and that really help . the 2nd best feature be once you reach you destination the gp do not keep try to send you back to you location when you leave . for the price of $ 120 , buy it !
GPS	NEG	2	while this product say it fit 4.3 '' gp device - they do not tell you that if you device have any connective add-on for cabling -lrb- e.g. garmin -rrb- the additional piece do NOT fit in this case which be ` glove tight ' for the basic device . if you just have a 4.3 '' device this product will be fine .
GPS	POS	5	this be we first gp and we love it . it do exactly what we want it to do which be get we from Ohio to South Carolina for we vacation without get we lose , send we way out in the middle of nowhere , etc. . we have have a lot of issue with use mapquest , phone GPS , etc in the past so we be concern about it get we lose in the mountain or send we to some tiny town in the middle of nowhere like last year with a borrow gp . we fully charge it before we leave and it hold the charge for 5 hour of constant use . we be not able to get it to charge or turn on by use the cigarette adapter , but we have a ac\/dc adapter in the car for my laptop so we just plug in into that and it charge just fine . the times\/miles be pretty accurate though it do seem to have a lag time if you change from the pre-planned route . I be sure there be other gp ' out there that offer a lot more bell and whistle , but this be perfect for someone who just want a basic gp with a simple interface . I also like that we do not have to buy new map and update like I have hear friend have to do . it do take about 90 minute for I to do the first update from the computer , but that be no big deal . I be look forward to use this on more trip .
GPS	POS	5	I be very interested when I learn that there be product that allow the integration of a street map atla with a gp and laptop computer . sound like a excellent tool for travel . after explore a number of option on the web , it appear that the Delorme Earthmate with Street Atlas USA be the way to go , although I read as many bad review as good . the price be certainly reasonable and I decide , why not ? I must say that after two day of see what this thing can do , I be truly impressed . the Street Atlas be a breeze to set up and I love the feature that allow you to copy region to the hard drive , so this thing will run san CD . the include Earthmate GPS amaze I for its diminutive size and good construction , as I appreciate the inclusion of the rubber foot and rubber strip around the unit . within 5 minute the GPS have initialize and I become a green dot on the map show my neighborhood . I immediately jump into the car and wathch my progress on the screen as a friend drive I around town . the accuracy amaze I . then I get serious to see what this unit could do . if I have to make a negative comment , it would have to be the lack of instructional material . two -lrb- tiny -rrb- booklet come in the package that do little more than explain the setup . there be a tutorial build into the program , but it do not have the same functionality as a reference manual . however , if the lack of documentation be help to keep this package at this steal of a price , then I be all for it . after three-and-a-half hour of playing , I have a good handle on all of the feature of the software and be ready to plan my first trip . there be a great deal of information available on these map , include restaurant and lodging and service available off the various exit on the highway . you can enter the name of a restaurant , and Street Atlas will locate it for you on the map . you can then take the laptop\/gps combo in the car , and it will give you real time verbal instuction as you be drive . Pretty cool ! some of the `` point of interest '' be not in the right spot on the map , and some be long go , but I can not fault the software for not know that the pizza place at the shore go out of business six month ago . all in all , it be a package that appear to do what it be design to do . whether or not it be practical in the long run to have all this equipment run in the car -lrb- you can swap the laptop for a smaller device -rrb- have yet to be determine , but my first impression be actually beyond my expectation .
GPS	NEG	1	I purchase this in Sept 2011 . work ok to begin with . then it start freezing up , but I could cut it off and it would get ok . on 2\/23\/2012 , it freeze up again while down town Detroit and I try to get out of that city . this be just a piece of junk . it be still freeze up and I will probably purchase some other type of GPS . I would not reccomend anyone waste they money on a GARMIN .
GPS	POS	5	this be my first gp watch and I could not be more pleased with it so far . the forerunner 305 feel well make and do not lose signal even when I run through wood . the best part in my opinion be be able to easily download all of the datum from you run when you get home and even overlay you path over Google map and Earth use free 3rd party tool . it would be nice if the watch be smaller , but it be light enough . other than that I would not change a thing .
GPS	POS	5	I get this from amazon for $ 450 . it be worth every penny ! I have use it daily since I just move to Tampa - it be a pretty big city but I get around without any problem thanks to the Nuvi !
GPS	POS	4	first , as everybody have comment . . the display on this 3790t look AMAZING ! compare it to ANY other gp and the difference be almost like black and white tv in 1956 to today 's hdtv ! the Display not only look good it be very use-able in any light . . even direct sunshine hit it be screen . I have a top of the line Magellan ... you can barely see the screen when it get very bright out . anyway , I would rather talk about a few quirk or negative as I feel a review should help one decide if the pro of a device out weigh any negative . my first major con be that I have only see the Juntion View screen pop up maybe 3 time in over almost 2 week of drive . I live in NY and there be a ton of Juntions I have pass thru . the 3790t doe show lane assist -lrb- the arrow which lane to be in for upcome turn -rrb- BUT it simply almost never show a juntion view . I actually return my first unit think it be simply defective . . it be NOT . so from my experience you be barely go to see juntion view on this unit at least in NY . I have read other review that state they see a lot of juntion view . . but in NY unless I have a second defective unit ? ... you can almost forget the fact the 3790t have juntion View . as a side note my Magellan show a juntion type view at 1,000 time to one vs this unit . my second con . . be more about refinement . this darn gp be roughly $ 400 depend on the deal you get . the voice inside my unit sometimes though rarely , will crack . meaning . . if a map be zoom in or or out I have notice the voice break up . this have only happen 2 time in 2 week . . but in a $ 400 unit this be unacceptable . another con for I be my first unit freeze up the minute I decide to NOT follow the gp 's route as I know a shorter way to go . I have to re boot it . . all be well but again ... refine ? $ 400 no ! my last and maybe biggest con be traffic ??? what ?? this Garmin be tell I there be a ton of traffic on my route YET my radio 's traffic report be not mention any traffic where the Garmin be tell I it be . also the Garmin be auto re route I off my route because it think there be a ton of traffic come up . well . . I do not listen to the Garmin , and there be no traffic where it say it be . on the other hand . . one time the 3790t tell I all road be clear . . while I be sit in traffic , barely move 10mph on 55 mph road . so it have be my experience that the traffic feature be near useless . or at least maybe it be a hour or 2 behind reality . that be say my Magellan 's traffic feature be just as useless . so after all this complain why do I still give it 4 star ? well . . overall I actually love this unit . overall it pick excellent route , I like the timing of the voice tell I where next to turn . . it be very difficult to miss a turn with the 3790t . . it be excellent at guidance . I choose a female New Zealand voice -lrb- build in -rrb- and it be very refreshing to be able to change voice ... as one voice can get monotonous after you own a gp for a long while . I love the size of the unit . . more than as a toy . . it be so pocket able a huge plus over the other dinosaur gp unit out there now . battery life seem good and overall construction seem high end . . except I get a little creeky sound on the small plastic part on the back if I press on it , that also house the speaker . the voice quality be awesome blow away the Magellans . . -lrb- I do not know TomTom -rrb- . . and it be loud as you can stand . Voice command -lrb- you speak to the unit -rrb- be near excellent though you may need speak rather loudly or it may just stare at you . : -rrb- I do love you can even use you voice to choose you custom favorite . however you only get 5 favorite at a time to choose from . if you do not see the one you want . . you have to say DOWN . . it will scroll down another 5 and another 5 -lrb- or it be 4 at a time -rrb- do not recall . eventually you see you favorite . . choose the NUMBER next to it . . and bam , all by voice you can start navigate . I wish you could say the name of you favorite -lrb- as in speech to text -rrb- ... say you name you favorite Mike 's place or whatever you have it name . instead you need scroll possibly thru 100 's of favorite till yours be find via voice . of course you can simply use the screen and type it take a second actually BUT so much for voice command then . lastly one feature common to I think all garmin which I love be within favorite you can see all the favorite near the one you just go to . my Magellan can not do that . . and be I be in sale . . this be a wonderful useful feature cause i may have a customer 2 block away from where I be and the 3790t will tell I so ... which may have skip my mind otherwise . to sum up my book -lrb- sorry -rrb- this be truly a wonderful unique great gp . . with excellent route . . which be why we buy a gp . I just initially want to point out some negative as too often review become almost like a team event . . mean I love Garmin . . or Panasonic or WHATEVER , often that cloud be objective . . I want to be objective here ... all in all quirk and all , I think this may be you favorite gp of you lifetime . . till the next model improve on he one `` somehow '' highly recommend !!
GPS	POS	5	I have to throw my experience in here after read many negative review about Garmin customer service . I first have a Garmin V Deluxe then upgrade to the 60c . I love my 60c ... I be certain there be some con , but I can not think of many right now . it would be great to have expandable memory . customer service : I have trouble with my Mapsource software cd . I get a response email within 48 hour ... and they replace my CD within the week . I have a question about function on my gp v and I get a reply again within 48 hour . two different occassion I get great support from Garmin . it may not be typical , but it do happen . back to the 60c ... I really like it . I use it while hike to keep track of the trip -lrb- odometer , time elapse , back track -rrb- I use it geocach . I use it in the car . -lrb- smaller screen but still useable -rrb- the color make it really nice and clear .
GPS	NEG	2	I just return the second Garmin 1450lmt which arrive without any user 's manual . it do have a `` Quick Start Guide '' , but this be inadequate to explain the function of the unit . Amazon try for 15 minute to contact Garmin and then give up .
GPS	NEG	2	I have own this for a few month . the first few time it work fine , good capture etc. . then after a few week , the on\/off system fail like many other reviewer have state . I like the compact size , however the build quality be a little weak for constant outdoor use . the main problem be the on\/off switch , it simply be not dependable . also do anyone know be I can download the firmware ? any hint on the reset switch ? it also do not seem to work well .
GPS	POS	5	1 . script : Easy Consumer Friendly internet order !!!!! 2 . Service : customer support Pleasant Professional , Helpful , and courteous !!!!! 3 . Super : Price and quality of Product !!!!! 4 . surprise : none !!!!!!! 5 . shipping : prompt and on time !!!!! 6 . security : very secure site !!! -lcb- Bonus Star -rcb- !! deserve a `` Atta Boy '' award for outstanding business !!!!! thanks for a great experience !!!! the sutton
GPS	POS	5	purchase the c330 , and it arrive the day before we trip to so . Florida to visit the grandkid . it only get lose once in Alabama on SR-76 , but I believe that problem have be correct in the software upgrade that be free from the Garmin site . the product be better than I think , and be perfect . visibility be just fine in bright daylight , and it be a Godsend at night . every little twist in the road appear on the screen . it switch automatically to nighttime mode , and back to day operation . Worth every penny !
GPS	NEU	3	this should be my 3rd waterproof camera , so why should ? because I be return it due a lot of minor issue and bad material quality . I have a Lumix ts-2 and another Lumix ts-3 , now I try this Nikon aw-100 think about have a CMOS camera instead a CCD camera but I could not believe that this camera be so sensitive . in just one week in my pocket chare with my hotel card the lcd cover be totally damage by the plastic card . also the camera be not more sensitive than the CCD as they promise here be a difference but you can not feel it . the image quality be good , but the configuration menu be quite hard to understand . I be go to buy another Lumix .
GPS	NEU	3	some bad point : 1 . -rrb- the manual for the Magellan Road Mate 3030 4.7-inch portable GPS Navigator be hardly a manual at all . it lack basic simple instruction on how to use it . whoever be in charge of documentation should grab one of the Garmin or Motorola manual and learn how manual should be write . for the price one pay for these unit , Magellan should be able to afford to hire a better writer . 2 . -rrb- the unit lack a save function\/button after correction be make en-route during trip which have be incorrectly plot by the map system in the first place . it refuse to accept correction and keep reroute one via u-turn . later trip use the same start point and destination provide route with the same error . 3 . -rrb- the unit when purchase have NAV map , as show in the product description , and when that same product description be visit one week later the map be change to tele-atla . I be wonder whether it be legal for a company to switch the map system without notify consumer . 4 . -rrb- Magellan Road-Mates restrict registration of they unit to Windows Explorer browser and doe not allow you to register if one want to use other browser . and some good : 1 . -rrb- the screen be large and very clear . there be a variety of customization option like navigation and map settings\/preferences , auto-setting , and nice keyboard layout . 2 . -rrb- the speech be relatively clear when the volume be increase , although it suffer severely at time in pronunciation of certain letter and combination of letter . 3 . -rrb- Advance warning of upcome turn be well place and quick although call the bend on the SAME road should be eliminate . they confuse one about upcome actual turn . a bend in a road be not a turn , and cause the driver to look for a upcome turn \* off \* of the current road , which be what a turn mean . 4 . -rrb- I be give this unit a b - grade .
GPS	NEU	3	the graphic on this device be much sharper and color much better than previous version I have own -lrb- Nuvi 660 be the last -rrb- . that make the display interface more invite although the map display seem pretty much the same -lrb- albeit better resolution -rrb- . the voice pronunciation be significantly improve over previous model . it be more fluid and street be pronounced much better . the fact that it can be use in `` portrait '' mode be great ... I like see further ahead on my route when I want to . I also love the customization of the display info on the map to include thing like mileage remain or altitude or time remain or time to turn or direction etc. . all these thing be much better than previous model ... in fact a order of magnitude better . I find the voice recognition to be pretty good give the noisy environment of a car -lrb- turn off you radio when you talk and it work even better ! -rrb- . however , the number of command control by voice be very limited . you can not pan and zoom use voice and you can not switch to the `` datum '' screen from the map -lrb- but you can go the other way -rrb- . they should make a lot more of the command available by voice but just zoom in\/out would be a major major improvement for `` hand free '' use . the major disappointment for I be in the route . I drive from Houston to San Antonio and back four time a month . it be 200 mile each way of which 189 mile be on Interstate 10 . I have one stoplight each way . my nuvus 660 -lrb- and daughter 270w -rrb- both route I along i-10 for 189 mile . unfortunately , this device have I exit off the highway at one exit and get right back on after go through the intersection . this make absolutely no sense . I estimate there be 30 instance of this . I have try change the preference for route and that help some but it still want I to get off . I think that for some reason it want I to take us90 rather than i-10 but clearly that would be foolish . also , leave home , it send I six block up , one block over and five block back to get on the highway so you drive right past the very street it put you back on later -- and it even recognize they be interconnect . it also can not direct I to my home but admittedly it be hard to get to my place because it be right next to a huge urban interchange and the road be hard to map . nevertheless , you buy a gp for route and this do a very poor job . I can not recommend the traffic reporting . it do not see any of the traffic directly in front of I but it do for accident 70 or 100 mile out . not very useful . also , the killer for this be that I pay a huge amount of money for this device but apparently they insist on sell advertising on the traffic display -lrb- how much do they make ? one or two cent ?? -rrb- . this be suppose to show the sign above the highway interchange but it only do it once . since then , no joy ... it tell you about the route but it do not show the sign . the display of 3-d building be fun and surprisingly accurate but not very dense even in Houston . therefore it do not really help navigate by provide visual clue on the route . they have come a long way with the device but , unfortunately , the route problem be significant . in the end , that make it , at best , a `` 3 '' for I . of course , you may have a better experience living in another part of the country .
GPS	NEG	1	I buy this navigation system 3 month ago because I do not want to pay close to the same price to update my Garmin map , but I now realize that be a mistake . the Garmin I buy over two year ago still surpass the technology of the TomTom . the quality of the graphic on the TomTom be significantly inferior . TomTom -lrb- with up-to-date map -rrb- can not find neither of my parent ' house -lrb- grant , one live in a newly establish neighborhood but be still over a year old , while the other life in a older neighborhood and street -- over 10 year old -rrb- . additionally , when the address be consider `` valid '' , TomTom announce you have arrive once you be in the vacinity of you destination . at this point , you have to look around -lrb- either to the left or right because it do not indicate that either -rrb- for the exact location . another feature I like from my old Garmin be that it tell I which street -lrb- and direction -rrb- to turn on , so when you have street close together , you be sure to turn on the right one . with TomTom , I have often turn on the wrong street and one time , it even have I go through a parking lot to get to a main road . finally , once I reach either of my parent 's house , it would have be nice to add `` current location '' to my favorite , but that be not a option -lrb- at least that I find -rrb- . to end on a positive note , I do love the screen and the information it display -lrb- outside of the graphic -rrb- .
GPS	POS	5	Great GPS . my old Garmin be four year old and miss the charger . the suction cup keep fall off of it . I purchase this one for a trip to South Florida . it work like a charm . great investment for someone who travel . it be idiot proof !
GPS	POS	5	do a great job protect my Garmin Nuvi . it be compact size make it a perfect addition to any glovebox or purse .
GPS	POS	4	. . be that the heartrate appear in very small font at the right corner which make it impossible to read when run . there be no disply option that I have find that would allow I to look at the heartrate in a bigger font screen center . I think they try to fix this in a later model . bummer ! overall , I like this product .
GPS	POS	5	receive promptly and item be package well . great to do business with . thank you .
GPS	NEU	3	I like my garmin Etrex Vista . it be easy to use , seem sturdy and reliable .  major disadvantage : 1 -rrb- the only way to connect this unit to a computer be via a rs232 interface -lrb- old technology -rrb- . I purchase a non-garmin usb-rs232 converter cable but have not be able to make it work ; 2 -rrb- there be no way to connect the unit to a 110 volt source -lrb- read battery -rrb- . I jury rig this by purchase a cable that connect the unit to a car cigarette lighter -lrb- also have a rs232 connection -rrb- and purchase a converter -lrb- $ 5.96 -rrb- that convert 110 to 12 volt with a cigarette lighter output . it work .
GPS	POS	4	after a high recommendation we purchase the Garmen 350 . it be wonderful . the kid call she `` Miss Bossy '' because she direct we every move .
GPS	POS	5	it do not always take you on the right path but it get you where you want to go . it be easy to program and easy to use . I love it and now I will not get lose look for new place to go . product ship on time and arrive in perfect condition .
GPS	POS	5	I be new to run , listen to several of my `` runner friend '' about how this watch would help I in all stage of my run , but especially as I transition to couch 25k . I buy this watch from Amazon and be SUPER happy with the watch . pro ~ \* it look like a normal watch , unlike previous bulky version and it fit a variety of wrist size . \* it appear to be heavy duty and well make , buckle be sturdy , strap be all thick , flexible rubber , be comfortable to run in , do not snag on anything while on my wrist . \* I can usually connect with a satellite within 1 minute of attempt . I run in town , have not have any interference with connect or dead spot along my run . \* it be user friendly , you may have to breeze through the user manual to figure out how to link up with the heart rate monitor and locate satellite , but if you be at all technically savvy , you can figure this out pretty simply . \* it use a handy convertible charger \ usb to charge or upload , one cord , less hassle . \* I upload to Garmin Connect website , connect to my device well , I choose upload new activity , and whah-lah , I can see a red highlight of my entire workout route each time I upload , even the day i forget to turn off the satellite and drive with my runner partner to Steak-and-Shake for they breakfast special . : -rrb- it be really awesome to see a re-playable virtual map of you run and at what point you heart rate , speed , distance . . etc. . you can view 2 separate chart , or all 3 at once that show performance on each run . if you want to link with other local runner , you can make yourself visible online , perhaps even share route ~ I have no interest in that though , so I disable that function . online software work great on my iMac . I also use the android mobile app for the Garmin Connect website , it be call `` Ga Co Mo. '' it do not show EVERY feature the Garmin website show , but it be a super nice , on the run way to refer back to you stats , calorie burn , date and activity , include modify chart and datum . the mobile app do not let you enter manual activity , like something you forget to enter that you do and remember the activity detail . but instead , you can enter that information online by enter a `` manual '' activity , then you can `` fetch new activity '' from you mobile app and you new activity will then show . \* the user profile on the watch help calculate more accurate datum , like gender , height , weight . use the heart rate monitor be the next step to personalize you run and more accurately measure calorie burn . definitely better to buy the watch with the heart rate monitor include , so much cheaper to buy it bundle !! con ~ \* the charger cord \ usb have a clip with 4 contact point to connect with the back of the watch , sometimes the watch do not charge because those contact point be not exactly line up . I may have a short in the cord too , not sure , but I have to double check each time to make sure it be charge . \* I do experience the screen lock up \ blank screen issue after 2 week of use . I follow what the Garmin web forum say to do and it work the second try . -lrb- while in Power Save Mode , press and hold the light button for 7 seconds , unit will shut off , then press and hold it again for 2 seconds and it should power back up fix the freeze issue -rrb- since then , I make sure to power off the unit after each use and it have not happen since , that be 2 month ago and no problem . ADDITIONAL : the watch be now 3 month old , just last week I notice a small crack in the PAGE \ MENU button , the next day the button must have break in half and be miss . I be work with Garmin currently on how how I can get either a replacement button , or fix , the original paper claim 1 year product warantee . because I do not buy it from Garmin or a physical store , I be a little concerned on warantee . I will post again to let you know how that go . I would definitely buy THIS PRODUCT again , it come highly recommend by MY RUNNER FRIENDS , it give me all the DATA I could possibly want !
GPS	NEG	2	the GPS unit be impressive , but mine keep drop the satellite signal and recalculate to a different destination . I try download the latest software from they site , but it do not fix the problem . Amazon be replace the unit and I will see if the new one work correctly .
GPS	POS	5	I have have my forerunner 305 for over a year and it be my favorite piece of run equipment . I stay on track with it and I use sporttrack and sync my workout to facebook which make I more accountable . if you be think about get one I would highly recommend it . I have hear some negative thing about other model but mine be still go strong after hundred of workout . it hold up well in the rain and the heart rate strap have last 10x as long as the reebok monitor I have before .
GPS	POS	5	just put this review to clear my account , I use to have this and it be great , travel many road with it . -lrb- have a Zumo 550 now -rrb-
GPS	NEG	1	boater : if you be look for a handheld GPS for marine purpose , you need to be aware that this model come out of the box with a base-loaded database that include almost nothing in the way of aid to navigation . while the older map76 model include a database of coastal navigational aid -lrb- buoy , light , nun , can , whistle , gong , lighthouse , etc -rrb- , this model do not include any of these . if you turn on this model and scroll over to Boston Harbor or San Francisco Bay , it will show you where the water be and where the land begin , but nothing more . no navigational aid whatsoever . yes , it will give you lat\/lon fix like any gp . and it will give you speed and head information . but that be it . of course , Garmin tell you that you can purchase the detailed marine chart -lrb- they cost $ 100 - $ 200 each for just a single area ... in the Northeast , you would need to purchase many of these to get complete coverage -rrb- and this be understand . but most serious boater use detailed paper chart and\/or a plotter and do not need they handheld for that kind of detail . what a handheld be good for , however , be to show where you be in relation to a bell or a light you may be run toward in the fog or in the dark or in relation to a known waypoint . the old version -lrb- map 76 -rrb- give you these bell and light . this one do not . so unless you want to add many hundred of dollar to you $ 275 - $ 300 purchase price , this be the wrong model for a handheld gp as backup . get the older map 76 instead . for less than $ 200 , you will have more than you need as a helpful boater 's unit and no need to buy electronic chart . of course , the map 76 be B&W; and not color , possibly less sensitive , and lack all the bell and whistle . but it be WAY more simple to use . this map 76csx be very complicated because it have build in all the highway , hike , climb , geocach , urban feature and capability that you will never use . just figure out the setup take hour . bottom line ... Garmin be a great product . but if you be a serious boater -lrb- not want to drop a thousand on a complicated handheld -rrb- and someopne who navigate with paper chart or a regular chart plotter , you do not want this model ... you want the map76 . many sailor just want the peace of mind from a backup . this be not it . happy sailing
GPS	POS	5	I buy the Garmin GPS for my husband for Christmas and use it on we trip to Myrtle Beach . it be wonderful not have to check map to find we way especially at night ! the voice be very calm and let we know in advance when to turn . it make for a very enjoyable trip . I highly recommend it !
GPS	POS	4	this my 2nd Garmin I have have . I like the feature that let you see ETA , mile remain , speed and elevation along with the map , all at the same time . also it it acquire the satellite signal quicker than my old Garmin 260 . dislike the time it take to update map. , about 1.5 hr .
GPS	POS	5	I use my new Garmin Nuvi 1450 a few day after I receive it on a trip from New York State to North Carolina . the screen be bright , clear and easy to use . love the voice direction that actually tell you the road or street name as you be ready to turn onto it . I would recomend it to anyone that drive .
GPS	POS	4	I use the Garmin c330 the entire weekend throw different destination at it . there be one it do not have I just put in the cross street and it find it no problem . this gp be the Apple Macintosh of GPS Units . it just work , it pick up satellite extremely fast , it be simple to use , the windshield mount be probably one of the best I have use . I have not try out the `` detour '' feature yet but it will help when I be stick in construction or in traffic . the internal battery help when try to plan trip and setup favorite while not in you car . as for it not be user replaceable I be glad it be not . do not need to be . not a serious disadvantage . if you want a gp that just work without have to worry about the other `` geeky '' feature like see the satellite and thing . the Garmin c330 be the one to get . the speaker be loud and clear I like to have my radio pretty loud and I be still able to hear the c330 . the drawback be like everyone else have say , it be not good in direct sunlight but with the voice prompt it be not a big issue .
GPS	POS	4	the Garmin c330 have a clear readable screen . the audio sound be very good . the one weakness be not its base but the clamp that be suppose to hold the unit onto the base . as soon as there be a bump or dip in the road it fall off the clamp . I have have to resort to use tape to hold it firmly . there need to be improvement of this feature . overall I like the Garmin c330 .
GPS	POS	5	this be such a nice small and cheap item , I have to order 2 of they , just to have one in each car .
GPS	POS	4	I go out of town to Las vegas and take my new Garmin with I . it work great ! I be able to find my way around town , and even into the desert . the traffic option be cool , but there be a occasional popup . but free traffic info be worth the small blurb . the search function , which I use to find hotel be a bit laggy . if you have a address , it be quick . all around a great device . this be my first Garmin . I buy a Tom Tom at a discount deal-a-day website , and be painfully disappoint . this be a great value with unlimited lifetime map . very accurate .
GPS	POS	5	I have have this gp since August 07 , I love it !! wonder why I do not buy one sooner . I like it so well I buy my parent one for Christmas . it be so easy to use right out of the box . my uncle have a Tom Tom I find it very difficult to use . the garmin be simple !!
GPS	NEG	2	this be a device for the person who like to get into the inside of the system -lrb- I believe its call hacking -rrb- . for such a person , the device be great . I would not recommend it for a novice . here 's why : 1 . the text to voice pronunciation be terrible . the word run together , for example , ` San Jose ' be pronounced sanozay , San Francisco sound like ` sunfrincisco ' . now , the interesting bit be that this issue can easily be fix by someone who can hack into the system and make a few small tweak . I wonder why TomTom can not just do be in the device they ship out , or as a software update to those already sell . 2 . this device - 540 World Traveler Edition - be pitch as have complete US , Canada , Mexico and Europe map . truth be , this gp do not have room for the newest version of these map . you can have all of North America , but not all Europe , only bit of it . for example , you can have Western Europe , but then you can not have southern Europe - because there be not room on the device to accommodate that particular map . same thing for Eastern or Central Europe . this would not be such a big deal if you could be selective about which N. AM . country map you need , so you could leave out Canada , or Mexico or US , and make room for all of Europe . but you can not do that . 3 . the worst thing be that it take age to upload map , or swap out between the regionsl european pap . we be talk hour . if I be to travel to Europe , I would therefore have to lug along my laptop and flip map back and forth every time I want to go from , say , the UK to Italy , or from Sweden to the Czech Republic . and wait around for a few hour while the GPS sit around upload the right map . I think that if TomTom do not fix the map problem within a reasonable time , I will probably send it back , since the device do not function as advertise . have say all that , once you hack it and set it up properly , it work well -lrb- except for the map problem -rrb- .
GPS	NEG	2	I buy the Garmin nuvus 1300lm 4.3-inch portable GPS navigator with lifetime map update . I have have it about a week and have only use it in area that I be familiar with . I do not want to even think about travel in a unfamiliar area with it and surely will not do that without a backup map . several time the direction could have get I into a awful situation . once I be direct onto a minor side street that would have make I miss my freeway entrance . another time I be direct onto the wrong interstate . if I have not be familiar with the proper route , no tell how much I would have have to go out of my way . other direction have be marginal . direct I to a street name , which be not post instead of a highway number that be and other thing like that . hopefully on the next update these thing will be improve . I do like some of the other feature that be not available on my old Garmin . my old Garmin be much better at give correct route , so I know they can do it . I be go to keep my new one and hope for the best . I will be travel with auxillary map though !
GPS	POS	5	I really enjoy my garmin nuvus 2360lmt . it look great in my cobalt and with purchase of eco-route hd give it even more acurate reading for economy and bonus for when you have a check engine light . I have a few bug with my nuvus when I get it because the seller sell I one that be once open register and use and then return . I work with garmin support and they get it all set up so it be not register to I with no problem . I can now update it and download stuff to it from garmin garage with ease . traffic be a great feature and be highly accurate from what I have notce . only down side I have with this device be the add but they do not pop up while drive and as often and you would imagine .
GPS	POS	5	like the first Nuvi . only have it for two week and it be steal . like the first one well enough to replace it with same model .
GPS	POS	5	order this at the same time as order a Cobra XRS 9340 . I be very please with the design & function of this device . as i see it it be a must have since the original suction cup that come with most laser\/radar warner be crap .
GPS	POS	5	I first experience a rental car Garmin which be why I buy mine - superfantastic for get around LA , travel from the mid-west to CA . so much easier and safer than look a map or write down direction . a must for big city drive and travel cross country - find hotel , gas station , coffee shop , nearby store with great ease - phone number supply so you can call to make reservation , etc. . how do I live without it ?
GPS	POS	4	I buy this unit for hike and hunting in the Rockies . like other reviewer have say there be alot to like about it . Garmin do a great job of packing 10 lb of stuff in a very small package . but , there be some negative to point out . the button and user interface software be the weakest point . because the unit be small , the button be on the side except for the `` click stick '' . I have a hard time use the `` stick '' with glove on and invariably push down when I mean to push to a side as a example . I also have a hard time press the small side button with glove on . I find some of the screen and menu option counterintuitive but learn to navigate they after several mis-step . battery usage be high . screen size be small so this probably be not a unit you want to use in a vehicle .
GPS	POS	4	I have own the garmin c530 for about a year now , and i have to say its quite nice and perform well . I use it nearly everyday as i drive for a living , it never get I lose no matter how many wrong turn i make . it have a vast amount of point of interest store in it allready with the ability to add more . it have a excellent battery life , and be also quite durable . i wil say though on the other hand its be bad when i tcomes to pick the best route . I can be on the interstate and it may want to send I down a small highway that would take 20 minute longer than just stay on the freeway . also drive time be quite accurate also . people complain that they be `` optimistic '' which its suppose to be as the gp beleive or not doesnt know how many redlight u will hit . also u can program red light camera into it so it will alert when ur comee up on one .
GPS	NEU	3	voice talk like person have marble in they mouth . many name and direction be hard to understand , could not pronounce ` county ' . some address and street could not be find . incorrectly call out road name . sometimes give wrong direction to turn . we feel that we have to have the appropriate map handy to make sure it be direct we correctly . difficult to enter some city\/road name -- after typing in a few of the letter a list would come up , if you name be not on the list , there be no way to override that list . we do not recommend this product , as we feel it be overhype .
GPS	NEG	1	this be junk , just like every piece of technology . the map do not update and it can not locate major city or street . use a compass and map , the never fail system .
GPS	POS	4	fairly easy to use out of the box . I be lucky enough to know someone that already have one . it be confuse that when you enter a address that to save it you have to hit do , if you do not you will not have the address again if you have intend on store it . you have to remember that the global positioning system be not 100 % accurate . when use it to go to a relative home I need it because it be a fairly complicated area , once there it announce the house be on the right when it be on the left . so make sure you check the address . it can be off . also if there have be recent construction it might not be update to tell you where the entrance be on a highway . the nice thing be if you take a wrong turn , the unit announce `` recalculate '' in a rather upset voice , and then give you another route . it will not necessarily give you the fastest route , but you will get there .
GPS	NEG	1	I have just purchase the new c330 StreetPilot through Amazon.com . every time I turn it on it give I message : `` can not unlock map -lrb- ok -rrb- '' . the map be not load I be get only basic map layout . I have reset the unit without result . Garmin technical support be unreachable by phone . I be tell it will take they 5 day to respond by Email . this be quite ridiculous situation . I own 3 other Garmin product and those be work fine .
GPS	POS	5	I have a gp v that I really like and this be one of the best add-on for it or any Garmin GPS .  the gp v come with the require mount bracket , and other model do too , but if not , you need to make sure you get it along with this .  this friction mount be relatively small but stay well on all dashboard I have use it on . it be pretty flat so it travel well in a suitcase or carry-on bag . it allow you to position the unit in the most appropriate spot in the vehicle and then use the clap attach to the GPS , adjust the angle of the display so it be optimal .  Detaching and re-attach the clamp unit with the friction mount could not be easier . for such a small and inexpensive add-on , I could not ask for more .
GPS	NEG	1	purchase this print server and a compatible HP printer assume it should be simple to hook up . while I be not a computer geek , I set my cable wireless modem and three other computer - all interconnect wirelessly . after download the latest firmware and installation software , I spend three hour attempt to get the print server to communicate with the printer . despite my best effort , I could only communicate to the print server via usb . print server do not even show up on the home network . assume I must have overlook a important step , I contact , via email , Netgear tech support . the extent of they support in to send the same set on instruction - it be clearly evident that one one actually read my email . follow the instruction to the letter - several time over but to no avail . I finally send a email thank they for they support but I be throw the server away and send a copy of the email trail to they ceo Pat Lo . receive another form email say how they regret when bad thing happen to they best customer and they hope to do better next time I purchase a Netgear boat anchor . after spend over six hour work on this miserable device , it do feel liberating when I toss it in the can .
GPS	POS	5	my husband and I just buy a Pontoon Boat for fishing and pleasure . we both enjoy fishing so we want to get some good equipment to go along with the boat and this unit be highly recommend . it may even be more than we need right now because it be `` load '' with all kind of good thing . the graphic be easy to read and clear . the depth finder with alarm be very helpful . even when the sun be shine on the screen , it be clear and easy to read . the sonar give a real wide angle of what be below we and in great detail . this unit have more map than we will ever use , but it be good to know they be there should we decide to hit some other fishing area . we boat dealer be kind enough to instll this unit on the boat for we and the hookup they use move it in all different direction and allow we to remove it easily before trailer the boaot home and pop it on when we be ready to hit the water . I do not see how anyone could be disappoint with this unit . my husband , who be not a `` Techie '' -lrb- have problem run a computer -rrb- have learn very quickly how to operate this unit . we love it . we highly recommend it . when I have a couple of question , support from Humminbird be excellent too !
GPS	POS	5	this be one of the best gp we have purchase so far . the info about speed limit as we drive along the interstate particularly be a great feature . thanks .
GPS	POS	4	I like the 76 that I buy several year ago so much that I want another in the same series when I upgrade . this be so much quicker , and it have so many new feature , especially greatly increase memory , and it cost considerably less than the 76S . the one thing I have find lack be that the tide feature the 76 have only come with another $ 120 + of marine software for the 76CSX . we live near salt water and it add to the usefulness when we be camp if we know what the tide be do . be there anyway I can download this into my new GPS ?
GPS	POS	5	if you buy a Garmin 60Cx , you need this to protect a great gp !
GPS	POS	5	this be a first rate geocach hand unit . I have have great success locate geocach with this fabulous gp unit . I be now able to maintain satellite signal in any location , even in my house . I recommend purchase City Navigator software to be install in this unit and this make this gp unit the total package . I give it five star for performance and user friendly control .
GPS	NEG	1	too much money for the real value that you will get back . it can take 15-20 minute to get satellite signal , intersection nor detailed like in tom-tom . I really want to re-sell it for half the price but nobody want this gp , money on the trash .
GPS	POS	5	Works great . very accurate gp . I like the soft rubber on the chest band . fit better than the Nike or Polaris I try . just wish it be a little cheaper .
GPS	POS	5	my first GPS , which I get because I would be drive in Italy , and believe I , and my rental car passenger , this turn out to be a life-saver . we would have miss a hundred turn -lrb- the round-about be especially hard to navigate by eyesight alone , as they sometimes have several exit with small or no sign that whiz by in this italian mixmaster traffic -rrb- , and some rural location , like b&b; s , be simply off the marked road . enter a town , road or street and a number , and it 'll take you there , or if it do not have one , punch in coordinate from the host . also , after read some review of other gpss , I be surprise to see how well the unit perform in city in pedestrian mode , regardless of high building , as the `` Hotfix '' feature quickly pick up any lose signal -lrb- this be true even in longish tunnel in northern Italy -rrb- . the four-hour battery be great for out-of-vehicle use . also , review for other model complain how long it take to get satellite fix and map load on arrival in the foreign country , but this gp get they up in about a minute . the Italy map be very detailed and the restaurant\/points of interest\/fuel stop nearby feature very quick and accurate . conversion from mph to KPH be simple and the many other feature be easy and intuitive , too . I be not a techie at all , but I can use this device very well . one more thing : tech service . I get help for update map because I be not very technical , and a very nice and helpful agent be on the phone with I in less than 5 minute .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin Zumo 220 GPS be simply the perfect Navi System for motorcycle on the market right now ...
GPS	POS	5	I have have this gp for almost two year and use it every day . it work exactly as it be suppose to work . I use the weighted dash holder - not the windshield mount . I also add a sd card to backup my address , but I have never have to resort to this . it be very user friendly , and everyone in the family have no trouble use it . one time I have a problem get get reception . I contact tech support and quickly receive some advice that work right away . -lrb- it turn out that dust can collect in the antenna attachment - I be tell to just pull it off , blow on the connection , and replace it . Voila - satellite connection be restore ! -rrb- other than that , I have have no problem with my unit . the only two issue that would make this gp better would be to have it smaller and to have a internal battery . however , even with these drawback , it be a great gp , and my entire family have be very happy with it .
GPS	POS	5	I be a person that will research online and at the store and this be the best gp I have see . I be about to order the Garmin c330 until I check it out at a local electronics store . the salesperson show I how simple it be to use and I pick it up quickly . when I tell he how cool this thing be and that my mind be make up on the c330 , he say `` wait , check this out '' and show I the c340 . this one actually speak the name of the street instead of left or right at the next corner . it may not seem like much , but the whole reason for buy a gp be to have you hand hold as you drive . since I do not intend to buy another , I spring for the extra $ 70 buck . this puppy be a pleasure to use . I be a field technician so this save I time and fuel when go from one place to another . its especially helpful when I be call to go someplace I have never be before and I do not need to ask direction or refer to Mapquest . I simply pull over from where ever I be , key in the address and I be off . once its save , I can always return to it . my wife have always tell I I get lose after pull out of we driveway , but never again . its size also make it convenient for when I be fly out of state and have to rent a car . you will not be disappoint .
GPS	POS	4	just get this unit yesterday with the expectation that the bluetooth `` broadcast navigation and phone call through you car stereo '' like the description say on the amazon page ... come to find out this be not true . Amazon should edit that description so nobody else will be mislead . it come out of a weak speaker build into the GPS itself and the microphone sound muffle to those on the other end of the call . . other than that , so far so good .
GPS	POS	5	I be a fan of the Hertz Magellan Neverlost system , but the bi-modal review of the Magellan Systems give the impression that there be prodcution quality issue . next , I be go to go for the Garmin 2720 . it can be fit with dead reckoning , but need wiring to the car . review make I realize , my main reason for buy a gp be not to use on my car , but on business trip and hence rental car . so portability be key , and the Nuvi have the best form factor . to lug a 2720 -lrb- with laptop , file etc -rrb- on business trip would make thing just the bit more heavy . in addition to the good point give by other reviewer , I must say the mount be excellent . it stick well and because the Nuvi be so light , the mount do not have a lot to do to stick there . also , the cigarette lighter power can cleverly be plug straight into the mount and not the unit . to mount the Nuvi , you have only to flip the antenna up -lrb- activate the gp -rrb- and clip it on . it power up straight away . then , when you get out , all you have to do , be press a small clasp release on the mount and out pop the Nuvi . it even switch itself off after 30 seconds . you can also put the Nuvi in `` search mode '' . while drive on the free way look for food or lodging , you only have to press `` where to '' and then press say `` lodging '' . the Nuvi give you a list of hotel , motel , hostel near you . it also provide distance and arrow show whether they be ahead or behind you current position . the list update itself every few minute as you move along . see something you like ? just press it and the `` go '' button and Nuvi take you there . it be a life saver when we be travel long distance late at night and need somewhere convenient to stay . finally , this be one gadget that my wife love . when on holiday , she invariably end up the navigator . its stressful for she and thing get heat up when I make a wrong turn require difficult new instruction on what to do . Nuvi have change all that . she just sleep through , as the Nuvi announce its `` recalculate '' the route . but indeed , you don `` t get a map which you can load on you pc , there be apparently no way to plan\/alter route on the Nuvi prior to make a trip or to keep a record of you trip . Garmin have be excellent in address user feedback , so I be hopeful . BTW , I do not use the other function such as mp3\/calculator and would prefer the functionality on the GPS be improve rather than these function . but that be just I since I still use a pda .
GPS	POS	5	this product work great . it be not too bulky and get great reception . the only thing be that it do not get satelite when you be indoors but that be expect unless you need drive direction from you garage to you living room . the touch screen be great and the button be large enough to touch while drive . the speakers\/voice be loud and clear . the feature be great and the poi be pretty extensive . searching for the poi take roughly a minute or two but they be good enough . you can always update you maps\/pois for free once you have register the product . overall , I really think this be a good decision .
GPS	POS	4	this be a nice unit . I especially like the large screen size and the 20 gig hard drive . I have down-load many album onto the 10 gig set aside for mp3 music and use this feature constantly on trip . use the gp require some investment in time study the manual and experiment with the different trip option that be available until it become second nature . the unit come with user friendly and efficient mount hardware . on hot sunny day it be sometimes necessary to turn on the a\/c and set it to blow through the defroster vent to cool the unit . this be no problem though since the unit will tell you when it be get too hot . I have no regret about buy Lowrance .
GPS	POS	5	buy this for my husband , and now go place be no longer a concern . we would get direction from either a person or mapquest and they might not be accurate and get lose be frustrating . this take all of the worry out of travel . I have already recommend this to my family and friend . never leave home without it .
GPS	POS	5	I be reluctant to buy a portable gp system but after much research include discussion with Garmin sale reps. I decide to take a chance on the c330 . right out of the box , this device prove to live up to the manufacturer 's representation and after be road-test in Omaha , NJ , NY and Florida , I be now convince this be , without a doubt , one of the best device -lrb- gp and otherwise -rrb- that I have ever own . thank you Garmin for make my travels safer and my life less stressful when drive .
GPS	POS	5	for several year , I have envy the owner of high end car equip with navigation system . I consider get a aftermarket in-dash system , but the price be too steep . the StreetPilot III Deluxe be just what I have be look for . it be a reliable , well-designed , and just plain fun gadget that will please the electronics junkie and the casual user alike .  the high resolution screen be gorgeous and remain clearly visible even in bright sunlight . at sundown -lrb- automatically calculate by the StreetPilot -rrb- , the display switch to black and white and can still be read easily without distract the driver . operation be very easy once you get the hang of it . the 128 mb datum card include with the deluxe version can store map cover a radius of 500 + mile . it should be adequate for almost all trip . program the card be fairly easy , although the software be probably the system 's weakest link . the interface be poorly design but functional .  the system 's autorouting function work very well , but because it can not account for traffic volume or terrain , it sometimes underestimate drive time and thus do not choose the quickest route . 95 % of the time , however , the system choose the best route , and it have identify new and better direction for several of my most common trip . the vocal prompt be excellent . a sophisticated trip computer be a include feature and be a welcome addition if you car do not have one .  I can not praise the StreetPilot highly enough . in many way , I think it be superior to a in-dash system , in term of price and portability -lrb- since you can transfer the device between car -rrb- . it be the rare gadget that be both useful and fun . you 'll wonder how you ever live without it .
GPS	POS	5	I use this to keep track of my two dog while they be off lead in the wood . it do a great job . when they go off chase whatever , you can see where they be relative to yourself and if need be you can go after they since you know the direction to take . it be very accurate at show they location . great job Garmin . my only complaint be that the track on the handheld seem to be position towards the bottom of the screen instead of the center . it give I total confidence to have they off lead so that if they get lose or hurt I will be able to find they . just a reminder , remember to re-calibrate the handheld when you change the battery . it be a very simple procedure but I forget about it and think there be something wrong with the unit . re-calibration solve the problem .
GPS	POS	4	overall this have nice feature and easy to use . have good battery life and the only thing I wish that be better be the map feature show you course . other wise I be very happy with my purchase
GPS	NEU	3	this be my third TomTom . they have all be pretty good . this latest one have a great screen . the magnetic mount be a little hard to get use to , I be not completely there yet , but it do hold the device securely . the lane assist be very good . as I say I have have 2 other TomTom 's and 1 Garmin . I prefer the TomTom over the Garmin in most category except one . the point of interest feature of the TomTom really stink . the Garmin be far superior in this respect . navigate the pous menu on the TomTom be tedious , confusing , and when you give up and decide to spell what you be look for it `` can not be find '' . I sit in front of a Kohl 's department store and search for it and TomTom could not find it . in another instance it send I to another state , by ferry boat , to a Walmart , when there be one right down the road . buy the TomTom be a no-brainer because of the lifetime map and traffic feature but I see now where other be start to offer this also . overall this be a nice device but if when travel the pous feature be important to you I can not recommend this product . if you be look for a device to simply get you there efficiently this may be for you .
GPS	POS	4	you should buy a gp system base on 1 primary criterion , accuracy of direction . the Pioneer system be fast and provide logical direction without constantly provide needless information . beware of off brand , they can give you illegal direction . I test a cheap mio handheld and be be direct to make left turn when you be require to make a right and use a jug handle . this mistake cause potential traffic accident and longer than necessary trip when be reroute . the PIO feature be nice , but I do not use it as often as expect . the bluetooth speaker option be awesome , and worth at least $ 100 for the safety factor .
GPS	POS	4	I will apologize for the long review to follow -lrb- I usually try to keep it to one screen -rrb- . over the past three year I have use three different gp unit from three different manufacturer . I think a side by side comparison might be useful . the technology continue to advance , as do the feature set offer in the way of traffic reporting\/rerouting and map update , so I will try to stick the general feature set\/usability of each unit unless it pertain to a feature that I can not see buy a gp without . the three GPS unit be a Motorola Motonav TN765T , TomTom XL 350TM and Garmin Nuvi 760 . Motorola Motonav TN765T pro : \* best screen resolution of the three \* fast trip calculation\/recalculation and voice input or destination be a great feature \* best overall display and on screen information content pertain to speed , direction , etc. . - light weight - plenty of expansion feature -lrb- at a cost -rrb- - 2d or 3d map render - phone Bluetooth integration be easy to setup - satellite lock be fast and stable con : - the mount be wonderfully articulate , so that you can mount and adjust it to you heart 's content , but it vibrates\/jiggles constantly in my car so that it make it hard to read the display - Motorola decide to place a couple of control on the back of the unit , and I find that I be constantly trigger they while adjust the unit - can you say advertisement ? I know you could - traffic information be often slow to load or incorrect -lrb- either I be already fifteen minute into a delay when it finally load , or it report a delay on a stretch of highway that be completely open -rrb- , but the TomTom and Garmin be no better - use with Bluetooth next to useless , even with the top up and window close my Miata be too noisy to make this usable -lrb- all of these gp unit rate the same in this respect , so I will not bother to repeat this -rrb- - limited map update -lrb- I think it be 6 month or less -rrb- - the accompany software never work successfully on my Windows 7 64bit system -lrb- maybe they have remedy this by now , at the time Windows 7 have just come out and Motorola be apparently not concern as they support personnel never respond to my contact -rrb- TomTom XL 350TM pro : \* lifetime map update be very nice -lrb- update be restricted to quarterly -rrb- - interface be easy to navigate \* traffic monitor include -lrb- no ad or expiration -rrb- -lrb- however , it be still often wrong -rrb- \* plenty of poi , many available via download -lrb- on the con side , the parent company do not seem to maintain these pous list or the accompany graphic , go figure , you would think that Starbucks and McDonald 's would want you to know just where to find all of they location and be able to readily identify they from the little icon -rrb- - map color modification , though I have not be able to get it to look just like the Garmin , which I find to be the best of the bunch in they default setting - I like the on screen information content , the essential be there , but the Motorola rule this feature - accompany software work well con : - mount bracket be good but not great , I get the least vibration , but it often break loose on I , such that I need to verify the ring be rotate fully clockwise -lrb- a simple lock mechanism would have be a great addition -rrb- - I have be bite a couple of time by allow the unit to reroute I past delay , beware that it do not monitor surface street traffic -lrb- I try to bypass the local fair highway traffic only to have it reroute I onto the surface street that wind directly past the fair turn a 30 minute delay into a 90 minute delay -rrb- - satellite lock be often slow to connect when the unit be turn on , especially in cloudy weather and can lose lock if the weather be poor - limited set of downloadable voice and vehicle avatar -lrb- unless you be willing to pay -rrb- Garmin Nuvi 760 pro : \* simplest interface , intuitive , require little or no documentation to get start use the device \* the mount bracket be by far the most secure with the least vibration and the easiest to fasten and remove the unit - best set of downloadable feature from voice to vehicle avatar , most free - accompany software work well con : - no map update - 3 month free traffic information , then you pay to subscribe to the free information -lrb- I see that both of these item be available in the newer version of the Garmin product -rrb- - while I prefer the default color scheme of the Garmin , the overall graphic display on this devise be below the minimal display I would expect from a GPS now overall impression : I find the Garmin to be the easiest to use and I notice that the current version include many of the feature that I find preferable in the other manufacturer 's model . I currently use the TomTom as the most functional of the unit that I currently own , however , if I be to buy a new unit at this time , I would opt for a Garmin base upon my experience with the above unit . p - -rrb-
GPS	POS	4	I have use a mio c310x for awhile before my son take it from I to leave for college , so I experience use a GPS Nav enough to understand and appreciate all aspect of the review by ` the Shadows ' . it be a honest , expertise and comprehensive one . I be about to buy one , though I do not like the TomTom one not to have phone number of poi that the mio do abundantly . Victor .
GPS	NEG	1	Magellan Roadmate 800 . this product should be ship directly from the manufacturer to the garbage dump . I recently use this to go from Eugene , or to Lake Tahoe , CA . the error , misdirection , and mis-routing on this one trip be far too numerous to list here . I will give 3 for you amusement . 1 . while go South on Interstate 5 it insist that I be go East . 2 . while sit in the Wal-Mart parking lot in Red Bluff , CA , I ask it to direct I to the nearest Wal-Mart . it tell I that it be 163 mile south . 3 . on my return to Eugene it route I through Placerville , which be fine . except once I get to Placerville it route I off the freeway and through several street and back onto the freeway , go in the opposite direction ... twice ! also , you can forget about find a rest stop on you way , it will route you 20 mile in the opposite direction when one be actually just a few mile up the road . save you $ 600 , buy a roadmap and a magnifying glass ...
