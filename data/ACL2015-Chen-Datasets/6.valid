GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be awesome . run everything max would out , and super cool -lrb- sub 70c -rrb- the entire time . I actually can play two game at once with both hit V-Sync cap , which be awesome when you like MMO 's .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	purchase this card in May 2012 . switch the bio and no unlock shader . put the position back to stock , read the bio , modify and re-flash to the secondary bio , still same result , no unlock shader . still a good card though , but do not expect to unlock it unless you can get you hand on a older revision of this card .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	just get this monitor adapter cord to hook up my second monitor . my computer only have one VGA port . I go to bestbuy and be tell I would have to spend upward of $ 100 to get a cord then a adapter for the cord in order to hook up dual monitor . I find this cord on Amazon and it work perfectly ! I be so excited . it be so easy to set up and now I have my dual monitor work ! Super fast ship too ! definitely recommend this product if you do not have two VGA port for a dual monitor setup .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	do not take my word for it , do a search on `` 560 ti 2gb artifact . '' you will find quite a few people with persistent similar problem who have also have to return this card multiple time . I be on my third card . after the first two I decide the problem must be something else on my system . now I have a new computer with a different brand of motherboard but the same graphic problem . evga send I a collection of test they want I to run even although the problem show up at the bio splash screen and have show up with this card install in two different computer . after all the time I have already waste test the multiple failure of this card this be the final straw . this be the fourth evga graphic card I have buy over the year . it will be my last .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I never write review . but this card be amazing . I be very skeptical at first , spend $ 400 + on a ` lottery card ' as people be call it . but with the new update from asus this card have be golden . OC have it a little with no problem , have not push it very far yet . I can play all my game on super high setting , there be shader and particle I never know exist ! I be in love . definately get a second for slus when I have extra money . love it !!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I must say , this product be amazing ! I be able to run ton of game on high or max setting , include Aion , Blacklight Retribution , Dragon Age 2 , dc universe , and League of Legends ! I love it do much . installation be pretty easy and I have never once install anything like this . just search YouTube for some guide and it 'll be a walk in the park . although , after first install it my pc do not recognize it but after a quick reboot it work like a charm . this should keep my computer able to run the newest game for year to come !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card help my 5 year old gaming system keep up with the newer game . this be a very very powerful card : -rrb-
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy the gtx570 2560 from another website , and this card be really great for gaming . I have everything ultra for sc2 and bf3 which run great . the only problem I encounter be the temperature , I read alot of review prior to my purchase , that mention this problem but I want something that be more future proof , so I decide to go for a high memory card . the card temperature stay at around 96 degree when I play bf3 and fan noise get loud at that point . I believe that the card be design to withstand higher temperature , however , I like to turn my evga precision on to check my card temp every time i play game . so i would suggest people who consider this card to go water cooling . p.s. when I buy this card it be sell out on like 5-6 major website that i go to , i be not sure if that be go to be the case in the future , but it might be something to do a research on if you think about SLI or buy one card at a time
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card run everything max out no problem . I have no problem put a additional overclock on the card beyond what the factory overclock be use EVGA 's precision x software . I be able to get +71 mhz of additional GPU clock offset and a additional +730 mhz additional memory clock offset . no stability issue , as fast if not faster than a reference 680 . very impressive . installation be simple . my previous card be a AMD hd4890 , and transition be smooth and easy . I simply remove the old driver , shutdown , replace the card , boot up , and install the new Nvidia driver . everything work as it should . be sure to get the latest driver from Nvidia 's website as the one on the disk that come with the card be not the latest .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	there be few manufacturer make they own version of hd 7970 , but I choose Sapphire HD 7970 OC . because it have big dual fan which be not only cool the card effectively but also very quiet . I be amaze how effective this cooling solution to the system . the other feature I like about , it have dual bio which be very good feature that you can lock in the highest clock speed . moreover , this card come with the complete accessory such as CrossFire connector , mini-dp to DVI dongle , hdmus to DVI adapter , mini-dp to dp cable , DVI to VGA adapter and 8-pin to 4-Pin Power cable . this card will stay in my system for quite a while until AMD introduce the new technology . I fully recommend this card to whom they be call as high-end gamer and Enthusiast . you will not regret .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this because I want to purchase rage and battlefield 3 and my current 5830 be not work with rage . I do get this thing work perfect with rage but I do have to shut off all my extra monitor and run rage with just one . this thing be powerful and nice but rage be just so demand . bf3 be not out yet but I believe it will work fine with that too .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Update 10\/14\/2011 . in the 2 week I have run my evga 590 I have have several people contact I via email on my profile with question . yes , it do show up in sisoft sandra as 2x580 's sli'e and not a 590 -lrb- at least my version of sandra - later version may learn to recognize the 590 card -rrb- . yes , I have run the 3dmark11 demo on the card and its goregeous , but no I will not make this a video review because that would mean cut the 16:9 down to amazon 's 4x3 format for review and super compress the datum to fit amazon 's video limit -lrb- the hd output file from my pro 3ccd camera be huge -rrb- until the quality of the original be go . I shoot the 32mark11 run 1920x1080 with a 1920x1080 camera carefully allign on axis of the monitor , exit the sound with fiber and go fiber to xlr into the camera 's line input for sound to produce a AVCHDPRO file of the demo . if you be serious about the card and want to really see the stunning hd video then please email I - I may convert the AVCHDPRO into AVCHD and then setup a download site on my server for the hd datum that you can watch in window media player at 1080x1920 , as it be mean to be view , with full stereo sound , but limit to people who have a system that warrant view hd , so please include you system config and I 'll reply with a download site \/ password if there be interest . there be 2 3dmark11 demo - the submarine and the jungle - with fulll lighting and smooth motion it be eye candy . -rrb- original review below : I buy my geforce 590 after upgrade a oem system which come with a geforce 2xx series to a geforce 480 now on craigslist with 1 year of use . I be amaze at the performance difference . the upgrade to the 590 have 3 time the memory , 1024 cuda core -lrb- essentially it be two gtx580 's SLI'ed in one card - it also need 4 ea slus power cable to run , along with a 850w p -rrb- . I do a lot of NLE video editing -lrb- hd 1080p\/1080i -rrb- and the 1024 cuda core really chew through hd video in a short time . the 590 be the BLEEDING edge , so there be some thing to keep in mind . first , you will need a power supply with 4 -lrb- four -rrb- of the normal 6 pin slus connector . the 590 come with two adapter - each take two 6 pin slus 's and make a 8 pin plug that fit one of the two 8 pin socket on the card . both socket must be fill for the card to work , so you will need 4 ea 6 pin slus 's or 2 ea 8 pin nvidium slus power cable to run the 3gb\/1024 processor graphic card . second , you will probably need to make a bio change . I lose my digital audio output - in fact I lose all audio output ! - basically you must go into bio setup and change the motherboard audio from `` auto '' which choose the dvi card to `` motherboard '' or just `` ON '' \/ `` default '' . my mobo be factory set to auto and once I switch it per the nvidium knowledgebase -lrb- very good btw -rrb- it find my optical audio output and headphones\/6 jack on the back . go from the 480 to the 590 also be a cleaner card . the fan on the 480 be smaller than the 590 . through the 590 's fan you can see the expensive japonese low-esr capacitor . it be basically a computer in and of itself . it will still require 2 slot - the \/ 16 slot along with the next card over for the fan , which be now in the middle of the card . on my 480 I get 3 monitor , however one use a micro hdmus , along with 2 dvi 's - on the 590 you can have 4 -lrb- yes four -rrb- monitor , and now they use the more robust mini-display-port instead of the micro hdmus which do not sag or bend the connector . get 4 monitor on a single card be pretty impressive -lrb- 3 dvi plus the minus display jack -rrb- . installation be easier with the 590 as there be no heatpipe extend above the card , as with the 480 . I will post a picture of both card on the static free foam - the 480 be in the foam and the 590 be remove from the foam with the larger fan . altogether , the 590 be simply the best graphic card -lrb- imho -rrb- on the market today . it be like have 2 580 's sli'e inside the same box . gamer will no doubt be thrill with its performance . note however that this review be for October 2011 . com soon to a store near you will be the evga nvidium 600 with performance and price exceed the 590 . Video and photographic user will find that the adobe cs5 package use the 1024 cuda core in such a way that the program be lightning fast . it be a very good investment in upgrade a old computer .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have do a lot with this card , play all sort of game bf3 , Skyrim , AvA , mw3 , Alan Wake , Saints Row 2 & 3 , and the list go on . all have be on the highest setting without the need to OC the card . it give a realistic look to Skyrim that it be almost sickening . I can not even describe the great detail within the game . be a serious gamer , I have not have the need to OC the card and not much heat really come from it -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- , but I have a lot of fan move a lot of cool air into my tower .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	the good news and bad news about this card : the good news - great card ! I buy it as the `` last best '' videocard for my agp motherboard - I take the advice on tom 's hardware and get this card . and it raise my performance hugely -lrb- my old video card be a 128mb geforce -rrb- , with no problem . it be a little tricky get the latest driver -lrb- best bet be to go to sapphire tech : -lrb- ... -rrb- -rrb- , but otherwise no problem . the bad news be - they do not really tell you -lrb- and the manual be also very cryptic about it -rrb- , but it turn out it need _ 2 _ 4-pin power supply connector feed into it . as my old video card need _ 0 _ such power supply connector , this be a issue : -rrb- . it be easily remedy by buy power supply splitter cable , which only cost about $ 4 -lrb- look at the ` people who buy this also buy ' section -rrb- , but if you do not order they in advance , and you be not near a Fry 's , you may have buy this video card and be unable to install it .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	after look at the review there be no way you can be disappoint with the evga gtx670 . First off , evga have great support , and the guy over at EVGA be great people . EVGA have be around for a very long time , and they even have they own forum where tech support help you out . as for the gtx670 performance be stellar despite the fact it be not as fast as a gtx680 , it 'll max out pretty much every game at 1080p without issue . after look at the review , it be a very impressive card . so not only be you get a great card , you be also get a top brand with a solid 3 year warranty , and solid support . evga from what I understand , also have a 90 day step up program , so if you want to upgrade within 90 day from the date of purchase to a newer product , you can through that program . people have also report that overclock the gtx670 can make it faster than a stock clock gtx680 . that be pretty impressive .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have get a three monitor setup -lrb- 2 x 23 '' lead and 1 x 47 '' lcd -rrb- . the 47 '' be power by this adapter . installation to use take about five minute , with very simple instruction . it do exactly what it say . highly recommend .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	extremely quiet even when the fan speed be high -lrb- compare to the 4870x2 it replace it be silent -rrb- . Easy installation and it handle all the game I own without break a sweat . I will give it a true test when Skyrim come down in price , but Diablo III do not even cause it to elevate setting and Arkham City at maximum with full dx11 effect only stutter once in 3 hour . my first Nvidia card and I be impressed . the OC software be simple to use and monitor temp and fan speed be easy to do . a little spendy , but warranty protection for a OC would card and the superior cooling be worth it . when the price drop I may likely add a second card in SLI mode .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	when I buy this , it be $ 165 , plus another $ 20 back in a mail-in rebate . for that amount of money , it be the best card you can buy . I have three monitor run a eyefinity display -lrb- one continuous display -rrb- to play Skyrim on three monitor , and I can play with the highest graphic setting without any lag . to install this card , I have to move my hard drive around so that the bay across from the pci-e port be open . this card be huge , but the cooling system be fantastic , and despite what some other review say , I can not hear the fan even on full unless I mute Skyrim . the install disc that come with the graphic card be corrupt , so I just download the software and driver from the Sapphire website . also , they do not tell you this , but you also get a free steam download of dirt 3 . it be 11gb , though , and I have not get to it yet ...
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	this video card be purchase to replace a older geforce 3 video card that be die that be use for s-video output . I be disappoint with the new GeForce 6200 over the lack of resolution performance . you would think that this would increase over the time between the 2 card be release .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	my friend show I he quad slus gtx295 in he new gaming computer . that be right ... four 1792mb graphic card ! let just say , `` Crysis on Maximum Qality '' be no problem ... even for Vista .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	just get this card for a new build . paired it with a Intel i3-2120 and it work great . this card be pretty big , so if you have a small case , you might want to get a newer one to handle how long it be . as for gaming performance it work very well . I be use it to play Batman : ac , Star Wars : The Old Republic , WoW , Portal 2 and Dirt 3 all on high . never a hiccup with fp , even under full load it never get very hot and the fan be super quiet . all and all if you look for a good GPU that will not break the bank like a 7970 , this be what you want . it be a much better value then the 6850 and should keep you rig go for a few year at acceptable graphic level . also would like to give a shout out to the people at Neogaf who help I put together this rig , thanks guy !
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	decent card , it can run game like wow close to ultra @ 30-60 fp . do not do so well with shadow or really scenery heavy game like FSX . it overclock well but I have find that it can be somewhat unstable -lrb- even when not overclock -rrb- . it be not very loud , 500 watt be all I need for the power supply , it come with 2 4 pin peripheral-6 pin converters\/extension cord . finally it be fairly big : it be as long as the motherboard and while it only need one pcie plug it will take up 2 pcus slot at the back of the computer . it sit up far enough from the motherboard to avoid hit the bio and stuff like that that might be sit around you card . do not know if I 'll ever get my rebate though and the Dirt 3 coupon have already be expire for half a month when I get it . so not the best service .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	pro : + can handle every game throw at it and still be able to run at a decent fp , even at stock . + able to have a stable overclock to 1250\/1450 . + nice and quiet . + come with lot of extra cable and adapter . con : - update version of Sapphire TrixX be not out yet so sometimes the OC for it glitch out . temp be around 26c at idle and around 48c at full load . do I have any buyer remorse with the keplar card come out ?? hell nah !! I be perfectly happy with the performance of this card !!
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	despite Amazon 's description above , this video card be not compatible with dvi-i connection . in several place on the outer packaging , it clearly state that this card be compatible with dvi-d , d-sub and hdmus , not dvi-i .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	product come with only a cd - no install insttruction . could not use CD until after the card be install and operate use the m driver that be initially install when new hardware be detect at bootup . my os be WXP . I be able to get the correct driver from the cd to load by the followig procedure : Control Panel\/System\/Hardware \/ deveice manager\/display adapters\/properties\/driver tab\/update driver\/select `` yes this time only '' , then Next\/select `` install from a list or specific locaton , next\/select `` search for the best driver in these location '' and check `` search removable media '' , have the cd in the CD drive and select the next button . this should start the CD ... follow the instruction on the screen .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I buy this card from Fry 's since the video card I have currently in my p4 be only 64 meg and can not play hidef video . after I install the card , window no longer boot . I try reseed the card , no luck , window still do not boot . I put the old video card back in , and window load normally . I try put the new video card in and again , after post run , nothing happen , window do not load , just a blinking cursor . I be go to return this card and try a different brand .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	48 hour and thus far work we great , very quite and cool . Intel mb , Azza case , i5 Processor . . Temp idel be in the low-mid 30 . use primarily for FSX .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	buy it not too long ago and have be run codmw3 on it . Works very well and have have no problem at all .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the video card be just what I need and I know the product before cause I have one once before and it be and still be play game 's with the grandson now ...
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the Sapphire Radeon HD Radeon 7870 OC be the perfect overall match . a Sapphire low power consumption , a modest oc , gaming max at 1920x1080 or lower , newest series and a amazing price . I have two small con , when run high end gaming the fan be medium noise level . note I be complain about medium fan noise not high . I run my NZXT full tower at low fan speed . when a high end game start run you can hear a boost in the GPU 's noise level . I have hear of game issue 's with the new 7000 series , but I have not run into any and from what I have hear they should all be patch in time . I would not be surprise if this GPU could run game on high at 2560x1600 and would definitely easily do it with crossfire . a lot of tech seem to underrate the performance of card . my Radeon 6770 run a native 1680x1050 , but it be able to handle 1920X1080 at high setting and catalyst overscan to make the display fit the screen , it could even run Ultra , but performance would take a small hit and I be sure it would have overheate with extend play if I have do so . my last complaint be catalyst do not have a power consumption section which be strange because my Radeon 6770 do . the real seller be the price 300 with oc . Main competition be gtx 570 superclock at 280 . twenty buck less , but big power consumption difference , probably longer , older model , worse performance . Radeon 7870 OC be better and ultimately cheaper . when add the cost of a higher cost psu and higher power bill you easily get you money back . very satisfied and will crossfire when the price drop even more .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	I choose to buy this one because of the 2bio setting and it can easily unlock the shader into 6970 . but it look like the new version -lrb- from first week of 2012 , the time i bring it -rrb- can not , no matter i flash it myself or use the magic switch on the card . CAN NOT UNLOCK the shader . I get the replacement , same issue happend there . if you want to buy one with the really unlock shader , find a use one maybe a good choice . I look some of the review on the Newegg , same issue happend . the new sapphire dirt 3 edition can not unlock shader anymore .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	my old graphic card be shoot , replace it with visiontek ATI Radeon HD Graphics Card . the first one I receive from Amazon do not work . I call Visiontek at first thinking I screw up the installation -lrb- it be very simple to install -rrb- they rep. tell I the new card be shoot . contact Amazon and they replace it next day mail and it be all good . the fan be a bit noisy at start up , but quiet down after a few minute .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I do a lot of research before decide on this card . the main thing that make I decide to buy it be ; 1 . high quality component . this card be not a cheap version of a 6950 , it be a solid card with japanese make capacitor -lrb- the best -rrb- and great construction . 2 . quiet ! this card be 100 % quieter than my last card , a 4890 . my wife love it that my computer can not be hear in the other room now ! 3 . cool ! this card run extremely cool . the two fan configuration do a excellent job keep it cool -lrb- and be also the reason it be so quiet , the fan can run at a lower rpm and still provide more cooling than a single fan -rrb- . 4 . fast fast fast . this card , while not a reference design -lrb- for unlock shader -rrb- be still a very fast card . it blow away every game I throw at it , and I can finally run crysis at max setting ! one thing to remember about reference vs. non-reference card be that when you unlock the shader , you only get a 3 % performance boost , and that be at the cost of a hotter running and louder card -lrb- due to the single fan -rrb- . bottom line , if you be look for a great clard that be fast , quiet , cool , and have some overclockability , this be the one to get .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this so that I could install  Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate  Sparkle Graphics card be do the job . very happy with it .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this be a review for the rebate portion of the card . if you be not interested , then do not read . however , I be post this because I feel it be pertinent information , and for I , it be what determine my get this card from this manufacturer . long story short , they have provide completely conflict information on the process of the rebate , and will do whatever it take to make sure that you will never get you rebate in the window that they originally advertise . here be the documentation of my experience : on Thu , Jun 21 , 2012 at 6:55 pm ,  write : -rrb- Dear xxxxxx , -rrb- -rrb- we be pleased to inform you that you rebate , with the basic service -rrb- level you select have be process and approve on 06\/21\/2012 . -rrb- -rrb- you Amex  reward card will be mail within 8-10 week . please contact -rrb- we if you have any additional question . -rrb- -rrb- Below be the summary of you rebate registration information : -rrb- -rrb- track Number : xxxxxxxx -rrb- rebate offer : Sapphire special mail-in rebate -rrb- rebate Item : Sapphire Radeon hd6950 2g ddr5 pcie -rrb- rebate Item UPC number -lrb- s -rrb- : xxxxxxxx -rrb- rebate award : $ 20.00 -rrb- Service level Basic : $ 0.00 -rrb- final award : $ 20.00 so , 8-10 week go back from 6\/21\/12 . nothing happen . the tracking number they give I do not work , either .

I hope everyone be able to get they rebate and for I , it be just a fluke , but I think they response show they do not take customer service very seriously at all .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I buy this for my boyfriend & he love it , when it arrive he could not wait to install it into he computer . once he do he love it . once it be in he computer the graphic & game in he system work alit better . definatly worth the money & better yet the look on he face .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this accessory have boost my productivity significantly , I purchase the DVI connector as I think it would be faster . I have no complaint whatsoever . I call for support for something I could have fix myself -lrb- reinstall the driver -rrb- and they be very fast to answer . I be use 2 large 1920 by 1200 with a small laptop and my life will never be the same , I be now get one for home , so I can work consistently at home and work ! loving this device , a small cost for a large gain of productivity ! I buy one for everyone in we company who want it !
GraphicsCard	POS	4	Easy to install and Windows xp configure the card . update the driver and good to go . the price be right for my new hd monitor . I be not a gamer or movie watcher on my pc .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I go online and fill out the rebate form but while you be fill out the rebate , there be no where that say the address have to match the billing until you go to print out the last page -lrb- which you normally assume be correct -rrb- . I send the rebate in right away , and it show that they receive it but they do not send I a email regard the rejection until the last day that I be able to resubmit . also , the reason state that the invoice\/packing slip be invalid and not that the address do not match . obviously I didnt get my rebate and all I get be rude service .

GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I buy this card as a upgrade to my Sapphire hd5750 . this card be well build , not flashy and very powerful ! it install fairly easily , although I have to move my hard drive to a different slot in my case as this card span the entire inside of my Antec 900 case . the performance be amazing . battlefield 3 run at 80 + fp on Ultra @ 1280x1024 . on high\/ultra hybrid I be get 120 + fp . last night I notice some choppiness while play . I exit my game to try and free up some resource and start get artifact -lrb- video error -rrb- on my screen . my display freeze , go blank and then return say the driver crash and be recover . it loop this way forever . I have do everything software wise to fix this , and I believe it be a corrupt memory issue on the card , but I can not confirm this . I have do no modification , over clock etc. to any of my hardware . the GPU sit at a comfortable 45-48c and never have fan issue . see the video below for the artifacting . I check a `` Egg Themed '' online retailer and find that there be 7 of 127 review that be negative . almost all of they seem to have the same freezing artifact issue , so it do not appear to be a fluke . all this be say , I be still go to get this card . I will send this back -lrb- Amazon service have be great !!! -rrb- and get another and cross my finger . again , this card be AWSOME , when it work .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	the card itself be outstanding . the performance really be second to none . 2560x1600 and no issue here on any of the current game like bf3 . would love to get 2 of these in slus . evga support also rock as well . the customer service be top notch , speak to two rep already on some installation issue and they be really helpful and nice to talk to . you really can not go wrong with evga and I probably would not bother with other brand myself . not say there be not other good brand but I prefer evga . I think the price be pretty fair because of the performance but you can always hope it will go down in price . this be the top perform graphic card out there right now , so consider that , it command a premium price .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I get my evga 560 TI 448 in earlier today and just get finish install it . it replace a EVGA gtx 280 . I uninstall the nVidia driver , reboot to safe mode and run DriverCleaner . reboot to Windows 7 and d\/l ` ed the 266.66 and the 285.62 to test which be better . I begin to install the 285.62 and it could not find a support device , same with the 266.66 . sooo , I actually resort to use the CD setup and it work like a charm . I be get a 24.8 fp avg in Unigen Heaven with the 280 on dx10 with a score of 625 . I run the same setting with the 560 and hit 40.8 fp avg with a score of 1029 . I have not touch the clock yet so I can not comment on the O.C. I usually do not O.C. my video card anyway . my system be a e8500@4ghz run 4gig of ddr2 ocz reaper @ 800mhz . not sure if it be bottleneck yet . evga be great with a replacement I have about 3 year ago so I feel confident in the selection . I be still not certain if the price increase be worth it for the extra core and memory , but we will see .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	run Battlefield 3 on Ultra at 40-45fp and with frap run at 35-40fp . should have get 2 and run they in Crossfire but this be a budget build and I be 100 % satisfied with the result .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I need a bigger , faster card for my son 's pc so he could play Lego Universe -lrb- which be a Christmas present this year -rrb- . this card be list on they sy req page . plug it in , and this card put the old 128mb power color to shame . great speed , great graphic , better quality graphic and speed for the game he already play . great deal for my 7yr old son 's computer .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	first thing that hit I be that this thing be enormous ! I have have 2 slot video card before but this one feel so much bigger . the heat sink be outrageously large . ca not say anything else yet . I have to figure out how to fit this into the tight space in my pc ... Update : just so happen that my old video card -lrb- 8800gt -rrb- die from overheate , so I have no choice but take my pc apart to fit this monster in . so far so good ! Works as expect . big improvement over the old card in both performance score and the card be roughly 20f cooler than the old one .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this card as a replacement for 128 meg card that be begin to humm and buzz . the new card work with no problem , but the thing that surprise I be that it noticeably speed up other application that I run constantly . the control panel provide with it be also very nice .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be great ! it be easy to overclock and have never reach a temp of over 60c when play battlefield 3 on ultra graphic setting . would highly recommend for any gamer .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	do not get this product . it mess up all the software that be on my computer . also it could not even do a simple power point presentation .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card its magnificent , it can run every posible game at this moment without problem . Asus do a great job with the package of the card , really good look . apart from that this its just like any other 680 reference card in the market , with 3 year warranty . the one i have its from a good batch , it overclock really well -lrb- core : 1300 \/ memory : 6800 -rrb-
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I be turn my old computer into a dvr -lrb- use Windows 7 Media Center -rrb- , and be unable to use the on board graphic to get over the Air hd channel in . I purchase this to fix that problem , and it do beyond belief !!!! I install this in a Dell Dimension 3000 , with Intel Pentium 4 -lrb- 2.8 ghz -rrb- with 1.5 gb of RAM , run Windows 7 Professional x86 . the Dell Dimension 3000 only have pcus slot , so I be limit to what I can use , most newer card be pci-express , so find a pcus card , that be any good be tough . I then come to this product . with 512mb of memory and a pcus connection this be a great choice ! I open up the computer and plug this card into a available PCI slot -lrb- the heat sink on the card be large , so you may need to put it away from other card -rrb- , and turn on the computer . straight from boot the computer could use this pcus card and have no problem use VGA . Windows detect it and I install the software -lrb- I do not use the CD , instead I download the latest software from NVIDIA 's website -rrb- . I reboot the computer and be look at great graphic with super fast performance ! I plug in a hdmus cable go to my tv and it switch over with no problem , so now I have Video and Sound go through the HDMI cable from this card !!!! I have test the computer by view video from my tv tuner -lrb- over the Air HD programming -rrb- and have no problem . all the video that would not play before -lrb- like Media Center DVR content play perfectly -rrb- and they be no shutter or video problem ! when I run the Windows experience here be my result : Processor : 3.7 memory : 4.1 graphic : 4.2 gaming graphic : 4.5 -lrb- amazing improvement !!! -rrb- primary hdd : 4.1 the result before the new card be install -lrb- Intel Integrated Graphics -rrb- : Processor : 3.7 memory : 4.1 graphic : 1.9 gaming graphic : 1.0 primary hdd : 4.1 in the end this be a great video card for any computer not just older computer -lrb- although a more powerful one might be need for gaming -rrb- . I be extremely happy with this card , from the easy installation and driver from NVIDIA to the hdmus output to my tv , it be great !!! I highly recommend for anyone look to speed up a older computer . I be use this computer as a dvr use Windows Media Center for watch tv and recording . here be the spec of my system to help anyone out : Dell Dimension 3000 Original Motherboard Intel Pentium 4 , 2.8 ghz 1.5 gb of memory -lrb- 1024 + 512 mb chip -rrb- Windows 7 Professional , 32 bit for the price and feature this card can not be beat !!! I highly recommend it !!!!
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this piece of junk work once , after reboot I have no display . I reinstall my old card and it work fine . DO NOT BUY !!!!!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have no issue unlock to the 6970 bio . this card have a switch to select which bio you want to use . you do not need to flash the bio on the card . you do need to completely remove all amd\/ati graphic driver before move the switch to 6970 , then re-install the driver clean . card run cool 99f to 104f idle , to 152f under severe load and overclock . I be use Sapphire TriXX to OC to 880 and 1375 -lrb- stable and cool -rrb- and it moderately raise the temperature and fan speed . I easily push it to 900\/1400 -lrb- stable but higher temp -rrb- with a voltage increase . I be extremely happy with this purchase .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	buy the card to replace 2 gtx 460 's in SLI . mainly for the increase VRAM . my 460 's be the dumb down model that only have 768mb of VRAM . which really be not enough to game at 1080p on a 1920x1080 resolution . I notice performance hit in a lot of high end game graphic wise like Crysis , Metro 2033 and even skyrim with mod install . stutter be common in large open environment and it be a pain in the ass to deal with . the 448 core fix all of these problem . no more stuttering in large open environment and I can max graphical setting without any hitch . to my surprise the 448 core be actually faster stock then my 460 's be overclock . maybe it be just my system , but most review show slus 460 's beat a single 448 core\/570 and just a hair below a gtx 580 in term of performance . overclock can fix that too since the 448 core be a great overclocker . my motherboard be a huge bottleneck for my entire system be a old am2 board but even then I have be able to push this 448 core to 880mhz stable @ 1.075 v so far . this be usually achievable with lower voltage for most people . so I 'll probably be lucky to hit 900mhz at 1.1 v. but even then the performance increase from 80mhz be noticable . the card run cool with a tweaked fan profile I have set in MSI Afterburner . it idle at around 30c and load around 68-70c while gaming . for the price I get this card at it be definitely worth it consider I 'll probably be able to turn around and sell my 460 's for a equal cost . mean this card practically cost I nothing . if you can get a 448 core for $ 220 or less then jump on it . people argue that the gtx 480 be a better deal but the card be on a older fab that run way hotter . that be the main issue I have with the gtx 480 be the amount of heat it put out and that it consume more power . another nice thing about this version of the 448 be how small the card actually be . this one be only 9 inch long . a few other like the Classified or Ultra model be 10.5 in so that may be something to consider if it be a tight space in you case . a few thing to remember if you be think about buy this card be that this will not sli with anything BUT another 448 core . a regular 560 or 560 ti will not do . so if you plan on go SLI in the future remember also that this card be a limited edition so it be probably go to stop sell soon and become hard to find . so get 2 right off the bat . another thing , if you use benchmark like Furmark or OCCT the 500 series Nvidia card have a build in power protection that automatically downclock the card to keep it within power draw specification . I find this out after run occt and think my overclock be stable . boy be I wrong and disappointed . you will have to stress stability the old fashion way of hardcore gaming and look for artifacts\/waiting for the game to crash and you driver to reload , lol .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I replace a Radeon 92oo with this card for more mb of memory , wrong move . this card just freeze after booting-up . Tech support send I to they web-site to fix the problem , but the graphic freeze before a fix could be downlode . Poped the Radeon back in and all be great . I be go to buy a radeon instead . guess i get burn by get this card from Amazon , because now I have to keep it . Stay away from this card !!!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	ever since I switch from a desktop to a laptop , one of my two desktop monitor be leave unused as the laptop 's graphic card could only connect to one of they at a time . this be a acceptable scenario , as I could just use the laptop 's screen as the second monitor in the setup . however , as time go on , I want to do something with my unused desktop monitor , and I find this device . it will not work without the proper driver , which come in a cd . because my laptop do not have a CD drive , I quickly find the driver on the StarTech.com website -lrb- easy to find driver -- another bonus ! -rrb- . as soon as I install they and plug in the device , my unused monitor spring to life for the first time in month . the image quality be great , but not perfect . I occasionally see wavy line on the monitor connect by the device , but these line be only visible when I be try to find something wrong with the display . plus , base on what I have read , mild image issue like that be to be expect and be likely a limitation of usb external graphic card . finally , the price of this adapter be great compare to other offer similar resolution . I would recommend this device to anybody .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	just get this card in the mail last night . I have my hd 5850 Overclocked to 900Mhz and i still could only play bf3 at medium to low setting with a average of 20-40fp . this card right out of the box hold 60 + fp on Ultra setting with 4x msaa at 1080p on my 42 '' 120hrz hdtv -lrb- my monitor -rrb- . I overclock it to 1.3 Ghz in less than 20minute with no previous know how of precision X. memory at 3.5 Ghz as well . you must set a custom fan profile if you want the card to stay under 70c -lrb- which it must or the card will throttle its self and you will loose you GPU boost preset -rrb- . mine average 65-68c with 85 % fan . it blow hot air out the back like a space heater but its a cool run card compare to gtx 580\/590 ect . its a bit loud compare to my system that run nearly silent . my rig a half 922 with Intel i2600k at 5ghz . with overclock i get 85-130fp in bf3 . amazing card . I have order a ASUS 7970 direct CU II TOP previously that be DOA ! this be before the gtx 680 be release . im glad that card be DOA actually because this card be amazing . I also can honestly say the driver for this card be next to non . I know every one say that AMD driver be not that great but im here to personally say that they be far inferior compare to Nvidia ... sad because i love AMD and just upgrade from a CRosshair Formula 4 \/ Phenom x6 1090t that now sit on my shelf along with my AMD video card . im off track but my old rig be good BUTTT my new rig smoke my old one hand down and be worth the $ and then some . great card and i recomend it to any one who have that cash . I be think i might have to slus this card with another gtx 680 but this card overclock so well i wont have to in the near or far future . without a overclock it still tear whole through ULTRA set on all game . cheer and let the head shot begin !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have a HP a250n pentium 4ht 2.60 mhz with 1gb RAM run Windows 7 . I have be think about buy a new pc , but figure it would be WAY cheaper to just upgrade my video card . after search around for agp4x\/8x video card , I find that the hd3850 get the most praise out of the other 512mb card , so I decide to give it a shot . as soon as I take the hd3850 out of the box , I new I be in for something awesome . when I switch out my NVIDIA geforce5200 128mb card to the hd 3850 , the fp on doom 3 sky rocket ... not to mention overall pc performance . also , Fallout 3 and leave 4 dead run a smooth 30fp at 1024x768 . this card give new life to my pc . dual DVI , S-Video , dual monitor support ... but no 1080p . only thing be that you have to get a 450w or greater power supply with 30amp on 12 volt with 2x4 power connector recommend . if you be look into get one of these , you might want to do some research before it arrive at you doorstep , so that you have everything you need to install it and have it up and run in no time without any issue .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	we use these for computer that do not come with native dual-monitor video output and they work very well . they be inexpensive and when deal with a wide range of computer form factor and hardware , they portability to any usb-enabled computer be a huge plus .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	let first start off with what system I have . I have this HP DC5100 small form factor computer with pentium 4 3 GHz HT processor , 3 gb ram , and 40 gig hardrive . I recently install Windows Vista Ultimate which run good on it except for the on board video which would not let I run the Windows Aero and some other program like Windows dvd maker . I figure I would upgrade the video card for when my daughter would visit so they would have a decent computer to use . the video card install with no problem as long as you follow the instruction like disable the on board video first in bio and then install the card and then install the new driver in safe mode . the card do come with small profile kit so I can not understand why Amazon have a small profile kit that it tell you to buy with it . well , I waist my money on that ! well , not to much because the kit be only $ 6.95 well all and all the card work good with what I need . I would recommend the card if all you be look for be just run Windows Vista . I be not sure how it work for gaming because I be not in to that note : I run the base score again and it raise my score from a 1.9 to a 2.6 which be a shock . I think it would of be higher because the only thing I be lack be a video card from what it tell I . Windows Aero 2.6 and 3d business and gaming graphic be 3.9
GraphicsCard	POS	5	buy this card a few day ago and it be work flawlessly . I replace a two year old Sapphire Radeon hd4870 which could not handle dx11 game to my liking . this card have exceed my expectation so far . couple quick tip when do any card installation . download the latest driver for you new card prior to uninstall the old card . I then remove my old driver prior to install the new card . I also remove any special software the old card come with . put the new card in , clean out the case while I as at it , and boot up . install the new driver , restart , and be good to go .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I install the driver and when my computer restart I get black screen on my laptop . I have to restart and go to safe mode in order to uninstall the driver , so I could get my display back . I try to do it twice , and get the same result , so give up and return it .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	originally , I buy the MSI 7970 Lightning because of the legendary performance that usually come with the lightning product line . unfortunately , I be only able to overclock the card to 1170 on the core and 1500 on the VRAM . this be in line with the experience that reviewer related , but it be a bit disappointing . in addition , the lightning that I have would occasionally lock up , even when it be not overclock . for six Benjamins , I be not go to put up with that , so I send it back . after scour the review , I decide that I would get a gtx 680 , even though I be uncomfortable with the 2 gb of VRAM -lrb- I game at 2560x1600 -rrb- . the reason I be a little doubtful be that when I track VRAM usage in skyrim with all my hd mod , I frequently utilize all of the 3 gb of VRAM on the 7970 . despite these misgiving , I settle down to wait for a gtx 680 to pop up . then I have a chance to get a Sapphire Dual-X 7970 OC for four hundred thirty dollar . I have read good review on the Sapphire 7970 , and be impress with the overclock that reviewer be able to get on they . I decide to take a chance on the Sapphire over the gtx 680 , since it be nearly a hundred less than what I could get a 680 for . so far , I be very glad I take the plunge . the oc I be get on the card I get be amazing ! I can play Skyrim at 1270 on the core and 1700 on the VRAM -lrb- at 1.2 volt -rrb- with no problem . and I have not even push it to the max yet to see how high I can go ! at these speed , I think I be get better performance than a overclocked gtx 680 would provide . to top it off , the Sapphire cooler be both quieter and cooler than the MSI lightning cooler . Max temp with my MSI be about 70 c in game , but I have not ever hit above 65 c with my Sapphire yet . the only two issue I see be a potential problem be a slight coil whine when I abuse the card in Furmark -lrb- no sound at all during gaming , though -rrb- , and the fact that the 7970 will not wake up after the computer go to sleep . I have to reboot it . however , that be a problem with all 7970s it seem , since my msus do it too , and I have read that a lot of other people have the same problem . the other sticking point for I be Sapphire 's warranty . sure , 3 year be good , but several manufacture be do the warranty by serial number instead of have it stick with the purchaser . this could be a problem if you ever want to sell the card in the future . if Sapphire do they warranty by serial number , like some of they competition , that would be a huge boost in they favor . in short , if you want a fantastic video card for a great price , look no further . get it !
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	I first install this card use Windows 2000 pro , and it work very well . then I do a new install of Windows 7 , and now many program include Combat Flifht Simulator will not run at all - even after get the win7 driver from Nvidia .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	I buy this video card to give I Aero capability on a old HP desktop -lrb- 2004 model -rrb- for a Windows 7 upgrade . the video work great . the only problem I have encounter be my pc will not wake up from sleep mode . I do contact evga for support and they be responsive but could not fix the problem -lrb- it be a old computer with old bio -rrb- . for the money it have save I from a computer upgrade for another year or two so it be worth it .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this product could not be install without the 6-prong power adapter-not included\/not sell at Radio Shack or best buy \/ no way to use the product without have it professionally install because no one else sell the cable . a waste of my time and my money .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I install Richard burn rally game but would not play on my old Dimension 4600 due to lack of pixel shading . plug unit in and voila all be well . shredding rbr on the daily now . thanks evga and Amazon
GraphicsCard	POS	4	this video card perform great !!! too bad my corsair caviar green hdd be too slow , because this video card can play max on bf3 and mw3 no problem . the lag be the result of my hdd , but I be upgrade to corsair force ssd soon . this be a great video card . very large , though . take up the slot adjacent to it on the motherboard .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	pro : - inexpensive htpc card . - have win7 driver -lrb- though might be rough install -rrb- . - have a HDMI Port . - claim to be support . - come in a small box . con : go from Aero Windows experience index of 4.1 to that of 3.7 when swap in this card . the previous card be a 3 + year old atus x1300 . how be that possible ? driver install require patience , and a few crash . suggest buy NVidia . other thought : bought hd4350card to replace a still good htpc graphic card that ATI no longer support under Windows 7 : be run a Dell P-Duo as a htpc for more than a few year , just fine , with a ATI x1300 graphic card . upgrade to Windows 7 for 7MC , and start have video source switching issue , fix require a new Video card . ATI decide stop support a old product , fine . but the new product benchmark -lrb- artifical or not -rrb- worse ? three year later ?!? ridiculous . ati\/amd have alienate yet another customer .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	have no issue with delivery , installation and operation . even have some documentation , which i do not have to use . hardware : HP ACPI x86 base desktop , model nr a6250z . replacement for original ge force after it bite the dust . like large heat sink , no fan - no noise , less power consumption . Make sure to install driver .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	this product be easy to install on my computer . it enhance the video capibility by 100 % on my Dell Dimension 4600 that be purchase in mid-2004 .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the onboard graphic card on my old Dell Dimension e521 have only a VGA graphic port . when I decide to set up dual display -lrb- a monitor and a projector -rrb- , I go with this graphic card , which will support dual -lrb- possibly three monitor -rrb- monitor . its low price -lrb- 35 when I buy it -rrb- and the positive review be what clinch it for I . the installation of the card be easy . I simply insert it in the PCI slot of the computer , hook up the cable , fire up the computer , install the driver on the CD -- and it be work . I be also pleasantly surprise that it improve performance on my Photoshop CS5 very noticeably . dual Monitor support -------------------- this card have 3 graphic port : hdmus , DVI , and VGA . so , you could conceivably set up 3 monitor with it . I use the DVI connection for my monitor and the VGA on my projector -lrb- which have neither DVI or HDMI connector -rrb- . with the VGA connection I do run into a problem with `` ghost '' on my projector display . as a workaround , I run a hdmus cable from the HDMI port to a `` hdmus to VGA Converter , '' and a VGA cable from the `` hdmus to VGA Converter '' to my projector -- this setup solve the ghost problem ! improve Graphics Performance ----------------------------- one app that I use very often be Photoshop -lrb- cs5 -rrb- . however , it be always be very sluggish on my computer . one particular problem that irk I be I when I press and hold down the space bar to temporarily use the hand tool , the image would not pan or if it do , it be choppy and excruciatingly slow . after I install this graphic card , the problem be go . Photoshop be now very responsive and much faster than before . -- if you want to set up dual monitor or if you have a onboard graphic card and want improved graphic performance , the ASUS GeForce 8400GS card be a good bet . be aware of the potential VGA ghost problem with dual Monitor setup however . apart from the VGA ghost problem -lrb- which I find a workaround for -rrb- , I be immensely please with this graphic card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I spend all day on the computer at work and at home , usually with several window open for reference on the same project . my laptop -lrb- Dell e5410 -rrb- only support two monitor through its built-in graphic card and I want a third to avoid all the window switching I do now . I receive the adapter , download and install the latest driver from Startech -lrb- as explain in the package -rrb- , I plugged-in the adapter and connect the cable . 5 or less minute later I have 2048x180 on 3rd monitor . no problem with performance or app error , seem very stable .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this to use in conjunction with a Ivy Bridge processor 's integrated graphic so I could run 3 monitor without have to use DisplayPort . it seem that 2 DVI port on a graphic card be rare , this be one of the only one I find . I have 1 monitor run through HDMI off the Ivy Bridge 's graphic , and the other 2 monitor off the 2 DVI port on this card , and after a little tweaking in the bio etc. it work like a charm . I do not use it too heavily , no game or anything , but it be simple and painless and work great , so I be quite happy . the only thing that be not great be the rebate process - I hate these , they try to make it so difficult to get the rebate I guess hope you will give up and not go for it . just make the thing cheaper instead ! but they say my check be come in 6-8 week , so I guess I penetrate the bureaucracy !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	after purchase and install this in my rig , it have outperform all my expectation . Run SWTOR on max setting beautifully . play game like Crysis 2 , Dead Space 2 , Far Cry have all be flawless . battlefield 3 be almost all on max setting . mw3 max out . wow play fantastic but its not a GPU heavy game but still make it look very nice . get a strong 7.8 Windows score . install afterburner and have it now tune and stable at over 1000mhz . most of it be do without any voltage tweak whatsoever . I think it be stable at 1040 with no voltage as I stress test it with Crysis and Crysis 2 . after 3-4 hour on Crysis it show sign of artifact . I back the clock down to 1020 and its be stable since then . after I voltage adjust it , I could maintain 1040 with no issue . have not go higher as it work great for the game I play . great card with enormous OC potential . stay cool even at OC would spec . Heatsinks and the copper pipe dissipate the heat very well .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this install in a 8 year old pa computer with no problem . the driver and control program work as they should and it adjusted my VGA monitor for the best picture image for my 3 year old monitor . I want to try it with hdmus as money permit .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	for $ 56 it would be worth it . for $ 99.99 , not so much . any computer that have only PCI slot probably only have a single core processor so this card will help , but not dramatically . I be use the computer for a secondary character with wizard101 . the page still take time to load but the movement be smoother .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card be so efficient , it handle everything i play . it be my first Nvidia card , except the gtx 560m in my g 74 gaming laptop . ive have a 6870 , 7870 and now this one , its like I do not have to worry about any hiccup or tear etc. ... I be definetly sell with Nvidia and its be hard to come to this and I do not know why ? maybe b\/c I always cheer for the underdog ? LOL whatever but I have nothing negative to say about my 680 , expcept that I only have one and not two ! my 7870 be a good card but I can not see pass up a 670 for a 7870 ? these new card be awesome , totally awesome and if you want to go with 3d , do not even consider amd . I do and let I tell you the compatablity stink ! not with Nvidia though ... I can state the driver be better all that stuff but I ` de sound like a broken record , go with this card and I promise you 'll not be dissapoint in the least bit
GraphicsCard	POS	5	one word : AMAZING !!! this card be really quiet and run fairly cool even under load . so far very impressed with the performance as well . I be go to buy a slightly cheaper model but I do not regret pay a little more for this one . Crysis , what use to be the bane of even high end setup , can be easily max out at 1920x1200 . benchmark for current game also look great . Have have zero problem with the card so far . installation be very easy and hassle free . the only thing to keep in mind be that it be very long -lrb- 9.8 '' or 250mm -rrb- , so make sure you have the clearance .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have a Zotac gtx 680 reference card before which would not overclock no matter what I do , I sell that card to buy a gtx 690 but come to my sens and decide I dont game enough to justify 1000 dollar on a video card . so I serach reveiw look for best gtx 670\/680 again which would be good overclocker and this one fit the bill perfectly . I would get ASUS gtx 680 dc2 but stock on those be even worse than this card , plus its a three slot design versus this which be only a two slot a plus in my book . so the performance with boost of this card be slightly faster than reference gtx 680 in game but gtx 680 score a bit higher on 3dmarks11 at least in my case . but real world performace be identical . even compare a gtx 670 overclocked to a gtx 680 overclocked performace be always very close that why I didnt mind my `` downgrade '' from gtx 680 to gtx 670 . all in all this be best gtx 670 ATM , if you get a stable one . now go on buy one .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	when I receive this video card , I have it install immediately . I be happy with the result of my resolution . everything fall into place . my computer be work great . I be also very pleased with the price .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I read many review before I pick the Visiontek ATI Radeon HD 4350 graphic card . my old HP media center 7167 have graphic chip on the motherboard and it be not up to widescreen or anything else . I buy a new 27 inch monitor and I need a basic upgrade to make use of all that new screen real estate . the card be easy to install it be quickly pick up by the old xp media center and I be off and run . I work heavily with photograph and standard screen video editing . this card work great for that , I do not game on my computer so I do not know how well it work for that , the review say moderate gaming be ok . so far great .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	first off I be use this with : i7 2600k @ 3.8 16 gig of RAM at 1600mhz 850 Watt PSU my performance in game use EVGA precision x monitoring . keep in mind these number be WITHOUT OC . with modest oc expect a 5-10 fp increase . Witcher 2 : all setting max , ubersample off - average of 60 fp . gorgeous . all setting max , ubersample on 30-50 fp . still very playable . recommend OC to increase the frame provide you want ubersample on -lrb- not a noticeable difference honestly to I -rrb- Metro 2033 : average of 40-60 fp . probably the card 's weakest performance . frame sit at about 50 , in some area it can dip below 40 . keep in mind this be everything max -lrb- aside from AAA , and 16x -rrb- . battlefield 3 : Everything max , vertical sync disabled . Multiplayer be at about average of 70 fp . some area of campaign can vary between 45-70 . very solid performance . this game heat up my 680 to about 79c , no other game take it that hot . Crysis 2 : all setting max , vertical sync disabled 45-70 fp depend on how many explosion and wide the environment be . some of the battle location in Crysis 2 be large and require lot of memory . can notice a slight decline in smooth gameplay . very demand game , give good performance . to play this game I recommend to OC . diablo 3 : this be a driver issue im about 80 % sure , all setting max ofc -lrb- not a demand game at all -rrb- yet when I first start play the game horrible stuttering and lag for about a couple minute . seem as if it need time to catch up to the normal 60 fp I get after the initial intense lag . weird . conclusion : Stock performance be respectable . OC recommend . Mine just so happen to oc alright . Make sure to disable vertical sync as this be hinder my 680 's performance greatly until I figure out i need to disable it -lrb- duh -rrb- . do not feel the need to overclock my CPU to 4.7 like I do before . 3.8 be fine . Hope this help . Feel free to ask question .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	First of all , I be not sure why anyone would buy the normal gtx 580 when this one be the same price !! anyway that be really not important , what be important be that this card be awesome . I basically purchase this so I could play skyrim on ultra and it have far exceed my expectation . I be actually play the game now with the skyrim hd mod that have even higher resolution texture and there be still no slow down . I be come from a gtx 285 and I do not think I would need to upgrade for a loong time but I guess that time have come sooner than expect . basically , if you be wonder if this card be worth the price tag , yes it be .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	bad to the bone , badder then bad ... will blow u away . . note : both power connecter need to be power up . . this barbarian rate 7.8 on window experience rating
GraphicsCard	POS	5	nice so far . replace a 128 mb 32-bit card . card work great in a all NVIDIA system , MSI mobo with a triple-core AMD processor , 64-bit xp and 6 gb RAM . the color be incredible in comparison . be play AOE Online and the color just jump out now . the game also take less than half the time to boot up . old video card need replace . note that this card do not have a fan . load this chassis down with fan at build so cooling be not a big issue . have not really have a chance to look at the specifics of the card , run temp or how it be affect the temp of processor . will review runtime performance and edit this if warrant . Works great after two day . hopefully I 'll be sing the same song two year from now .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	i buy this card as upgrade for xp sp3 . needless to say issue after insert into system , -lrb- agp -rrb- card . with the card , pc will hang in safe mode , and if a older system -lrb- mine gigabyte with nvidium chip -rrb- nvdium \/ evga driver will reprogram you mcp and break on board audio for good . Make sure to uninstall high fidelity audio driver . I go round and round on this try to fix both issue . I read with latest driver -lrb- nvidium -rrb- it break the audio in favor of the reprogram . apparently not enough space . anyway many experience these same issue without fix . my best solution be to buy a pcus sound card for like $ 9 -lrb- startech -rrb- and install they driver over the top . now all sound work again . evga support post be worthless . consider stick with previous version of evga . nvidium driver set for you own good . get better resultion when run the nvdium utility . not a bad card , but i be still stump over the hand in safe mode . I
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this card suck . sorry to be blunt but it do the driver mess up on I 4 time i blow 2 card it black screen on any 3d app and during driver update it freeze all the time didnt over clock they never touch they besides insert they in case on future mark they barely out preformed the gtx 580 and on some case the 580 finish ahead i have the same issue with previous 6 series card so maybe my board hate AMD but there performance isnt enough to warrant I keep they over my 580 super clocked and the gtx 580 isnt give any issue i think for amd i will bid they farewell until they can fix there amazing driver issue the minute there release good point - erm they look ok i guess bad point - bad driver usual amd error - bad performance consider this be mean to be the next card up from the gtx 580 i dont see it in performance my gtx actually finish higher on alot of game when i finally get a work card install after 8 hour ... , noise omg there loud i hate the gtx 580 for be loud because there loud and hot but these be loud as in off puttingly loud i also find i need to contantly run a 3rd party fan controller for they as they be get to hot and this be in a very well cool pc in a high airflow system haf x sorry for the bad review i dont usually ever give 1 star but i fix and build pc 's i build my pc it could be a board problem with amd i cant really answer that but it seem the driver be the cause i never usually give 1 star or bad review as i believe with computer component its kinda pot luck with gpus i hope you all have better luck with this card than I
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	cause random computer lock up , if there be any audio while this occur , it will loop continuously until you do a hard shutdown . even with this problem , on some occasion I can still play game without lock up . seasonic 560w i5-3450 @ 3.1 Asus P8H77-M pro sapphire radeon hd 7850 Kingston 2x4gb ddr3-1333 Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB Windows 7 64-bit Google these term : Radeon 7970 computer hard lock with sound loop 7xxx Series AMD card : freeze and lock up
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card have be the perfect replacement for my radeon 6970 I be very happy to have purchase the XFX 7970 be be a great card to have overclock factory be very fresh . game with high detail luxury the fan be very quiet . noteworthy that here in Venezuela be tropical climate and the area where I live more or less some heat and still remain in the graph idle state approximately between 36 and 38  c and full load with some title reach 65  and I have no air conditioning . in short all recommend this product be what many player seek when purchase a graph good price , excellent performance , super cool and quiet
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Easy to install and set up despite Vista . I must admit I be experience with atus product and make sure that I uninstall all of the previous ATI driver and software -lrb- no way around it ... or you 'll have problem -rrb- . the install software work fine and update itself without a problem . now my older Asus socket 754 machine with 8x agp do video and most game almost as well as my Athalon 64 x2 machine with pcie video card . a good buy if you be try to get some extra mileage out of a older agp board .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card be one of the best hd 7850s out there . it run quiet and chew through just about every game at max setting . only a couple of the most demand game drop below 60fp and even those game -lrb- the witcher 2 , Crysis , Metro 2033 -rrb- still run very well . get it . you will not be disappoint .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Got this so I could connect 2 monitor to my computer . many of the fancier card require a large amount of power . this one work fine with a 300w power supply . this be not a card for hard core gamer , but if you want to have dual monitor it work quite well . installation take about 5 minute , 4 of which be get the computer open .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	best buy hook it up and it work ! that be all I need . I be not get any display on my monitor at first and best buy tell I what to buy .
