Sandal	POS	5	I purchase a pair of these in 2004 -lrb- it be now 2012 -rrb- and the strap between the toe finally break . I would wear these for about 6-8 month out of the year . the only reason they break today be because I be out in some really sticky and deep mud and the suction from I pull my foot out finish they off . they be very durable as I have be hike with they , and have wear they as rigorously as any shoe . I just purchase a new pair . I remember the break-in period to be about 2 day -lrb- form the leather in between the toe -rrb- and they will float in water and water do not ruin the leather in any way that I can think . best of all these do not leave any black stuff on you foot !!
Sandal	POS	5	Got these for my husband for Christmas and he love they ! we be avid hiker and have always be impress with keen footwear , and these do not disappoint . good combination of function and comfort .
Sandal	POS	4	great sandal ! there be a breakin period but once you get over that they be great .
Sandal	NEG	1	I order this pair of shoe for my husband 's birthday . he be a 10w so I order a size 10.5 think it would be plenty big . my son have a pair of Keen 's and they run true to size . well I be wrong . so I follow the instruction on the shipping label I get from Backcountry -lrb- a Amazon vendor -rrb- to exchange they for the next size up . Backcountry credit the return , but do not notify I that they received\/processed the exchange . when I call to ask if the larger size be on the way , they say since it be purchase through Amazon they would not pay the shipping on the way back . so now I be out $ 12 for return shipping , no shoe , and very disappointed at the lack of coordination between Amazon and its vendor . I will not be order anything like this on Amazon again !
Sandal	POS	5	I abolutely love this product . the fragrance balance be perfect . not too strong but do not fade with the day . it be one of the few product that do not cause a allergic reaction with my skin . I wish that bath and body work would start make and market it again . bottom line : Love the product . furstrate with the company .
Sandal	NEG	1	very Disappointed . these be be return because they be NOT German make Birkinstocks , they be stamp on the bottom make in china -lrb- with USA and a number on the footbed ... would that be a patent number ? -rrb- . although the foot bed may be shape like a original Birki there be not enough height from the foot bed to the strap esp . on one sandal -lrb- ? -rrb- . they also appear to be make for the thin foot . I wear the Caribbean make in Germany waterproof sandal and have several pair . I highly recommend they for comfort and durability . the Amazon description of the Waikiki lead I to believe I be get german birkenstock sandal , make in GERMANY . I do not see CHINA any where in the Amazon description , do I miss it ? I do not buy make in China shoes\/sandals and would never ever have order these have I have accurate info .

Sandal	POS	5	these be without a doubt the most comfortable flip flop I have ever worn . it take a few day to break they in but be totally worth it . if flip flop be you foot wear of choice in the summer you will find it worth splurge on . the more they get wear the better they look as well . I be a Rainbow customer 4 Life !
Sandal	NEG	1	beside from be the wrong color , the sandal I get be fake ... not real Rainbow flip-flop ... couldnt ask for a exchange because im currently outside the US , and it would take too much time and effort -lrb- and of course , money -rrb- to send they back . be aware , look can be deceive -lrb- specially with the picture they show you -rrb- .

Sandal	POS	5	love the product , but I should have order one size larger ! of course , it could be that I be so use to my older pair of zorry , thong , sandle , flip-flop , whatever you wanna call 'em , I just need to wear these new one in a bit ! nice and snug , so maybe it be just I ! nicely make and they look like they 'll last for a long time ! I love the thick sole !
Sandal	POS	5	these sandal be wonderfully compfterble . they look great and to top it all this be a quality shoe . the soft footbed feel great and be defenetlly worth the extra cost . you should know that they run quite large and wide . one of my best purchese ! I reccomend highly .
Sandal	POS	4	looks\/feels good but the sole be a little too stiff for my liking ... get to be uncomfortable when walk around a lot
Sandal	NEG	1	today be a first and only day i put these shoe on - and it will be the last one indeed . poorly , ill design product , horrible sole that twist foot with every step - I wish I try it on sooner - now I can not even return it . really bad product . P.S. and that be not even get to the part where I will have to say that `` leather '' look like cheap plastic they use for packaging and it shine just the same , and smell ... OMG ! have to admit - that be my first ever Stacy Adams and I will happily get back to Cole Haan and Allen Edmonds - as always you get what you pay for ...
Sandal	POS	5	I buy these for my boyfriend who always wear flip flop . he have diabetes now and I have always be concern about he foot . he really like they and I be totally jealous that I do not have a pair with the soft footbed . he wear a large size and with amazon prime , I only have to pay $ 94 ! amazing Amazon.com come through again .
Sandal	POS	5	I advise who like to be sandal ... this Tonga Sandal very comfortable and too fit my foot . . and also to light ...
Sandal	POS	5	my husband love these sandal . he be a general contractor and usually wear boot , and be notoriously hard on shoe . these sandal have last for 4 year ! they be substantial enough to provide support and protection , and the fit be adjustable , with the bungie cord . waterproof , sweat proof , odor proof . they be finally wear out and I can not order more from this site , because - I CA not see what SIZE THEY be ! even if I miss it somewhere , it should be more noticeable . jeeze . find what you be look for , they have it for a great price , but I do not want to end up with sandal for decoration if they be the wrong size !
Sandal	POS	5	I do not love they as much as the previous very similar style I buy back in 2004 that fall apart , but they be just as comfortable . other than the texture change , there seem to have be a slight change to the insole as the rubber suction onto the bottom of my foot when the other one never do that - same size , same comfort , same feel otherwise . minor annoyance & I hope the adhesion stay better on this pair . I wish I have realize sooner that I could have have Birkenstock repair the other one - lesson learn . though I will always buy these again for they comfort , great traction , & wet versatile .
Sandal	POS	5	I hate wear shoe . I buy these to add to my collection of flip flop and sandal . they appear to be very well make and durable . the color and design work well for I and they be very comfortable to wear .
Sandal	POS	5	I buy my first pair of Birkenstock sandal about 4 year ago on sale at the mall . they be the Gizeh model , very cute . they eventually mold to the shape of my foot and become my default shoe ever since . eventually I wear out the sole , and now I be even wear out part of the cork , so I decide to buy a new pair . -lrb- I know I can get the old one repair , but I really want a pair of Arizonas as well -- plus if I repair the old shoe without have a new backup pair , whatever would I wear ? -rrb- when I buy my first pair on Amazon I have no idea about the different width -lrb- narrow vs. regular -rrb- . I do not even pay attention to what my old sandal have say , whether the little foot icon be fill in -lrb- indicate narrow width -rrb- or just a outline -lrb- regular -rrb- . and now all the writing be wear out in they , so I can not tell either way . I figure since I be a regular width in everything else , I 'll buy my usual size -lrb- woman 's 7.5 equal 38 in birkenstock -rrb- . so I buy a 38m at first , but that be a mistake . they be so wide on I ! and I do not buy narrow size in any other shoe . so I instead go for a 38n -lrb- which if I have read , be suitable for a-b width , and most woman 's shoe be b width -rrb- . they be perfect ! as soon as I try they on I love they . the synthetic Birkibuc material be comfortable and stylish , and the stone color go with anything . my coworker even think they be leather ! and now I can totally rock that `` hippie sock with sandal '' look . so fashionable .

Sandal	POS	5	beauty , style and venerability be write all over this sandal . you just cant seem to stop look at it even when its not on you foot . its like check out you bentley in the garage not to know if its safe but just to keep see its remarkable beauty . the quality it have in beauty it also have in style and durability . i be the type of person that love to buy new shoe all the time , but with this sandal , i guess my buying day have come to a end -lrb- for sandal -rrb- because i dont think i can ever grow tired of it , and neither will it let I go easily . i guess im stick with it for life . its a very good shoe for those that want to spend good money which be hard to come bye on a pair of shoe that will last and last and last .

I must say that this all begin with umbro and sweatpant . when I be 7-12 year old , I only wear umbro and sweatpant , despite mock cry from my peer . at some point in the 7th-8th grade -lrb- shockingly around the time I discover a appreciation of the female body -rrb- , I give in and start wear Levi 's and Boss jeans to school . Pretty much the spit image of cool . I even cut down my wearage of NBA jersey . I know , it be hard to imagine a time when the lady be not go crazy for Jerry Stackhouse Pistons jerz . give up on sweatpant kill I a little inside , and I have be die a slow death one cut at a time as I adopt another trend . so , in summation , thanks a lot all you woman out there for make I wear comfortable leather sandal , you self-righteous man-killer . anyway , in more product-review news , these thing be absolutely awful to break in . literally , it take month , and I do know the definition of `` literally '' . my girlfriend just make I throw away my 4-year old pair and buy a replacement , and my foot now look like size 13 swiss cheese . thanks again .

Sandal	POS	5	by far , the best thing I ever put on my foot . bought my first pair over four year ago and my cat immediately decide they be the enemy . he leave some pretty deep tooth mark on the side of the sole . no big deal , I think , because like most thong sandal they probably will not last that long . four year later , I be still explain why `` those sandal you wear constantly '' have feline inflict battle wound . if those sandal be a truck , they would have make it 750,000 mile before crump . do I forget to mention they be comfortable ?

Sandal	POS	5	shoe be fantastic , I be recommend they by a friend . the only thing I can say be that the size guide on amazon.com do not match the manufacturer 's one . e.g. on Amazon a UK size 8.5 need a US size 9 . however keen website -lrb- and the box they come in -rrb- say that a UK 8 be a US 9 . double check people ...
Sandal	POS	4	I buy the black premier leather double layer . pro comfortable after a couple day of break they in . durable . I have wear they for extend period in some harsh condition and be surprise they do not break . con they have a very strong paint thinner smell for about a week . if you wear they wet they will stain you foot dark black . price Mine be about 1 year old . the color be kind of fading and the leather sole be pretty mess up from water and sun damage . I still wear they because it be my only pair of sandal right now , but I be about to order something different on Amazon . it will probably be something cheaper that get the job do .
Sandal	POS	5	these be unlike other rainbow that be all leather ; these be soft foam -lrb- like the more common reef sandal -rrb- they be very both classy and comfortable .
Sandal	NEG	2	the contour bed be nice , but the strap be very tight if you have a wide foot .
Sandal	POS	5	I be impressed . I be a little skeptical about spend close to $ 50.00 on a pair of flip flop -- especially when i can go to other place and get they for $ 1 -lrb- on sale of course -rrb- . after go to a store and purchase a pair of leather flip flop i be disappoint when the flip flop get wet my foot feel like it be slide around -lrb- not good , not to mention it feel weird -rrb- . but these sandal have make I a believer . at the begin they be a tad uncomfortable because it do take a while for they to break in -- because they form to you foot . but after a while they break in and you will have they on you foot all the time . when they get wet they soak some of the water in but they dry in minute . I hope this help -- i would definitely purchase another pair .
Sandal	NEU	3	I just receive these roday and I order they a whole size larger than my fit , they run very small because they be still too snug . I have have they on for about seven hour and besides be tight the inner sole be rough on my foot , not a very comfortable sandal . as mention in other review they be hard to get on and off . they look very nice so I be hope they will stretch out so I can keep they and I may have to wear sock .

Sandal	POS	4	I order these sandal online from Amazon , and while I do not usually shop for shoe online because of the size and have to try it out first , it be a winner . the size be perfect and the fit be very comfortable . the only reason I give it 4 star be because the price be a little high ... a hundred buck for sandal that will take some beating in walk , water ... etc. . still , they look great and fit great .
Sandal	POS	5	provide for a pleasant shave with no aroma . use it in conjunction with a inexpensive black plastic shave brush holder and plastic travel case for my Gillette Mach 3 razor . Have have 20 shave so far and it appear that the soap will last for month . suggest you take you shave brush and spread it against the sink while the water be run so that the entire shave brush be wet when lather . also , I purchase a wooden soap holder which be superior to a `` cold '' metal holder or plastic holder . best part be that I have a handy ledge build under my mirror to hold all my shaving and other necessity . now , the shave item be handy and the sink surface be best use for other item . I have use a inexpensive shave soap prior to the Geo F. Trumper sandalwood shave soap but now I have find the right brand . the sandalwood shave soap be a major part in make shave a pleasant experience each day . I be sell on the soap .
Sandal	POS	4	they take a bit of time to wear in , which be the only reason I do not give they a 5 . but they be quite comfortable , mold to you foot , and give more support than flip-flop . also , I live in New York City , and my foot get really dirty when I wear flip-flop , but because these come up a bit around you foot , that do not happen .

I know all type of brand and style of sandal , and this have to pretty much be the worse . as I be out , the sandal strap come apart in a completely unwarranted time . I trip because of that , and have now scar up my foot pretty good . blood similarly get all over my sandal . now , I have Hepatitis B , unfortunately , so I have to dispose of the sandal for the safety of other - particularly , my family . not much I can do about thing when I spill my blood on they -lrb- unless I want to find some way to completely quarantine the item -rrb- . so I explain my situation to the company . what do they say ? they say that they can not do anything at all . instead , they tell I to like they FACEBOOK page because I have a chance at WINNING a pair of freak sandal . yeah right , as if I be go to advertise you junk product to my friend . never purchase from this company . they do not care about you or the quality of they product . I suggest reef 's instead - actually , I suggest any other brand .
Sandal	POS	5	wonderful flip flop . I buy they as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he love they .
Sandal	NEG	2	I buy these shoe for a 2 week hike vacation in Utah . I only wear these shoe during the trip . I be happy with the comfort of the shoe however the quality be subpar . also at the end of the day my foot really smell bad . I feel that with sandal my foot would get enough air to breath unlike full on hike boot . at the conclusion of the trip the stitch on the back strap of the shoe have come undo and be very loose . not something I would expect for a shoe in this price range . I be pretty happy walk through water in these shoe . they never come off and the grip on the bottom hold up pretty well .
Sandal	POS	5	by far the most comfortable sandal I have ever own . I first see these on some ultralight backpacker I meet , they swear by they and I have to try they . now that summer be over , and it be late fall , I find myself still wear these even now that it be cooler because they feel good and I be use to they . they really be tough to give up . any reservation I have that they look funky go away when I wear they a couple of day and get hook on the feel and how they protect my toe . SIZING issue : if they do not feel right when you put they on , you may have the wrong size . most people that buy keen find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoe , so try that . comfort : the sandal have a wide toebox so that you toe be not cramp together . the protective toe guard do the job , I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these , plus I can hide my ugly toe . it also have a little rise on the rear heel that cup you heel , but also help protect you against those people that step on the back of you foot in line . it feel very secure once it be on and do not slip . there be no strap to fool with or velcro to adjust , it have a inner lining on all the strap that look like the neoprene on a scuba suit , it stretch to fit and be comfortable against my skin . it have a no-lace closure and you adjust it once , from then on it slip on easy . the footbed cradle my foot really well . it have a little ridge on the inner sole that run behind the toe and in between you big toe and other toe . the first time you feel it , it seem like a defect . but that ridge seem to shape to my foot , give I my own custom fit . I hate to gush about this , but the shape of this shoe allow my bad foot to stand longer and walk longer . I actually enjoy run in they , and for a sandal that be a definite first with I , as they usually slip and flop all over on my foot . you can even wear it into the water like a Teva . if it get wet , for some reason you do not feel it due to the material that wick the water away . grip : it have a outer sole that be very grippy , it give good traction on sand , boulder , mud , you name it . it have not be slippery on wet surface , include a boat . the sole do not leave any mark on my floor , and do not hold dirt in the groove to track indoors . odor : it have a anti-microbial treatment so I do not get odor issue nearly as much as with Crocs and other sandal . durability : it have hold up to daily wear and repeat wetting . when they get dirty , I throw they in the sink , under the hose , in the shower or even in the washer . I wear these almost daily for 4 month straight with no evidence of wear . this include standing in line all day on vacation at theme park and scramble at the beach . like other sandal , when they be new they leave mark on my sock from the dye but I almost never wear a sock with they anyway . summary : these come in a few color and in Mens and Womens style . I have try 2 pair of tennis shoe from this company , and the footbed be similar , although the one with a suede type finish -lrb- the Targhee -rrb- look like crap in one month . it be still a great hiker , but I can not wear it anywhere else but the great outdoors . the other pair be for urban use , it be call the Austin , and it be have a really nice finish . my other favorite sandal be Rieker Anti-Stress Jens 09176 , and the Dunham Moose Fisherman -lrb- design by New Balance -rrb- . I use to wear Teva 's , and they make good sandal as well . UPDATE March 2010 : I do not know if they still make these to the same quality as the model I review here in 2005 , but it be now 2010 and my original pair of Newport h2 sandal be still in use so I can not tell . the only issue be they look a little fade now in the strap and one of the stretchy tie string lay a little crooked . but they still feel great and my sole have hold up . I still feel they be a great deal for the price , about $ 100 back in 2005 .
Sandal	POS	5	the break in period be a little uncomfortable but after a week or two these sandal be amazingly comfy . I wear they everywhere and my foot never complain . delivery be quick and the whole purchase process be easy and painless . I highly recommend these sandal for anyone seek the best sandal around .

Sandal	POS	5	I love these waterproof sandal . they float . they fall into the pool one time and do not sink . more importantly , the contoured footbed be fantastic . it make for a very comfortable fit . for extra protection and support my local shoemaker add on a quarter inch rubber sole . I have be wear the same pair for two year now . they be strong , sturdy and hold up well .
Sandal	POS	5	when I first buy the sandal I be little spectable because , have never wear a rainbow before . at first they seem little rough and within few day they break down and adjust to my fit and the leather smoothen . now I can not tell you how much I love they and I dont even want to take they off . the leather seem to be ver sturdy and the nylon sole be very strong . overall and awesome product highly recommend . also keep in mind that they run small so need to get one size larger then you wear . for example I wear sice 8.5 and have to buy 9.5 to 10.5 and fit just fine . !!!

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	its a good magazine that do not have hysterical or over hyped piece . while I do not always agree with the conclusion of the writer , the magazine do what Time , Newsweek etc do not do . Make one think . I also applaud they for be honest and have article take the currant administration to task for failing and for be honest in challenge conservative to get they act together . while William Kristol and Fred Barnes be often note as be the most notable at the magazine I actually like other writer like John Simon , William Doino Jr , Vance Serchuk -lrb- who write a great review of a book I own the White Man 's Burden why the West 's effort to Aid the rest have do so much Ill and so little good by William Easterly -rrb- , John Podhoretz , Gerard Alexander . now I know as far as subscription go the price may seem high . but I suggest you subscribe and then donate the copy to you local library . they will appreciate the gift .

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	in a era of decline journalism , National Geographic shine above all else as a benchmark for quality , and photojournalism . they have recently win multiple ellie 's the equivalent of the Pulizer prize in the magazine industry . each issue include one or two feature article from around the world . while the magazine contain advertisement , they have place ad in the front and back of the magazine so that feature article be not interrupt by a annoying gaudy ad , a practice often see in other magazine . the quality of the photo be simply amazing ; the magazine use a high quality paper to print quality photo not see in any other magazine out there . it be not fair that other reviewer , provide a lower rating for this magazine because it can be find cheaper elsewhere . National Geographic provide a lower introductory rate . however , once you get past the first year , subscriber need to pay the default rate of $ 34 .

I find it very inspirational to read the account of new business start-up and this magazine deliver with that type of story . the current issue , June 2012 , have a excellent article on Richard Branson , a entrepreneur extraordinaire . however the magazine be just as likely to profile very small new business and in some case will have `` expert '' weigh-in on what they think the prospects be for that business . sometimes there will be article on great smartphone app that be available for the person on-the-road all the time . or maybe office furniture review . you 'll find tip on how to finance you start-up and then maybe how to save for retirement . it be a great magazine for the business-minded individual .

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	I read a few review on amazon and other site about Acoustic Guitar before decide to subscribe to it . I pay they on the 1st of May 2006 and my first copy be suppose to be the July issue -lrb- which have not yet turn up -rrb- , on write to they I get a response say that I should expect it any day , well I buy they word for it , but it never reach I . it be the same story for every issue and everytime I would write to they , all that they have to say be that I should reconfirm my postal address -lrb- which be ridiculous cause I have be get they renewal notice before even a single issue reach I , and I have bring that to they notice -rrb- . I even ask they for the detail of shippment so that I could trace my subscription , to which I be inform that it have be ship by surface mail -lrb- which be ridiculous cause I have pay they for international shipping -rrb- , well then I finally ask they to courier the subscription to I for a additional cost atleast I would get my magazine , well they do just that and I have my September issue in 2 day -lrb- all this after countless mail try to prove that I be a genuine subscriber and that my intention be as clear as un-polluted rain-water -rrb- . well then I wait anxiously for the next issue , which have not yet turn up and when I loge into my account on they site it show that my November issue have also be ship -lrb- they resort to surface shipping -rrb- ; well as you can guess I have to re-request they to resort to air shipping but now it seem like they have stop acknowledge my mail ; and I keep mail they in the hope that I 'll get what be mine but to no response . so for $ 40 I have just recieve my Sepetember issue -lrb- after countless mail request for something that I have pay for -rrb- and yes renewal notice by post : d -lrb- which be ridiculous -rrb- so my suggestion to people who want to subscribe to this magazine anywhere outside America would be to rethink bout it or if they get kick out of request for something that be theirs , well then you should subscribe to Acoustic Guitar . I waste my $ 40 , which I doubt they 'll refund , cause they do not even acknowledge my email : s my acoustic Guitar customer ID no. : 789000 -lrb- a genuine subscriber -rrb-

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEU	3	this review refer to `` Cowboys and Indians '' -lrb- magazine -rrb- I purchase this `` Cowboys and Indians '' during my last grocery shopping trip when I be pass the magazine rack and there be John Wayne 's face grace the cover . this edition be a `` special Collector 's Edition '' with a centennial tribute to we guy . I could not resist . and I think that I may even order a subscription because Cowboys and Indians hold a great interest for I . I love everything to do with they . the feature article on the Duke be great , and I enjoy read it very much , but there be not too much else about this publication that would make I want to put out the money to receive it on a regular basis . the magazine be pretentious and gear toward those cowboy and gal who may be live in Beverly Hills . the page be nearly cover to cover advertisement for high style and high price goods range from land to furniture , artwork , jewelry and clothing . there be a few article , poem and story between all the schmaltz . in this issue I be interested in one about a french cowboy actor Jean `` Joe '' Hamman -lrb- 1885 - 1974 -rrb- dub the `` french John Wayne '' . I also find some great western recipe and gardening tip . when I see a article title ` Hi-Ho Silver '' , I get excite think it would at least be something have to do with `` the Lone Ranger '' , but of course it be page and page of high price jewlery . for the most part , this high quality magazine do not give I much on real cowboy . and there be almost nothing on the ` indian '' part of the title . aside from some beautiful look sculpture -lrb- and a small blurb -rrb- , one that probably be worth more then my car -lrb- I be not sure how much it cost because you have to call a number to find out -rrb- , there be not much on they at all . it be probably worth a view once or twice a year for those interested in upcome event and art fair , etc , as there be calendar with the various event . and even there , I do not see any pow-wow list . but I would not recommend a subscription if you be look for some substantial read of `` Cowboys and Indians '' happy trail ...

I be disappoint for a. not get the fall fashion issue of the one mag and b. get a expire Vogue pre-date my subscription period , short I one issue at the end of my subscription . not sure if palm off expire issue be a intended cost cut strategy or just a oversight , but I loath when company ' default position be to screw over the customer , place the onus upon customer to notice the error and decide whether it be worth rectify , and waste they time fix it . but , when I call cn 's toll free c number the agent quickly and courteously amend my account for Vogue and set the other mag to ship the Sep issue . yay ! 5 star for excellent customer service ! as far as the magazine itself , I quite enjoy sail through the page to see Vogue 's take on the current style in fashion , book , music , lifestyle , etc. . while there seem to be a certain predictability and cliqueishness in the designer they advocate , I very much enjoy Vogue 's presentation of the garment and the overall art direction . I wish there be a better content-to-advertising ratio , though .

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	while I do enjoy the article that be in this magazine -lrb- they be always well do , professional , and cover a variety of issue -rrb- , I feel that there be not enough material in the magazine to warrant the cost of approximately $ 4 per issue . the magazine be very thin and only come out 6 time a year . I feel that that they need to either bulk up the magazine or offer it more frequently if they want to continue to charge the same amount . it be unlikely that I will renew my subscription and this be almost exclusively due to the cost .

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC introduce a whole host of subject in a intelligent , thoughtful fashion : its not mean to be a Ph. D dissertation on these subject . it enlighten we to the amazing thing -lrb- both wonderful and horrible -rrb- go on in we world . if we want to delve further , we can always pick up a scholarly journal or a Ph.

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	here be a magazine that focus on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that make a competitor like `` Wallpaper '' a expensive , hit-or-miss read . what I like most about `` Dwell '' be its consistency in present interesting design from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time . even the advertisement be quite compatible to the flow of the magazine , so much so that they often look like they be part of the editorial . there be a very useful `` Marketplace '' section at the end that tell you where to get a lot of the art , furniture and accessory complementary to the design present . I have often use these helpful listing to find some interesting thing for my own place . this magazine be definitely gear toward the urban loft dweller , but I like how they highlight home with family in mind as well . individual issue be often focus on either geographic or utility-related theme , thus keep a library mandatory for future reference . the photography be superb . if you be tire of design magazine that seem to be talk specifically to designer , this be a great , reasonably price alternative for people who simply appreciate great design . highly recommend .

RiceCooker	POS	5	review be true , this cooker make fine rice . the design and construction be first rate . I think the tactile feedback of the control , carry handle , cooking pot and paddle be a pleasure . the retractable cord and folding handle make storage easy . the maker even give you the choice of attach the paddle holder to the left or right side of the cooker . nice job Zojirushi .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	when it work , this be a nifty device - compact , light , and make good rice . but three time now , I have go to retreive the rice for dinner and discover that the machine switch to `` warm '' long before the rice be cook . that really screw up dinner plan . the whole point of a cooker like this , for I , be that , follow Ron Popiel 's mantra , I can `` set it and forget it '' . with this black and Decker , i can not , render it useless for my purpose . at $ 15 , it be not worth return , but I be annoyed .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have be use this thing basically every day since I receive it -lrb- about 1 month ago -rrb- . it be perfect for serve 1 or 2 people . very reliable and easy to clean . accurate cooking and very convenient automatic shutoff as I often forget to check on what be cooking downstairs . unbeatable price . even if it be to break today I would order another .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have be debate buy a rice cooker for year , but I could never rationalize buy one . I know that ` good ' rice cooker be expensive , it would take up extra kitchen space for a very specialize device , and I be a little worried it would take a lot of trial and error to get it to work properly . my decision change recently when I decide that I need to eat less meat and process food . the most sensible way to do that seem to be to replace some of my diet with simple grain and bean . these food be really cheap , they keep a really long time -lrb- dry -rrb- , they be not heavily process , and they re-heat well . as simple as oatmeal , rice , and bean be to make , the inconvenience be still the primary factor keep I from make they a large part of my diet . when I discover that a rice cooker could be use for all of these food I be sell . I go with this model because it be on the cheaper end of `` fuzzy logic '' cooker , and because it have excellent review . I have be use it for a few month now , and I must say , my initial concern be completely unwarranted . First off , the footprint be very small -lrb- less than 1 by 1.5 ft -rrb- , plus the handle and retractable cord make stow super easy . kitchen space be a very minor issue . this model be also very simple to use ; set timer , set mode , and start . with that , it make spectacular quality white or brown rice every time . since I start use this cooker the amount of grain and rice I eat have go from basically none to over 30 % of my diet . give how much cheaper rice , bean , and oatmeal be when compare to typical food this translate to substantial savings over time . it be also more environmentally conscious to eat that way . I would recommend this cooker to nearly anybody , it be just so simple to use .
RiceCooker	POS	5	order to replace a older , mechanical timer cooker . what a difference , especially for brown and sweet rice that seem to benefit from the computerized timer . also do a great job with egg -lrb- hard boil in the steamer tray , complete with little egg ` notch ' -rrb- and for steam vegetable .

I be absolutely thrill with this rice cooker . it really be just so simple to use & the rice quality be great each time . I have to admit that I have not try use the `` fast cook '' feature so can not comment on that . if you have a small family & do not need to regularly cook more than 2 cup of rice , this should do the trick .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I purchase this cooker in the beginning of February 2011 after read many review because I want the perfect one that be within my budget . the cooker arrive quickly but the first time I try it out , it just work ok but it keep switch itself on to warm even though the rice be definitely not cook . I try turn it back onto cook but it would not let I do it so I add some water , mix the rice and close the lid , it then let I put it on cook . it do this a few time , in the end of a long wait , the rice be cook and taste pretty good . I try this cooker a few time and it do the same thing , so I contact amazon and return it for a exchange of the same machine . I think it might be defective and want to give it another chance . Amazon give I a prepaid return label for I to print out and I choose to have UPS come to my home to pick it up , Amazon send out a replacement . the UPS guy arrive around noon the follow day and pick up the return , about 10 minute later , Fed ex arrive with my replacement . I be impressed ! I immediately wash the inner bowl , steam tray , measure cup and spoon and put it to the test . I make a batch of rice , the minimum amount which be 2 cup raw rice , set my own timer and in exactly 20 minute , the rice be completely cook , nice and fluffy , it be perfect ! a lot of steam come out of the lid when I open it . I make more rice , this time make 3 cup and it cook in about 35 minute , the machine do need a little water add and mixed and back onto cook . this really work very well and I be very satisfied with it . no more cooking rice on the stove for I , I will recommend this rice cooker to anyone look for a good affordable machine .

I return to Amazon for replacement with no problem . the 2nd unit work great , and cook brown rice excellently ! it do take longer than my previous rice cooker . brown rice take from 100 to 105 minute to cook . it also require less water than my previous cooker which be a surprise to I . I hope to cook many a cup of rice with this cooker -lrb- if it continue to function well -rrb- .
RiceCooker	POS	5	my first rice cooker ! cute as a dang button . Plays I a song when cooking begin and end . small footprint , quality material , adorable logo ... and the rice be not bad either . it cheer I up immediately . Worth the price !
RiceCooker	POS	5	it cook rice perfectly , and keep warm quite well . the rice , depend on the grain , do get a little too hard above 4 or 5 hour of the `` keep warm '' function , and inedibly so after 8 hour . when this happen , I just add a little water and press the cook button again . it will rehydrate the rice quickly -lrb- much faster than have to cook the rice from scratch -rrb- and automatically switch to the warm function . I cook rice almost daily , and find that the cooking time and quality be above average . the interface be very easy to use , and do much to enhance the functionality and design of the machine . I have have the cooker for a month now , and it be still work as new . other have note that it do not come with a rice paddle holder , which may be a hassle to some , but do not bother I in the slightest . the plastic paddle be textured such that the rice rarely hang onto it . the paddle then can then be leave directly on the countertop without leave bit of gunky rice behind . as a student , I have little time to prepare meal . I find that this rice cooker make delicious meal in no time at all - like a pressure or slow cooker . I have also use it to make curried rice with vegetable and chicken . just through it all in and let it cook . I be go to go for the zojirushus 3.5 as this be the one my parent own and suggest , but I find this one cheaper and more good look . and the rice be just as good ! I would highly recommend this product to anyone choosing between these two model .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	Update 30 November 2011 : DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . as of 8 month ago , the nonstick coating on the rice cooker pot start come loose . I think nothing of it , because it be minor scratch . over time , the nonstick start flake off into the food , so I start to get nervous . I call the part people , who inform I that the part be no longer there , and be discontinue . funny how the rice cooker be still be sell at full price . in other word , after about two year , you 'll start lose the nonstick , and you will not be able to replace it . in other word , this thing have last I all of three year flat , and I can not replace something that should be a relatively simple thing to replace . what be worse be that Sanyo 's customer service be nonexistent . I can not find the number to call they customer service directly . thing be not be build like they use to be . I should have spend the tiny bit extra , and buy the Zojirushi . that be what I 'll be do next . thanks for the horrible customer service , Sanyo . I 'll never be buy from you again . other annoyance : I make brown rice all the time . the cooker always default back to white rice , rather than remember my last choice . it also take a extra 30 minute longer than rice should take . brown rice take close to 90 minute , not 45 , like I be use to . White rice take at least 45 minute . over time , the sensor must be go wonky , because in spite of my measure perfectly each time , the cooker err on the side of mushy . the number on the inside be write in ink , and not stamp into the pot . this mean that the number rub off . where do they go ? Into my food , clearly . I be very careful with my rice cooker , because it cost a fortune , and the thing be use literally every day . I only wash it with mild dish soap , and a soft sponge . it never go in the dish washer , because we have no dish washer . so now , the simple task of measure my rice be a huge pain , because I have to squint to see the number 's impression . the lid that fit over top of the pot , and as a liner to the lid of the cooker start to get gross look over the course of 3 month or so . again , they be never place in the dish washer . the entire machine be shoddily make , and I be furious at be stupid enough to spend that kind of money .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I be very happy with the Zo rice cooker . it make perfect brown , white and black rice and the timer function be very convenient . the only problem I have be make oatmeal with the porridge cycle , follow a recipe in the Beth Hensperger rice machine cookbook , which cause a boil over . the material that come with the machine suggest use the white rice cycle to make oatmeal so I 'll try that next time . the other thing I would suggest be to buy the larger , 5 1\/2 cup model instead of the 3 cup , because it make such great rice you 'll probably want a lot ! overall a excellent product , very easy to clean , attractive stainless steel finish and do not take up much counter space . would recommend to a friend .
RiceCooker	POS	5	very pleased with the perfect rice this machine produce . the slow cooker option work very well also . this machine look great on the counter and do not take up much space .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy this small rice cooker -lrb- yes , it be small -rrb- for the use for 1-2 people . I have use it several time , along with my roommate and decide to post a review . just a quick note -- it be not a true 3 cup as claim by the 1 star reviewer . cooking : just add the measure rice and water , and put the lid on . Easy , and it cook automatically and switch to warm mode automatically . set it and forget it . occasionally , its best to stir after it switch to warm mode to avoid small bit of browning -lrb- which really be not a problem for I -rrb- . the rice cook perfectly in about 25-30 minute . there be a include handy guide for various type of rice and even other thing you can cook . clean-up : this be nearly effortless thanks to the non-stick bowl . I have have no issue what-so-ever . recommendation : this rice cooker be small , so its wonderful for apartment or small space . a full size amount of rice and water make a hearty serve for 1 person . I usually have to put away left-over . it be wonderful for 2 people ! -lrb- so unless you be one of those people who can eat a big Mac , 20 Piece Nuggets , and a large fry in one sit , I would not recommend it for you . -rrb- love , love , love this little cooker : -rrb-
RiceCooker	NEU	3	nice and compact . too much water drip from rid and you need to wipe it every time you open the warmer . older version of rice cooker\/warmer have little cup outside to receive warter but this one deposit warter around rim . Wish it have better way to receive escape warter .
RiceCooker	POS	4	well , the price of this , be not that high , that be maybe why it be a little hard to cook good rice . and it do its job to steam all the vegetable . good .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	inexpensive product . cook well for about one month . first gripe be that the cooker arrive with minor damage , the kind that be cause by Amazon shipping . the void space in the shipping box be fill with a small amount of paper , which do not protect the product . the spoon holder plastic loop be crack and there be a small ding in the inner pot . item be still functional and Amazon back the product and provide a discount . however , the product stop cook properly after about one month . spend the extra money for a better product and avoid aroma cooker .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	always under cook the rice , and with no control of when its on or off , you cant control the steam , unusable for vegetable , unusable for rice , very unhappy with this product
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy this because I have a rice cooker before that be great for my family and since its just I and the cat these day this little rice cooker be just perfect . it be quick and make nice rice , I may try it with a little less water next time to make a firmer rice for fried rice . I like that it heat up other `` stuff '' too .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be a nice , basic rice cooker . I have want to get a rice cooker for some time but debate what size and model to get . the size be perfect for one or two people , and the steamer addition allow you to prep veggy and other food to complement you meal . I have be able to cook other grain and bean like quinoa and lentil , respectively , with great result . one word of advice : make sure to use the cooker in a open area to quickly clean up water splatter and to avoid steam from potentially damaging kitchen cabinet .
RiceCooker	POS	5	we try the cheaper model from the same brand and return it . this one work perfectly , especially for cooking very small quantity of rice . could not be happier , and yes , it do employ fuzzy logic when cook the rice . do not buy a cooker without that feature . and everything from this brand be usually very high quality . this one be no exception . if you be a serious cook , this be the entry level . do not go any cheaper . note that it only cook 3 cup . Perfect for those who like rice but may not want so much of it . for two people , we have find that 1 cup be enough to satisfy we craving for rice dish for two , without pump up we waistline . it be very easy to use . they give you a measure cup and you measure the rice with the line on the cup -lrb- we use 1\/4 cup per person , but most will probably want 1\/2 cup per person -rrb- , then dump it into the bowl that be include in the thing . next , add water -lrb- some people will stir the rice with they finger -rrb- and pour the water back out to rinse the rice . some of the hull from the rice will float off when you pour the water out . rinse twice , then fill the water back up to the mark correspond to the amount of rice you have in there . yes , you add water to the mark with the rice inside . put the bowl in the unit and close the lid . next you push menu to select the type of rice you have -lrb- white , brown , sushi , etc. , use porridge for steel cut oatmeal -rrb- and push start . if you want to use the timer , instead of push start , push timer , use the arrow to set the time -lrb- it start with the last time you use -rrb- and then push start . the only knock I have be that it take a \* long \* time to cook 1 cup of rice . 40 minute just seem like it be twice as long as it should take . however , because I do not know whether that be longer than other fuzzy logic rice cooker , I do not take a star away from the product . just be forewarn , it take a lot longer than cooking rice on a stove . be it underpowered ? I do not know . the flip side be that it only take 450 watt to run the thing , and so it be less likely to pop the circuit breaker if you have something else go . a little off topic , but if you be look at a rice cooker , you may want to learn about rice . here be what we have learn so far . there be three basic grain size of rice : long grain , medium grain and short grain , also know as sweet rice or sushi rice . each kind have its place . long grain rice be best for fried rice and pilaf - where the rice should not stick together because you want every grain to be coat with a flavoring . by itself , long grain rice be not that great tasting . we Americans be use to long grain rice , but wait until you branch out into other type . medium grain rice be for serve just plain rice , like as a side dish with chinese dish . it be easily the best tasting rice by itself . it clump together to a degree , make it easier to eat with chopstick . if you want the most delicious rice you can find , and you will not be flavor it , buy medium grain . it be so much better than that long grain minute rice we grow up with . finally , sushi rice be very short grain and clump like mad . it be generally limit to sushi , where you would be willing to sacrifice flavor to get better clumping , and sweet dish , because of its high starch content . this rice cooker have a special setting for short grain rice . but I find short grain rice to be too artificial tasting , and so even for sweet dish , I use medium grain rice . next , there be two basic type of rice : brown rice , which be how all rice start , or white rice , which be brown rice with essentially all of the nutrient remove . with no nutrient , white rice do not spoil like brown rice can . we have find very little difference in taste between brown rice and white rice . if you do not like brown rice , you be probably think of a exotic variety that have a deeper taste . regular brown rice you buy in the store be very nearly the same taste as white , so we have stop buy white . find Botan Calrose brown rice in a asian market , look at the health advantage of brown rice on the internet and you 'll never go back . note , there be a special setting on the cooker for brown rice , and different water mark for brown , and brown rice take about 80 -lrb- not a typo -rrb- minute to make one cup . I be sure you can find more detail on line , but that should give you the basics . Ditch you long grain rice : you 'll be amaze at how much better medium grain rice can be . and try brown rice : you 'll be shock at how close it be to the nutrient-less white rice . this cooker make all kind of rice really well . I have have it for about three year and we use it nearly every day . it be still work like the day we get it . the nonstick bowl look and act like new . the battery keep all of the setting and the current time , though my understanding be that the battery be not easily replaceable without send it back .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be a perfect rice cooker for my home , since we eat a lot of rice . very efficient and elegant style . can also steam veggy while cooking rice , so serve dual purpose . great buy for the price it be offer !
RiceCooker	POS	5	this product be great !! we use it at least twice every day and it make perfect rice every single time . whole family love it !
RiceCooker	POS	4	the instruction be not the best so first time user may use too much water . -lrb- my spouse do -rrb- in short : add dry rice to bowl , then add water , pour out , add water , pour out , etc. to rinse about 4 time . use the supply plastic tool as a sieve . then with the WET RICE STILL in the bowl add water to the bowl indicator line . do not use some typical rule of thumb like 1 cup water per cup rice . when cook , stir rice in bowl immediately . I would have give 5 star but steam and some yuck come out the top vent .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I buy a earlier version of this rice cooker a couple of year ago and have be delighted with it . base on my recommendation , two friend have buy they . and I myself just buy a third one -lrb- the new version -rrb- as a present for another friend . nothing to add to the positive comment from other in this forum . we have not check out the bread-making capability yet , but the new one make rice and steel-cut oatmeal just as well as the old one . my one small complaint be that it be difficult to clean next to the hinge . but that be minor , compare to the cooker 's overall quality and convenience . for what it be worth , my favorite everyday rice by far be Kokuho Rose rice , which cook perfectly in the Sanyo . you can buy the rice at any asian food store , and at many supermarket that have a large `` international food '' section .
RiceCooker	NEG	2	I have be use this 2-3 time a week when it finally break . needless to say , I be not happy . I only pay $ 15 for this so I guess you get what you pay for .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I grow up with rice cooker that do a poor job . so when my neice want one I try to buy a good one . so far , happy report of good rice , no boil over and easy for a single mom , five in house to feed , to use and clean . what else do we need ?
RiceCooker	NEG	1	this rice cooker arrive and nothing on it work ; no light , no menue , no clock ; nothing ! when plug in it seem that there be a master switch that be in the off position . we could not locate one and the manual make no mention of a switch . it be just dead . Amazon make it fairly easy to return and we appear to have receive a full refund . we do , however , decide to use another source to purchase a replacement .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this cooker be purchase about a month ago specifically for cooking brown rice . I typically cook a pot of brown rice each week . I have use it 3 or 4 time so far . it do a great job cooking brown rice , far better than when it be cook in a pot on the stove . less water be use than with stove top cooking . the rice come out more consistently `` fluffy '' and more evenly cook . I be experiment a little with the exact amount of water to use and think I will wind up use a little more than be recommend in the recipe supply with the cooker . the cooker be easy to use , just add the rice and water to the pot , plug it in , push one button , and come back about 90 minute later . the cooker switch to the warm setting when the rice be do . so , its not a problem if you be a little late get back to the cooker . clean up be easy . there be a thin `` sticky '' layer on the bottom of the no-stick cooking pot after the rice be remove . but , it come out easily with a little soak . all in all this be a great cooker .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love this rice cooker and have use it to cook western style white rice , brown rice , indian Basamati rice , Jasmine rice , and other asian rice , and even so-called `` Wild Rice '' and a few other and never have the burning problem other have note . sound like they be not use enough water . I do not usually need to stir it after boil start either . the glass cover make it easy to check on thing without removng the cover -lrb- and change the cooking cycle -rrb- ; it do not really seem to make much difference . it can not be beat for $ 15 and be perfect for one or two people . the con be that it do not have a timer and you must unplug it to stop the keep warm . you can scoop the rice out of the pot or easily remove the port though there be no handle on the pot so you need a couple pot holder to remove it . it shut itself off automatically if the pot we remove . cleanup could not be easier . the pot remove and wash up in soap and warm water . I have never have anything stick hard enough to require scour . of course , I always clean or fill with water in the sink after use it so it do not get a chance to glue itself to the pot . it also steam vegetable perfectly and , once again , the glass cover be a real plus . the cover fit well enough to keep the vapor in the pot . if you need more capacity , consider the 6 or 12 cup model but they have a metal cover . bottom line , the cooker be perfect for one or two people for all kind of rice and steam vegetable .
RiceCooker	POS	5	after get it I be able to easily cook sushi rice as well as accurately gauge how much rice to cook for four people without waste . I have yet to burn a batch and the item itself be idiot proof , flip the switch and go find something else to do . the warmer function work as advertise and I have be able to successfully leave the rice in for over a hour with no adverse effect . highly recommend !
RiceCooker	POS	4	I use this little rice cooker 4-5 time a week , as I eat quite a bit of rice -lrb- but not daily as some user who rate it lower do -rrb- . it have work flawlessly for several year now . I have even drop this unit hard enough to put a dent in it and it still work just fine . the non stick surface have hold up well -lrb- I be typically not very careful about non stick surface -rrb- and have a few scratch that be my fault , but the rest of the coating remain intact . the only reason I do not give this the full five star be that I do not know how they get 6 cup of cook rice out of this . if I try to cook 3 cup uncook it overflow , but for smaller amount it work just fine . I do not know , maybe I need new measure cup ...
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I recently buy this rice cooker but return it co it be very small than expect . the product info say it be a 3 cup rice cooker but please be aware that it be 3 cup of cook rice , or 1.5 cup of uncooked rice . most of the rice cooker in the market I have see describe they rice cooker in cup in term of uncooked rice .
RiceCooker	POS	5	the Zojirushi ns-lac05 3-cup be the best rice cooker I have ever use . it be not the `` first '' , but definitely the `` best . '' I recommend it to everyone I can . we have rice now at least 3 time per week .
RiceCooker	POS	5	my old Panasonic rick Cooker break down after 5 year , back than , that rick cooker cost I more than $ 50 to buy . now when I come to buy it at Amazon.com I do not expect to pay much less and can get the same function , even the look be the same . I be very happy and hope this one will last .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be nice rice cooker , especially for one person . I have have this rice cooker for 3 year now and it be such a time saver . I put in 1 cup of brown rice and 2.5 cup of water and press down on the `` on '' button and leave it . it be so simple ; now I do not to worry about burn my rice . if you have rice `` stick '' on this , try add a 1\/4 cup more water . that should do the trick . -lrb- note : if you use white rice , the ratio 1 cup rice to 2 cup water . -rrb- it also have a nice steamer , so you can steam vegetable at the same time . it have a small `` footprint '' so it do not take up a lot of room . it do the job and be inexpensive . one thing I do notice be the power cord length be on the short side , but I be very satisfied .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be amazing ! I use it constantly and would highly recommend it for the cook on the go ! I absolutely love it !
RiceCooker	POS	5	retractable cord be a plus . Easy to use and clean . very high build quality . Extra pan and lid liner , steamer tray include . I have mainly use this for rice and soft-boiled egg . I like be able to load rice in the morning and have hot rice ready when I get home from work . need to use the second pan and try some of the recipe in the cookbook . the excellent quality of this unit and the result with the rice , would probably push I purchase the Sanyo ecj-px50 pressure rice cooker available on Amazon .
RiceCooker	POS	4	its really a awesome rice cooker for 2 person . smaller one and keep the rice warm for quite some time . and easy carriable too .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have never own a rice cooker before so I find this wonderful . I just dump in the rice and water and then push a button and ta da ! it work great for my family of 4 - make just enough rice and be small enough that it do not take up a lot of space in my kitchen cabinet . however , like the one star review say , it do stick to the bottom -lrb- we just soak overnight after use -rrb- and probably do not produce the correct consistency for a rice connoisseur . but for a novice like I I find it a great addition to we kitchen !
RiceCooker	POS	4	I buy the rice cooker after debate the purchase for 2 year and shop around . pro : - make perfect rice - can make other grain in it - make fantastic and easy risotto - insert can go in dishwasher - have button for brown rice con : - release lot of steam , do not put on counter under cabinet - after use , need to sit open to dry out before put away - do not have timer , only preset button for brown rice , white rice and steam - have to use rice cup instead of normal measure cup overall I love this rice maker and will continue to use it . Hope it work for a long time !!!
RiceCooker	POS	4	this rice cooker work very well . the only trick be to make sure you use the supply cup to measure the rice -- it be not a full US 8oz measure . however , you may still want to use a bit less water than the pot indicate to obtain firmer rice -- that be we preference anyway . we find ourselves eat more rice than before -lrb- use to cook in a pot -rrb- , as it all come out plump and not too sticky . now , we be experiment with mixed brown and white to compensate for the increase . the control be simple enough , although the direction be not as clear which line to use for water . it be all easy to figure out , though .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker\/slow cooker do a great job cooking rice of every kind and work great as a slow cooker ... this two in one appliance belong in every kitchen ... you will not be sorry if you add this rice cooker\/slow cooker to you kitchen ... it will make you smile every time you use it ... Rodney ; Houston , TX
RiceCooker	NEU	3	not much to say about this one ... it make rice . it also make one heck of a mess . the steam outlet on the lid like to spew starchy water in about a 8 '' cone in front of the appliance , make cleanup a nightmare .
RiceCooker	POS	5	have grow up with a one-button rice cooker , I be look for a more sophisticated multi-functional rice cooker and find it in the Sanyo ecj-hc55 . I use it regularly for white rice and brown rice . the timer functionality make cooking rice a breeze . Rice come out consistently perfect every time . meal planning be not a issue since I can set the timer to cook the rice just before I get home . no more wait around for the rice to be ready ! what I really love about this device be its slow cooker functionality . bean , lentil and beef stew all come out tender and tasty with minimal work . the only feedback I have about it be that the instruction manual have very little on the slow cooker functionality and minimal guideline on how much liquid to add , as well as which setting should be use -lrb- high\/low-temperature slow cooking -rrb- for what item . I have have my device for 6 month and have no complain so far . clean and cooking be a breeze !
RiceCooker	NEG	2	I buy this cooker in May 2011 , and have use it at least twice a week ever since . within 2 month , the steamer tray become very warped . in addition , the cooker make a huge mess every time i use it . it do not seem to do it as bad when cooking white rice , but since I cook mostly brown rice and quinoa , it get sticky watery mess all over the place . I think we could deal with it , but my counter be get stain ! Time to replace the cooker !
RiceCooker	POS	4	the rice come out fabulous . it be also great for steel cut oatmeal . however , the timer be extremely confusing . out of 5 college graduate -lrb- engineer , phd 's -rrb- , only one figure it out . I even write the company 3 time . I own a Zojirushi Bread maker also , and that timer be straight forward . the rice cooker use a 24 hour clock , -- very confusing . if it have not be for the timer I would have give it 5 star . also , a steamer button would have be nice , but that model be even more expensive .
RiceCooker	POS	5	we have have this rice cooker for a month and have use it 4 time . I experience none of the problem that a small number of review indicate . with that in mind , this be one of those thing that perform so well that you wonder how it could be such a bargain .
RiceCooker	POS	5	we family eat rice everyday . older rice cooker be about $ 500 . so I worrird about quality since this rice cooker be so reasonable . to tell the truth , this rice cooker make same quality to my expensive old one .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I do notice in other review that this 3 - `` Cup '' rice cooker refer to a cup that be not actually a cup . turn out that it be 3\/4 of a cup . also to cook brown rice you be restricted to just 2 `` cup '' which be actually then just one and 1\/2 of a cup , which I be sorry to say be not a lot . I be also unhappy to learn that there be no setting for sticky rice . it do make great rice .
RiceCooker	POS	4	this be a gift for a friend who use she old rice cooker til it die . she tell I it work great , nothing stick , and it look great too !
RiceCooker	POS	5	so far , we have only use the unit as a rice cooker . have not yet try the slow cooker since we just take it out of the box a week ago . move in to a new house and the Sanyo ecj-hc55 look great in the kitchen . match well with the Stainless Steel appliance . the rice cooker have work flawlessly since we put it to use . so easy to operate , material look very well make . hopefully it last a long time .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I rcvd this product earlier then what be quote , which be great ! I be very happy ... until i open the package and realize it be miss the Bowl to cook product in . I contact the vendor to see if maybe they could send I one , i be willing to pay for it too . however Rachel at Black and Decker state that they no longer make this product -lrb- hence price -rrb- and that i should return it to purchase a different model as this one be know to be `` defective '' the only reason why i give this a 3 , be for shipping . other then that i can not say if this work for I or not . = -lrb-
RiceCooker	POS	4	this rice cooker be just the very size that I want as I be cooking only for myself . it cook quite efficiently and the rice taste just good !
RiceCooker	POS	4	buy this as a present . the recipient , early 20 's college student , love the practicality , ease , and convenience . Perfect rice everytime .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I get what I think be one of the better rice cooker for my boyfriend for Christmas . I go thru the trouble of have it ship in for the holiday as we be go skiing . we get it home and try it out . we be so excited . each time we use it , it make a huge mess all over the counter top no matter how much we make or how little we make . finally we give up and try this one . it have be a dream . we have make all different kind of rice , grits , oatmeal , and no fuss , no mess . it even have a fast cook set that we use most of the time - we do not plan for dinner quite well enough to do it the long way . the fast cook method be just as great . we have be creative and try some of we own recipe and make thing up . no mess , no fuss ! the instruction book that come with the cooker be not great but be creative . it have be great and so easy . we both laugh when the little tune play as you begin and end cooking cycle . it be worth a bit extra to spend to get a great product . thanks Amazon for you great policy as well . I highly recommend this cooker and we be tough on thing . it have be great !
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I love this cooker . we get it as a wedding gift and now that we have be marry 3 and a half year it stop work . I would expect it to last longer than that . we only use 1-2 time a month and only make 2-3 cup of rice at a time . go to buy a different brand this time .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Effective & inexpensive rice cooker . prepare softer grain rice -lrb- Thai Jasmine -rrb- to perfection . Black , brown , & red variety use more water & take longer to cook . spray a small amount of oil in the bottom of the removable , aluminum pot to help prevent sticking . Automatic thermostat switch to warm when do , keep rice warm for hour .
RiceCooker	POS	5	before buy this , I be use a american brand rice cooker -lrb- the most terrible experience ever -rrb- . this one be great ! cooking rice in the way I want ! the only thing be that there be too much steam leave on the lid once the rice be do .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I almost do not buy this because most of the recent review be bad . then I read they and it seem like most of they be bad because of the size . since I just want a rice cooker to make a small amount , not family size , this be perfect for what I need it for . I be so glad I do buy it . it be perfect . I use the cup that come with it to measure my rice and water , and it turn out perfect . as long as you realize that this be not a large rice cooker and be good for just 1 or 2 serving , you will not regret buy this .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I love this rice cooker . this be the best rice cooker I ever have with excellent value . make great rice every time . it come with ` Steam Tray ' as well which be `` great '' . fast cooking ! , it only take 13 ~ 15 minute to cook white rice . reasonable price for such a high quality product with Free Shipping . most excellent choice for the rice cooker and I highly recommand to everyone .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be a awesome rice cooker , and do exactly what it be suppose to : make great rice . I usually use mine to make brown rice . I use the Mahatma brown rice . my only complaint be that the instruction for the Zojirushi be cryptic and confusing . in case it help anyone else , here be how you make basic brown rice with this cooker : 1 . -rrb- one plastic measure cup -lrb- 100 ml -rrb- full of brown rice , pour in bowl . 2 . -rrb- Bowl : fill water to 1 under `` brown rice '' . 3 . -rrb- Make sure arrow on display be on `` brown '' . 4 . -rrb- Press pink `` cooking '' button . this will give you perfectly cook brown rice in about a hour and a half . if you do not want you rice to be too bland , throw a chicken bouillon cube or two in before you shut the lid and press the cooking button . I use my brown rice as a side dish , or put it in soup or even Wendy 's chili for a inexpensive meal .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Works great for I . I steam vegetable and rice at time . also I have hard boil egg in it . I use it about 3 time a week . look like a million dollar also . Easy clean too .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I give my adult child these Zojirushi rice cooker for Christmas gift last year . yesterday -- while do some holiday shopping for this year -- both of they comment about how much they love the cooker . they be very impressed with how good the rice always turn out and how easy it be to clean the interior bowl .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Works great , just like a rice cooker ought to . not a steamer , as some other review have mention . good size for we -lrb- a couple with no kid -rrb- , and small enough to fit in we tiny kitchen . also nice that it do not have pink flower on top . sometimes spit a little when open it too quickly -lrb- but most rice cooker be prone to that if they
RiceCooker	POS	5	affordable and I be very satisfied with this product . I can bring it easily everywhere I go . do not know how long will it last work .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I recently buy this beautiful cooker . Rice be well cook , do not stick to the pot . make scoop and serve easy . only thing that i be not quite comfortable be that after the cooking mode it automatically go to warm mode , which can only be turn off by unplug the cable .
RiceCooker	POS	5	Ilove my new rice cooker . cook up to 3 cup of raw rice and come out perfect everytime . in south Louisiana we eat a lot of rice so I know what good rice taste like . I do wash the rice  Oster 4722 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Steamer - red  use this for about one month so far ... it clean in warm sudsy water with no problem . just remember to NOT use metal spoon .
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I have purchase this rice cooker almost a week ago and it just completely stop cooking . first I trust the company because they be big and they produce lot of different product in different area but this rice cooker be just a total disappointment . the problem be , it just stop work and the light be not on . I unplug it and plug it back nothing change . I clean every part of it and still nothing change . it be not the only problem . it say 3 cup rice cooker , well it be not regular 3 cup , it have this small cup come with the cooker , that cup be they measurement . my point be , it can only cook 1.5 cup of rice only . when you look at the picture carefully you will see that some other brand call `` aroma '' have a bigger rice cooker and it be also a 3 cup cooker . I buy a kettle of that brand and it be work like a champ now about rice cooker clearly I make a mistake . I just pay some money for the brand . as a result of this , I only have a piece of metal junk in my kitchen now . probably people will just read the 5 star rate message and decide to buy the product . I be sure those people have no problem with this product but why would you take that risk and waste you money eventually ? my suggestion be stay away from this rubbish ...
RiceCooker	NEG	1	I buy this 2 1\/2 yr ago base on good review . now the non-stick coating start to peel off . I have handle it with tlc all the while . I have use many rice cooker before . after 5 or 6 year , they will have some kind of discolor at bottom of inner pot , but never the peel . and they be 1\/4 of the price I pay for this Sanyo product .
RiceCooker	NEU	3	good and affordable product for someone who do not cook rice frequently . for someone like I who eat rice almost daily , this rice cooker dry out my rice if leave on overnight . the cooker automatically turn on `` cook '' after certain number of hour , instead of keep the rice in warm mode like some other expensive japanese brand , where you can leave rice in cooker for a couple of day .
RiceCooker	POS	5	cook the best rice than ever ! very small and do the job for a sweet couple for they 1st anniversary !
RiceCooker	POS	4	like the color ; the bright red match the rest of my kitchen stuff . and it be just the right size for two people . not for more people . get something else if you require a rice cooker for larger gathering .
RiceCooker	POS	5	make excellent rice for chinese food and japanese sushi . convenient and easy to use . highly recommede .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker in incredible . all claim be valid . imagine make sushi rice while you be out walk , or gardening . just push a button ... it be a simple as that . no more bubble over ; no more mess to clean up . even my husband , who never cook , be intrigue . it be expensive , but life be short and I have better thing to do than watch rice simmer .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I love the convenience of this cooker but I find that it take twice as much water as the instruction call for to obtain tender , fluffy rice . the first few time I use it I put the recommend amount of water in and find the rice would burn before the cycle be complete . other than that this be a handy little product .
RiceCooker	POS	5	it be not Rocket Science ! all Rice cooker be the same . put the Rice in ... add some water ... . . Voila Cooked Rice . Easy to use Rice Cooker , just plug and play . .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be seriously the best rice cooker I have ever see . it seal when you close it so it do not make a mess . I have use it on all kind of different rice and it make they perfectly every single time and do not burn even one grain of rice . I love the little attachment to hold the rice spoon thingie . buy this if you be look for a rice cooker , you will not regret it .
RiceCooker	POS	4	I use to have a Zojirushi rice cooker before it break . this one be no be near that good with quality or the way it cook rice . however for the price it be a great little rice cooker . Easy to clean and use . I would say the only real drawback be that be do tend to burn rice on the bottom of the pot if you do not watch and stir occasionally . I usually end up add a quarter cup of water or so with brown or white rice to avoid burning . besides that work as advertise and you get what you pay for .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be the first rice cooker that I have own , so I do not have anything to compare with . however , this be easy to use and do a wonderful job in cooking rice -- perfect every time . when I first receive it , I have several question so I call the 1-800 number and the representative be friendly and helpful in fully answer my question . I would not hesitate in purchase another aroma product or recommend one to a friend .
RiceCooker	POS	5	definitely worth the time look for it , and the money spend on it . : -rrb- I could not be more happy with it . Rice cook beautifully in it , and keep for QUITE a while . -lrb- we accidentally leave rice in there over the weekend once . it do not leave a smell or get all wet\/yellow or anything ! ... though we do not eat it . -rrb-
RiceCooker	POS	5	it be probably a little bigger than what I have expect or need , but who know when you might actually need 20 cup of rice . it also have a couple of nice feature that I do not expect . there be a steam condensate catcher on the back of the unit so that when you open the lid , it do not all run down the back of the unit . it detach easily for cleaning . also , mine come with a rice paddle so do not bother purchase a extra one because it be include . the cord be fairly long ... about 4 foot so that help with versatility in appliance placement . the first batch of rice I make be a brown , red , and long grain wild rice mix . it probably could have use just a touch extra water or perhaps I over fill the rice measurement cup . the brown and red rice be perfect but the long grain wild rice could have use a extra few minute or some extra water . probably a pitfall of mix different type of rice and not a shortcoming of the machine . the only drawback that I see be that the `` steam '' tray be make of plastic . I would have hope they would make it out of metal like the main rice compartment but I be more of a grill fan than a steamer fan so I probably will not use it anyway . all in all , pretty happy with the unit so far . Pretty much agree with the other positive review . the negative review about the capacity be a strange one . it yield up to 20 cup of cook rice from 10 cup of dry rice ... hope that clear up any confusion . enjoy and happy rice make !
RiceCooker	POS	5	small and extremely easy to use , it cook rice with excellent result . it be a very good investment , the Zojirushi will last forever !
RiceCooker	NEU	3	I buy this cooker while ago and I be very pleased with it . it do ' amazing work almost with everything you through inside and almost anything I mean not only rice , vegetable and steal cut oats ; also buckwheat , bean , millet groat and etc. . so far I just try to find out all possibility you can do with logic rice cooker . you may find plenty recipe online and most of they must be adjust to you type of rice cooker ; just play with it and try even it may take to repeat it 2-3 time , you will be please with outcome . I be . the only problem I do have with mine rice cooker be partially break or badly manufacture upper steam vent cap . how I notice ? simply you have to wash all part when you do cooking ... and that way I notice something like crack and later after longer investigation I will say that molding process do not finish well . I order replacement from Amazon ; it arrive very quickly , but guess what ???? New one have exactly the same issue like the previous one . it seem to I that entire series may have the same problem , so just be aware of it . Mine do work so far even with this problem . how long it will work ? I do not know . great product , I love it ... ... it have a issue !!!!
RiceCooker	POS	4	have be use the rice cooker for a few week by now . so far we have use it for regular white rice cooking . no problem at all . it produce soft and puffy white rice every time . try once on porridge , the result be not very satisfactory . the only complaint we have be that the non-sticking coat inside the inner rice cooking pan have be moderately scratch at arrival . the reason be probably that the factory simply put the measure cup and spatula in a thin plastic wrap and place they in the cooking pan . as a result , the scratch be make during shipping . if they have use some foam wrap instead , it would not have cause the scratch . I be surprise that this top-ranked rice cooker maker would not have think of this issue .
RiceCooker	POS	5	this rice cooker be the greatest contraption I have ever own . the many feature , especially the timer setting , make it convenient and easy for I to put the ingredient in before I leave for work and have they ready when I walk in the door . the cooking pot be non-stick , so it be extremely easy to clean . the rice cooker be easy to use , which be great , because we use it about 3 time a week !
RiceCooker	POS	5	buy this to make rice for my family of 4 . it make the perfect serve size . Doe not take much room . a little small to steam veggy -lrb- we like lot of veggy -rrb- . overall great cooker for the price .
RiceCooker	POS	4	the rice cooker be a gift for a relative . it be highly reocmmen by another relative from Japan . the fine print be IMPOSSIBLE to READ !
RiceCooker	POS	5	this be my very first rice cooker and I be extremely happy with it ! it work wonderfully and be not costly at all . I be in love .
RiceCooker	POS	5	I have have mine several month now and I be very pleased with it ! we be a small family and I be able to cook the amount I need with this cooker . I be worry that I be spend too much for it but now I be glad I spend the extra money for this brand\/model . I want to cook oatmeal in it and it do the steelcut oats very well . the only problem we have be that my husband want plain oats and I keep add thing like fresh blueberry and vanilla when I start it . we do agree on the rice . we favorite at the moment be Bhutan red rice . Cook on brown rice setting and enjoy ! be sure to check you setting EVERY TIME and do not lose you measure cup . I measure the measure cup but I forget to write it down in my receipe book . I need to do that before I lose the cup . highly recommend . PS ... have anyone cook bean with rice in it yet ??
Flashlight	POS	5	please see my review on DeWalt DW 9043 bulb , as most of that apply here . bulb work great , but run very hot . Lens very hot , after 2-3 seconds touch , reflector about the same . metal hinge\/holder too hot to touch . some plastic smell in first 10 minute inspection . check again at 1 hour 5 minute -lrb- total test time -rrb- and still the same . no scorch or melt plastic . a winner ... UPDATE april27\/12 : still work great with normal drop and bang , lens heat not a issue ...
Flashlight	POS	4	early this summer I add 2-aa and 2-c maglite lead flashlight to my hurricane kit . they perform exceptionally well for I over a very stressful four day without power during and after Hurricane Ike . the 2-aa model amaze I with be everything I need to get thing do 90 % of the time . I sleep with it on my belt for four night and it be on my belt during daylight hour too . the tendency for it to fall out of its holster can be solve with a heavy rubber band loop a couple of time around the sheath to add tension . for a week after my power be restore I continue to carry that little light on my belt , because my friend or neighbor power might not have be restore and it be easy to carry and handy to have . I have bond with the little flashlight and will always recommend it . although I have since add a 3-aa maglite lead to my stable and would probably recommend that light for folk that be only go to have one good flashlight around . 12-8-2009 Update : mag-lite have new and improve they 2 aa lead light , and I just happen to have one . subjectively , it appear to be 20 % brighter than the old style 2 aa lead light . it also have a 25 % power mode which will allow it to burn continuously for over a day . the blink and SOS mode be nice , but I doubt the average person will ever have a call for those function . although the old style 3 aa led be brighter than the new style 2 aa lead , the 2 aa be handier to carry and the low power function have I convinced this be the most useful flashlight to have around . this be the most versatile flashlight I own . I have up my rating on it to five star if I know how .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have own and use mag light for year they be very reliable and put out great light . I love the way the beam on the flashlight be adjustable , you can zoom in or zoom out with ease . it let you see whatever you want with bright light . Heavy enough to be a very good weapon in a pinch . this one we keep here at the house for emergency power outage , or to look around outside at night . they be great to have around for this purpose . I also purchase the hanger to attach it to the wall in the garage . very easy to install and let you place it in a handy spot so you can get to it when you need it . we have several around the house . they always work replace the battery once a year , more often if you use it a lot . it will work for year .
Flashlight	POS	5	maglight flashlight be the best you can buy ! I pull mine from my totalled car and work without a hitch . if you use a flashlight a lot or hardly ever , this be the one to buy . -lrb- and no I do not work for the company ! -rrb-
Flashlight	POS	5	I really like this little mag-lite . it be a perfect size to keep in my pocket , or in my glove box and be plenty bright for my need . you just can not beat the quality of mag-lite !
Flashlight	POS	5	seem more powerful than the original flashlight that come as a pkg with the drill . nothing like have the pivot head !
Flashlight	POS	5	I have be use some form of the DEWALT 12 volt flashlight for the past decade . as I find the DEWALT 12 volt drill a excellent choice for residential & commercial electrical work , the dw904 pivot Head Flashlight make for a perfect companion for you lighting need . it also provide a handy load to fully discharge the drill 's ni-cad battery allow they to recharge to maximum efficiency ! a great supplementary device for all ! Update : my DEWALT flashlight take a accidental tumble from 8 foot high and a hard crash to a hardwood floor . Thought sure it be a goner but the unit come up shine bright ! tough little mama !
Flashlight	POS	5	candle mode light up a large room . the LED light be incredible . i keep one in my car and one in my house . it be just awesome . buy this flashlight and you will never be sorry .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I buy three set of these . Broke one side of one clip pull out the flashlight two day after install they in my jeep . I have two more set so I change out the broken one . same deal when I pull out the flashlight and break the other of the first set two week later , and replace it . consider the price I just chalk it up to poor manufacture . yesterday i pull the flashlight out and break the side off of another one . I will remove these clip from my jeep and look for something more dependable . I want to mount a light in my jeep , rv , and my truck , but these clip be way too brittle to be dependable . I have one brand new set still in the packaging but I will not be mount they anywhere . I expect a lot out of my tool and maglite make a very high quality , dependable flashlight . I be disappoint to see this quality do not extend to this product . the plastic be too brittle for this use .
Flashlight	POS	5	we have use these Dewalt 12 volt flashlight for many year now , what I love be they be so handy , easy to use . you can recharge the battery and the battery can be use with other tool . they be very durable , drop they many time . I 'll stress the 12 volt , it be sufficient and be lightweight , go to a 18 volt and it get kinda cumbersome to lug around .
Flashlight	POS	5	product arrive fast and protect well . I will for sure do business again . flashlight be actually brighter than my maglite 2 d cell . I will be order the lead upgrade to increase the brightness even more .
Flashlight	NEU	3	the Mag Instrument S3D016 Black Heavy Duty 3 D-Cell Flashlight be another of my past favorite that get a lot of use . now a day , there be a lot go on with the technology of flashlight . LED , Lithium battery , focus bezel , etc. . the maglight brand have fall behind a bit technologically , but be still a great flashlight for minor emergency not involve look for criminal , terrorist or signalling for a chopper pick up . the Mag Instrument S3D016 Black Heavy Duty 3 D-Cell Flashlight be perfect for a tool box but a bit too big for a deep pocket . the product be very durable and they be prove reliable . do not get I wrong . I have depend on mag lite of all size for year . but head to head , the surefire brand have quickly surpass mag lite in every important aspect of flashlight - usable light power , size , durability and weight . the mag light brand just be not keep up with the new technology . and that be too bad for we who value product loyalty . the Mag Instrument S3D016 Black Heavy Duty 3 D-Cell Flashlight be still a good value and I have several in the house and the vehicle . but they be be replace by surefire as they wear out . John Row
Flashlight	NEG	1	the shipping be as much or more than the product . I order it with other dewalt product but it be ship from a seperaye company
Flashlight	POS	4	the switch stop work in my Mini Maglite AA . I buy a replacement switch over the internet and fix it , and then I find out that Mag Instruments would have send I a new one free under the lifetime warranty . too bad . the problem be that the light turn on erratically if at all , and do not focus properly . if you open the top , you 'll see that the bulb be stick into a washer-like receptacle which they call the Upper Insulator Receptacle . it be print `` do not remove . '' if you remove it , by prying it up with you thumbnail or a pocket knife , you 'll see the switch assembly underneath , with a triangular-shaped sheet metal slide contact . remember how the slide contact go , because it be likely to fall out . if you remove the battery , you can take out the lower insulator too . that slide contact be what fail on I . instead of be flat , the radial arm be bent . I think that if I have flatten it out with needle-nosed pliers , that would have fix it , at least for a while . anyway , the `` switch Repair kit '' come with the most idiot-proof detailed illustrated step-by-step instruction that I have ever see for any piece of equipment . they even give you a plastic `` tool '' to insert and remove the switch , if you be the kind of person who have trouble tap a flashlight onto a table without lose part , or you do not have a pencil lie around the house .
Flashlight	POS	4	the flashlight be brilliant , literally . once it be charge for the first time it be unreal . and for occasional or rare usage it be extremely practical . but , if you use it for several hour a day , you may find that it take too long to get a full charge back into the battery . in fact , the only chance you can get it to fully charge be over the weekend . two battery ? how can you charge the spare battery pack when it have to be in the flashlight -lrb- which have to be in the charger -rrb- to recharge ? mag Instruments be apparently work on the problem , but to this date they do not have a rapid charger , or a charge cradle for a battery pack only . you could of course buy 2 flashlight and use they on alternate day . rather expensive though .
Flashlight	POS	5	ZBATTERY.COM be SELLING THIS ITEM for $ 19.95
Flashlight	NEU	3	have a 2 cell aa mag for 25 year , and decide to get another one and stage it at the other end of the house since power go out frequently in this area . I buy the lead think it would be ` much ' brighter and more powerful . it be not . compare both , with new battery and bulb in the old mag , the LED be only 10 % brighter with its whiter color light . it do project a perfect beam without distortion and illuminate a bit better outside . Quality be up to mag standard . supposedly , the battery last longer , but it will have to save a lot of battery and bulb to justify the cost . if you use it ` very ' frequently , it may be worth it . if not , the old style be just fine . I do prefer the slightly smaller size of the standard non-led mag .
Flashlight	POS	5	great flashlight , it remember I when I be young . I do the purchase for a experiment , hope lead maglite exist .
Flashlight	POS	5	bought 4 of these as stock stuffer and do not realize what a hit they would be . we have they tuck in glove box in we car , tool box , kitchen drawer . just small enough to fit into small storage area but not so small they get lose . the light produce be great . a very handy tool that I buy on a lark and would not be without now .
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be well build , big and heavy . just like my junk . if I hit someone on the head with this flashlight they would be a do Tom turkey . just like my junk .
Flashlight	POS	5	... it be big , it be a mag light and it really work when you need it . I purchase the sturdy clip and install it inside we key cabinet , so when we need it we just grab it , the key and go
Flashlight	POS	5	it be exactly what I be expect to arrive . I have slightly modify mine with bright pink tape so the boy at work will refrain from claim it as they own lol . .
Flashlight	POS	5	work better than I expect . Super bright , easy to hold . brightness do not diminish with use as with my incandescent . last about 5hr of continuous use on a fresh pair of aa 2500mah rechargeable .
Flashlight	POS	4	mag light be awesome . I have a 3 d-cell light for year , and replace it with this 4 d-cell . however , it be a bit to heavy to easily swing around as a weapon . buy the 3 d-cell light .
Flashlight	POS	5	can not beat it . I have have one that have be in use for over 20 year . the light be bright . the maglight be make to be use . I purchase this one for another location .
Flashlight	NEU	3	in the last decade , people have be root for this small flashlight that be always consider to be cool , with it be aircraft aluminum ` armor ' , and bright beam . this thing be once consider to be more popular than a lightsaber .  these quality stand to this day and should be consider should you buy this as a gift or lighting tool for someone . it be strong reach beam fire a fair distance in spot mode , and a moderately effective flood mode light up a room quite nicely .  now , with these kudos , there be some thing to keep in mind when buy this light :  unless you get silver\/puter or light blue , this black knight can be easily lose in the dark if you do not have it on . also , the fact that it be a heavy duty metal do not help it be chance from a fairly tall fall . this thing be not shock absorbent . maybe it be case be , but it be innards be not . and to top it all off , this flashlight be more thirsty for battery than a 5 litre gas guzzle Mustang . after a good half hour , it dim a litte , but a little too soon .  so , what do I recommend above the Mini mag ? two great recommendation : the Energizer double Barrel ` xenon ' flashlight , with it be great look , and better battery life . the xenon bulb be also brighter than the mag 's ` t-bulb ' . another great light be the Rayovac AA Industrial flashlight . now , this flashlight do not have the same distance reach as the Mini mag -lrb- in spot mode -rrb- since this light be build with a ` wide spot ' , that act like a super -lrb- and I mean super for a aa light -rrb- minus spot light , and maybe not at long distance , but at least for light up ... the WOODS ! I find this to be the best light for when you be lose in the wood . if you be one of those people who walk a lot at night , especially near any forest and wooded area , then the Rayovac AA Industrial light be the one-if you be not interested in a l.e.d light , which should be you first choice . you would probably think that a Rayovac AA flashlight would not be powerful enough for to light up the thick of the wood in the night and twenty foot in front of you ... well , guess again !! you would better get one and try it out . it be output be nearly as bright as a 2d maglite in flood mode . really ! I carry it everywhere with I -lrb- knapsack -rrb- . and mega shock resistant !!  so , hat off to mag for a great run , and for make a cool and powerful light with a few self defeat fault .
Flashlight	POS	5	I once put my 3d cell black maglite flashlight on the closet shelf and i be leave the room and i hear a thud i go to turn on the flashlight and to my surprise it still work
Flashlight	NEG	1	I expect more from this light have purchase many of Streamlight 's excellent product . the so-called beam be ringy and irregular and the bulb dont last very long . too many other modern light available that be a quarter of the size and weight that easily out perform the mag Instument line .
Flashlight	POS	4	this flashlight be great it last forever ! sturdy and bright , it also doesnt suck the life out of battery like many do . it take 2 double a battery . i have a red , light blue , purple and a black one and they have be amazing to have when camping , around the house and in the car . small and lightweight yet extremely durable . make out of metal that doesnt rust and the color be beautiful , i hope you enjoy
Flashlight	NEU	3	Maglite be a good flashlight for the price . but what I want more be , 1 . smaller & lighter 2 . much more brighter & focus beam 3 . lead instead of halogen\/xenon for longer life . only after see `` wolf-eye pilot whale 1000 luman '' , I realize that led can be so brighter . there be a lead upgrade option available for magcharger by  terralux tle-300mr ministar30mr 600 Lumens LED upgrade for Mag Charger Rechargeble Flashlight  see it in action video -lrb- ... -rrb- also all Magcharger model be have same luman , only difference be the ac\/dc\/europe charger , spend some time search that . also check  Stream light 76811 polystinger d lead flashlight with 120-volt ac , black  top bright led flashlight be also available from these brand -lrb- some of they available in Amazon -rrb- wolf-eye ultrafire eagletec fenix .

I take it on trip without even bring the charger . it be one of my favorite tool . the battery do not leak and it be ZERO trouble . I recommend this light and battery pack for everyone . portable , rugged , dependable and very useful .
Flashlight	POS	5	this review be for the 3 aa battery lead version -lrb- currently amazon have the title and description of the aa lead model mix up -rrb- . I have no less than 10 maglite in several size and color ... this one blow they all away ! to give you a example of how bright it be : in candle mode this flashlight be brighter than my fluorscent camping lantern that use 8 size d battery . this thing totally outshine comparable maglite more than 10 time its size . every automobile should have one of these in the glovebox , and no camp-box be complete without one .
Flashlight	POS	5	I have have this system since 1991 and my flashlight stop work , so I check and order this one and now both maglight that work flawlessly . the charger on my 1st one finally go south only take 14 year . if you want dependability and longevity do not think about it , just buy it !
Flashlight	POS	5	the sp2201h be a lead upgrade of the former incandeecent Mini Maglite . the lead beam be very bright and adjustable by turn the head .
Flashlight	POS	5	to start , I be a tradesman who have to carry he lifeline on he belt . not only on the job , but I be also the unnofficial handyman of this apartment complex . every time I even move to take my workbelt off , it seem to be a signal for a neighbor to bang on the wall say something be on fire or will not open all the way . and the Mini mag be the universal flashlight . it be sell everywhere , include this fine site and even family store , and despite its legendary quality and design , be at the most ten dollar with include holster . I prefer the classic aa design , where CA not you find aa ? I have use one of these on my belt for about four year . it be a excellent tool , and I have never have one wear out on I . the bulb , however , be the Achilles heel . the rest of the flashlight be military , police and trade quality , for civilian price . but these dang bulb go orange after a couple week and last a couple month of casual use . I be consider shell out forty buck for a small led , just to save the money on bulb . then , walk through a sport outlet , I pass the flashlight section . and next to the usual Mini mag with holster , which I own close to six of , be a Nite ize accessory design for this same flashlight . a lead bulb . now , I have see these online for about twenty to thirty buck , and this be a ten dollar flashlight ! but this one just sit around on a shelf be eight buck , about a buck less than the flashlight 's shelf price . what the heck , I get one . to quote another review , my trusty old mag be now a state-of-the-art torch , with nearly triple battery life of the old bulb . and led , as all mag-hater know , do not burn out or even go out when bump . so , for a total of twenty buck , you get a american-quality led beam that compete and plain out whip fifty-dollar import with plastic casing . I would not recomend this flashlight if there be not there be a way to fix its biggest flaw . just get you hand on this led adapter , and put it in like you would the standard bulb . replace the mirror reflector , and stomp the old bulb into powder . you will not be need they , ever again . there be also a combo pack availiable , for the same price , that include a push-button adapter if you have ever wish you could tap a red button on the end instead of twist it on and off . I have not try it , but it come with the LED , and for eight buck ? and hey , the flashlight itself come in six different color . these thing be easily replace if one get bang up or you room-mate\/girlfriend draw all over it with sharpie while she be on the phone . I have have these work perfectly even whenhe asing h be through Hades and back , but some prefer a more formal-looking flashlight . just take the lead out and put it in the new one , those bulb last forever . and now , so will this flashlight .
Flashlight	NEG	2	I still do not understand how Maglite can make such great flashlight , and yet make a horrible single cell key chain flashlight . I have use maglite product for year . they be incredible sturdy , and yet beautiful to behold ! I have try to tell they , but they do not seem to listen , or care . I keep buy they , think they 'll get better , but they do not . like other have say , they be not very bright and they use power rapidly . and they flicker . I really do want a small flashlight for door lock and the like , but this definitely not it . DO BETTER , MAGLITE !
Flashlight	NEG	1	these be cool once , but by today 's standard the light output be very poor . my surefire and Arc flashlight be much brighter , more robust and a fraction of the size .
Flashlight	POS	5	I carry a aa mini-mag I have a 3-d cell in EACH car and a 2 6-d cell in the HOUSE one upstairs and one by the front door for self defence .
Flashlight	POS	5	these hold extremely tight . I hang flashlight vertically and only use one clip per flashlight . it be plenty secure .
Flashlight	POS	5	to start , I be a tradesman who have to carry he lifeline on he belt . not only on the job , but I be also the unnofficial handyman of this apartment complex . every time I even move to take my workbelt off , it seem to be a signal for a neighbor to bang on the wall say something be on fire or will not open all the way . and the Mini mag be the universal flashlight . it be sell everywhere , include this fine site and even family store , and despite its legendary quality and design , be at the most ten dollar with include holster . I prefer the classic aa design , where CA not you find aa ? I have use one of these on my belt for about four year . it be a excellent tool , and I have never have one wear out on I . the bulb , however , be the Achilles heel . the rest of the flashlight be military , police and trade quality , for civilian price . but these dang bulb go orange after a couple week and last a couple month of casual use . I be consider shell out forty buck for a small led , just to save the money on bulb . then , walk through a sport outlet , I pass the flashlight section . and next to the usual Mini mag with holster , which I own close to six of , be a Nite ize accessory design for this same flashlight . a lead bulb . now , I have see these online for about twenty to thirty buck , and this be a ten dollar flashlight ! but this one just sit around on a shelf be eight buck , about a buck less than the flashlight 's shelf price . what the heck , I get one . to quote another review , my trusty old mag be now a state-of-the-art torch , with nearly triple battery life of the old bulb . and led , as all mag-hater know , do not burn out or even go out when bump . so , for a total of twenty buck , you get a american-quality led beam that compete and plain out whip fifty-dollar import with plastic casing . I would not recomend this flashlight if there be not there be a way to fix its biggest flaw . just get you hand on this led adapter , and put it in like you would the standard bulb . replace the mirror reflector , and stomp the old bulb into powder . you will not be need they , ever again . there be also a combo pack availiable , for the same price , that include a push-button adapter if you have ever wish you could tap a red button on the end instead of twist it on and off . I have not try it , but it come with the LED , and for eight buck ? and hey , the flashlight itself come in six different color . these thing be easily replace if one get bang up or you room-mate\/girlfriend draw all over it with sharpie while she be on the phone . I have have these work perfectly even they have be through Hades and back , but some prefer a more formal-looking flashlight . just take the lead out and put it in the new one , those bulb last forever . and now , so will this flashlight .
Flashlight	NEU	3	after buy these as a replacement for a old pair I have that break a while ago . I be very skeptical due to the bad review . but I be sick of my flashlight not be available at the garage door where I originally place the clip . so I plunk down my money , re-install the bracket and now very carefully -lrb- know how they will break again -rrb- put my maglite in place and remove just as carefully . Buyer beware but still a useful tool .
Flashlight	POS	4	bulb work Perfect in my Milwaukee M12 Flashlight . just wish bulb be brighter . still cant figure out why Milwaukee dose not make a bulb .
Flashlight	POS	5	my husband and I buy we first maglite almost two year ago , and its still work like its new . he use it nightly at work . he can get about a week to two week usuage out of it before he have to charge it . we buy the second for home use because we get tire of buy battery for the small maglite you get from wal-mart . we love we new rechargable as much as the old one . I buy it about a month ago and use it about once a week . I havent have to charge it once . the only complaint I have have about maglite be that the button on the first one have fall off but it be still work fine other then that .
Flashlight	NEG	1	once upon a time these be consider top of the line , mostly by law enforment that actually prize these light because they be sturdy and they could bash people over the head with they . they be prize more for they club like appearance than the actual crappy beam that come out of they . over the year I have discover numerous company that actually try to make a better light , Surefire , Streamlight , Pelican , and Arc , to name a few . these newer light use newer technology , new xneon bulb and no bulb in the case of the new lead base light . it be too bad that maglite have be leave in the stoneage of lighting product and now from a competitive standpoint must use other means of compete . from recent observation mag have choose to try to simply place lawsuit against they competitor to try to destroy these new line company out of existence . sorry for the rant folk but no discussion of mag can be do without mention they extremely distasteful business practice . so I say to mag , spend you money on research and development , improve you now pitiful light and let you product be you ultimate statement of company direction . fire you vast team of legal expert who continue to be a blight on the civilized world and welcome competition which you apparently find so repugnant . so for anyone who bother to read this , frequent the company I mention above for superior lighting product and boldly step into the 21st century of lighting and see how delightful it can be . the bonus be you can still use you old maglite as club and weapon which they be design to be .
Flashlight	POS	5	get to the point . it be a great accessory to have . I own one in the past . I recently purchase another one through true value\/promax back on 11\/18\/09 . after I do not receive what I order by the estimate delivery date ,12 \/ 10\/09 I contact Promax and they tell I it be deliver on 12\/2\/09 via FEDEX . I be give the customer service number for FEDEX and when I call they , they tell I the package be deliver on 12\/3\/09 . I think I would save money by order the Maglite online , but instead I be rip off . a representative at Promax state that since my order be only $ 106.00 , they be no signature require and my package be leave at my front door . in that case , I would have do better by place the $ 106.00 on the porch with a sign that say , `` take I , I be FREE '' . the people at Promax be give I the run around in resolve this matter . I just want to inform other consumer on my experience Promax . I have call and leave message , and no one be return my call in regard to this issue . regardless of how much a item cost , there should be some alternative to make sure that we as consumer get what we pay for with we hard earn DOLLARS . thanks Promax , for show so much concern toward you customer , Joseph , who will never do business with you company again . what a rip off ! again , this item be a great accessory to have . I guess I will flag down a snap on Tool Truck to pay another $ 150.00 to get this great accessory in which I need it to perform my job .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a really good light . it stay in the charger so it be always ready to go . focusable beam be a great feature . it be very bright .
Flashlight	POS	5	it be a Maglite , and it live up to the reputation of its american brand . it be solidly build and work well . this thing will probably last a lifetime . scroll through the color option because you may be able to find the same flashlight for nearly half the price in a different color . I purchase it with the `` MAGLITE AM2A016 Mini AA Flashlight Accessory Pack '' so that I could attach the red filter and use it for stargaze .
Flashlight	POS	5	if you want a super heavy duty flashlight that can also be use for self defense then this flashlight be for you !
Flashlight	POS	5	these clip be great . make out of a very durable plastic , they be very easy to install . I mount these in both my truck and now have very easy access to the maglight and now free up room in my glove box .
Flashlight	NEU	3	I like the light - it put out a great beam , it do not weigh much , it seem to be sturdy enough ... the problem I have with it be it tend to turn on when carry in a pocket . to turn it on , the head be twist . when walk around with the light in a pocket , which I need to do for my work , movement tend to turn the light on . I have run through numerous battery this way , and of course , battery always need to be replace at the most inconvenient time .
Flashlight	POS	5	at less than $ 10 deliver , these Dewalt bulb be a fantastic value . they be the direct replacement bulb for my Porter Cable 12V Xenon flashlight . the Ace Hardware store that I order from have super fast shipping . the reviewer that give one-star because of the shipping cost must not value they time or think anything of bure up gas try to located these at a mega home improvement center .
Flashlight	POS	4	some reviewer disparage these clip because they be plastic . I have to look closely at they to make sure they be plastic since they feel very sturdy to I . I attach they to the frame of my futon in a couple of minute and now feel better know that I have a light handy without even have to get out of bed . I plan to get another set , or two , to mount a light near the garage door and maybe even in my suv .
Flashlight	POS	5	the name Maglite have always be know as the industry standard . do not waste you time on cheap flashlight , spend the money on this min lead flashlight and you will always have a dependable flashlight on you . woman can use in they purse or bag , especiall at night to see car lock or house lock or problem at night . this flashlight be not only for man , keep it in you office drawer in case of power failure or at home or in you car .

Flashlight	POS	5	receive the order ahead of expect time , accurate and in order . thanks for the good service .
Flashlight	POS	5	receive my mag Lite quickly . I find this product excellent . well construct and long lasting . I wish that battery last longer , but we can not have every thing . great size for walk my dog at night .
Flashlight	POS	5	buy this for my in-law . I have have the same light for over 15 year . I do go and purchase seperately the led bulb for it though . it do help with the battery consumption . I highly recommend this upgrade .
Flashlight	NEU	3	the AA Mini mag be a reliable tool for everyday use . here be the pro 's : it be compact size and the sheath allow you to carry it anywhere you go . if you drop it nothing will happen to it -lrb- unless of course you abuse it -rrb- . the lens scratch easily , but they be inexpensive to replace . the lightbulb be also inexpensive should the original blow out . the head quickly adjust from spotlight to floodlight , and it be quick conversion to candle mode make it a unique tool , especially during a blackout or natural disaster . its compact size also allow you to use it in tight space such as check the back of the refrigerator , wash machine , or in you car 's engine . the con 's : the light be not too bright , it just do not hack it if you be picky about illumination . of course the xenon bulb be better than the type you 'll find on a $ 1 Dorcy light , and many other cheap flashlight . but if you have use Streamlight , Inova , Surefire , or even the new 3-watt led maglite , you 'll be disappoint by its brightness . if you be willing to spend some buck , you can upgrade you Mini mag to a 1 Watt LED light , which will provide twice as much light . you can also buy the switch that allow you to turn it on at the bottom with a simple click . there be some pretty cool thing out there that can turn this tough , reliable flashlight into something better ! however , it be still not appropriate for law enforcement , military , security guard , etc. . it would be more appropriate for everyday household use , walk the dog at night , or light up the room you in during a blackout . this flashlight usually range between 8-15 buck depend on where you get it from . if you spend about $ 25 buck -lrb- which would be roughly the same amount you would spend to upgrade the minus mag -rrb- , you can buy yourself a 2aa battery , 3-watt Mini-Mag Lite with a holster that will surely not leave you disappointed . it be light output be tremendous , and it be sure to blind you or anyone who look directly onto it . it also travel further . it also save battery life . it be not you average led-light , it be better and at a affordable price . so you might want to give that other flashlight a try if you be picky about the brightness of you flashlight . Hope this help !
Flashlight	POS	5	I have own a dozen of these small lite over time and they be great as hunting light to get to the tree stand as well as go from the garage to the house late at night . awesome power from such a small light .
Flashlight	POS	5	sturdy , bright and well build . Maglight have a eye for quality . the 3c cell be a nice size .
Flashlight	POS	5	great product , have be use mag lite for year and finally wear out my AAA light . but happy to pay the price to have more year of good service .
Flashlight	NEU	3	I order a flashlight for Father 's day and expect it in a new package like the maglite c cell flashlight I order but it be wrap in newspaper . the piece that detach at the bottom be in a old ziploc bag . the flashlight look pretty new but I have never receive a package like that . I will be order another flashlight soon but I wonder how its go to be package .
Flashlight	POS	5	3 pound , extremely durable , bright ... what else could you need ? caution : this item be strong enough to be consider a weapon , either as a lightsaber or beater stick , it will fracture skull with little force . rapist beware ...
Flashlight	POS	5	this be the highest quality flashlight on earth . not just this model but the entire product line . I think Mag Instruments have perfect the flashlight . you could spend you whole life buying and toss cheapo flashlight 's or buy a Maglite once it be that simple . Dont blow you money on plastic junk Stick with mag they really be the Mercedes Benz of flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a great flashlight . Maglite make a very tough light and hold up well to anything you can throw at it . this be the second one I have have . the only reason I get a new one be the battery leak in the old unit and I could not get they out . I would highly recommend this to anyone .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be one product -lrb- apart from a swiss Army knife -rrb- that will never fail you . go ahead and buy it .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I be very dissappointed with this item . do not last a day . the Streamlight Adjust-a-Clamp be vastly superior . stainless steel construction and it be CHEAPER too . my current streamlight set have be in heavy constant use in my truck for over 15 year . the rubber have wear off a few time but it still hold my flashlight ! customer who be unhappy with the mag instrument product should check out the streamlight clamp .
Flashlight	POS	5	maybe you be a cop or security guard , maybe you be a guy who live in a place where you can not carry a firearm , maybe you be just someone look to fill the ` use of force ' void that exist between shooting someone the bird and shoot they between the eye . any way you look at it , let not beat around the bush here ... anyone buying this light be do so for one reason only , the ` light ' aspect be totally secondary to that one reason . it be a club that double as a flashlight . so , how do we judge it on the objective criterion ? as a whuppin ' stick , it definitely work - so well that some ` kinder , gentler ' Police Departments do not even allow it anymore . Kind of a bummer that they discontinue the thinner 6c ; bar find one second hand and pay a real scalper price for it , the 5d\/6d be the pretty much the only ` in production ' option in the mag line for a `` big defensive flashlight '' but that be ok . unless you have very small hand , the 6d be perfectly controllable . it be big . really , really big . the light itself be about 19.5 '' long - a foot and a half - in total . when weight down with cel , it be heavy , too . you will want to tread lightly with this , as it definitely would generate enough striking force to fracture a skull , break bone . be damn sure you be legally justified to use it , if you ever do use it . you can hurt someone with it . it be do cut a pretty intimidating profile . walk around with one , it be almost as if you be carry a bat . in some situation , this be ok . in other situation , where draw attention to yourself be not the desire outcome , you would definitely want to leave this one home -lrb- in this regard , probably worth note that give its weight , this be essentially a two handed club . I be a large guy who have decent enough work strength - swing a six d-cel flashlight with one hand be pretty slow go . slow enough that you might risk you adversary grab on to it -rrb- as far as brightness , it be bright by ` bright enough ' standard . not bright enough to impress flashlight geek who obsess over marginally relevant technical detail on internet forum , plenty bright for average Joe to use for real world stuff . unless something have change , these be still ship with incandescent bulb , which be not anywhere near as bright as a good led -lrb- for example , the Maglite 3d lead torch be significantly brighter -rrb- ... of course , let we not forget the reason we buy this in the first place . the ` flashlight ' part be a secondary consideration , or , a primary consideration inasmuch as it allow we to carry it around in place where the same thing absent the flashlight function would be consider a unlawful bludgeon or club . if you want to juice the light aspect up to balls-out bright , terralux make a upgrade that turn the thing into a portable sun ... it be pricey - three time the cost of the light itself - but it do add a monumental upgrade in brightness -lrb- 700 lumen -rrb- , which can be quite practical . if you shine that into someone face , they be either turn away , or , if they be really determine to keep advance , they 'll be do so blinded and\/or with they eye close , at which point we option the ` club ' functionality . I do not throw around the five star rating too often , but this be a five star piece . right now , as of October 2010 , with Amazon free shipping on purchase over 25 , you can get one ship to you door for right at 25 buck . be this worth 25 buck ? hell yeah .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a excellent flashlight . it have good battery life and be extremely durable too . it be a perfect size for everyday use . but if you buy this flashlight you should buy the lead upgrade . it isn `` t as bright as the original bulb but it be almost as bright . this be a really durable flashlight as i say before . it have even survive be throw up into the air and even be run over by a bike ! so this flashlight be worth the money .
Flashlight	POS	4	First of all , for those wonder , this be not the latest revision of the Maglite Mini lead . as of this write the latest Maglite Mini LED be 77 lumen while the one I get from Amazon be 69 lumen . I know 8 lumen be not a huge difference but I be a sucker for have the latest version . the flashlight it be self be nice . I keep it in a black organizer so the silver stand out nicely . this be the first flashlight I have use and own that have different mode . honestly , about a month ago I do not even know flashlight have become so technologically advance so the mode be very cool . especially low power mode . you do not always need all 69 lumen so save some battery life be a plus . overall , it be a very nice flashlight especially for the $ 14 I pay for it . at it be normal advertised price there might be better option out there that be brighter and smaller . do I mention this flashlight be almost 7 '' long ? it be pretty big . on another note , do anyone know if the aftermarket crenelate bezel and window breaker for the incandescent Mini Maglite will fit on the lead version ?
Flashlight	NEG	1	buy this 2 week ago , base on my excellent experience with Maglites , BUT this one do not live up to Maglite quality . unlike the Mini mag it be fashion after , Maglite must have change something as the rotary on\/off switch die after 2 week . guess i 'll try the competition ... . .
Flashlight	POS	5	get she as advertise could not even get they at Home depot around here but Amazon have it in stock
Flashlight	POS	5	i have a mag lite and love the quality . . the firm click of the off\/on button be satisfy and a sign of suberb craftsmanship ! i do wish that maglite would make a head lamp model and\/or a tripod option to assist in hand free situation ! other wise the cost be minimal if one consider that these flash light will survive we life time ... i would bet that the designer at maglite will soon offer we a hand free model , but til then i will light my way with maglite ! thank you for reading and consider my opinion !
Flashlight	POS	5	the mini maglite be the perfect size for a purse , briefcase or tote bag . the adjustable beam allow for illuminate large or very small space . this versatile item be standard issue for all of we employee .
Flashlight	NEG	1	I have not receive it yet , they say it should be here around 6th of November . that be 6 week , come on . nothing and I say nothing have ever take this long to get here and I will never buy anything from this store again . if it do not arrive by then I want my money return at once . the light bulb I oerder come with in a week . oh yeah they come from another store . John Ekstrom
Flashlight	NEU	3	maglite use to be the standard for good flashlite . not anymore . this one have poor illuminationtion and use battery like there be no tommorrow
Flashlight	POS	5	this flashlight be worth the price . it be well make and durable . I would definitely recommend this to a friend .
Flashlight	NEU	3	Works as advertise , the only downside be that I hate to let my kid use it as the cost of the battery make for a very expensive flashlight .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a top quality , rugged and bright flashlight with bulk . this bulk can be a asset or drawback , depend on you need . pro : a -rrb- very ruggedly make , with aluminum construction . this light can be drop in mud , rock and water without destroy it . the only drawback be that the regular bulb can break , render you light useless . however , I have never have a bulb break . if break be a concern , Maglite make a lead version , which can not break . b -rrb- this light be very bright . c -rrb- the on\/off switch be on the side , near the front . it be rubber shield to eliminate water and dirt get into the light . it be not easy to accidentally turn it on , but be easy to find in the dark by feel . d -rrb- the light take 3 d cell , easy to find and last a long time . e -rrb- police have routinely use these maglite as a combination baton and light . while , thank goodness , I have never have to use as a baton , it might add to a more secure feeling in certain situation . f -rrb- the light be a good `` thrower '' . that be , it project a tight beam a long distance without disperse much . there might be a better throwing light available , but it will undoubtedly cost much more . g -rrb- the light can be focus . it can throw a tight beam or spread the light out more to the side ; very adaptable . con : a -rrb- the light can be heavy if carry for long period on you belt or in you coat pocket , etc. . b -rrb- the light be large and bulky to carry . this could also be a advantage , so it depend on you need . conclusion : all in all this be a high quality light . it have few substitute if you be look for a bright and rugged light with some bulk . if you want a bright light in a smaller package , the Maglite xl50 might be a good option :  maglite xl50-s3016 lead flashlight , black
Flashlight	POS	5	buy this light along with they fluorescent lamp -lrb- which die after 2 month -rrb- . this light work as expect . very happy with it .
Flashlight	NEU	3	i have a ryobus flashlight that need a new bulb & the replacement bulb be the dewalt one -lrb- that be what home depot tell I -rrb- . but i be turn away when i see the bulb be $ 8\/pair ... i think what a rip off ... so i go online & i see makita have a 18v bulb -lrb- p\/n a90261 -rrb- that be similar to the dewalt . and the best part be it be $ 3.50 \/ pair & i find at a website w \/ a $ 0.01 shipping ... could not beat that . i get the bulb last night & it fit in my ryobus flashlight w \/ out a problem . whaooo whoooo !!!
Flashlight	POS	5	I love my Mini Maglite ! I have have two of they in the last 8 year -lrb- one grow leg and walk off , so I replace it for $ 10 -rrb- and never have a single problem with either . these be make by maglite and be a step up from they Solitaire AAA keylight -lrb- another great light -rrb- . the Mini run on two aa battery and have a tiny 3 volt `` bi-pin '' type bulb . the battery be store in the flashlight 's body and be access by unscrew the tail cap . the lens be make of polycarbonate , and every mating surface of the light be seal with rubber o-ring , which make it resistant to dust , moisture , and waterm and I can validate this . I have use it in the rain , mud , snow , and fog with no problem whatsoever ! I think it be interesting that the Mini do not have a traditional on\/off switch . you turn it on by twist the head assembly to the right or leave , and you focus the beam the same way from spot to flood . one of the thing about the Mini mag that I really like be that you can use it as a candle . if you turn it on and keep unscrew the the head , it will eventually come apart . the bulb will stay on so you can use the light as a candle by stand it up on the tail cap . I have find this to be invaluable when I need a desk light or reading light but do not want to get out of bed to turn mine on . the Mini mag be quality instrument . the body , end cap , and head be make out of high quality aluminum that be be computer machine from a solid billet of aluminum , which make it very strong with tight tolerance for precise fit between part . the bezel that secure the lens assembly and reflector be also make out of aluminum that have be laser etch with the Maglite logo , and the head have raise grove cut in it for a better grip when twist the head to turn the light on , off , and for focus the beam . it be also fully anodize inside and out for maximum corrosion resistance in saltwater environment . the body be also cut with a pattern in it for a better grip when you hand be wet or slippery . despite the grip , I do have it slip out of my hand several time . it feel solidly build , hefty in the hand , and I reckon will be unlikely ever to break , even if you abuse it . I be weary of the head fitting snugly to the body because there be a little play in it , but it seem to be seal off good and be not let water or dust in . Mine have be drop more time than I can remember , leave on all night and day , step on , sit on , kick , toss , dunk in water , coat in mud , bury in sand , with no problem . you could run this over and it would be fine ! the lens do get scratch up and the anodization be wear very thin , but it be still good to go . the light output be impressive for such a tiny bulb . I be surprise at how bright it be . it would throw a decent amount of light at least 50 foot and illuminate a small room with the candle function . I can not say how many time I have reach for it and turn it on and it always work . in over 7 year I only have to replace the bulb once -lrb- it come with a spare bulb in the tail cap that be secure in a plastic holder -rrb- . the battery life be pretty good . mag advertise 30 hour of run-time and I can validate that . with fresh battery I use it for over two month of occasional use before it start dim . the best part about these be that you can get a lead conversion for they . Maglite make a lead version of this , but the aftermarket conversion work much better . I install the TerraLux lead kit , and it be worth every penny . it cost more than the Maglite itself , and be more expensive than the mag lead , but it be well worth it . you get triple , maybe quadruple the light output and longer battery life to boot . it be a fantastic investment , and for those who want a physical on\/off switch -lrb- I do -rrb- , terralux make one of those as well . pro : high quality make from aluminum not plastic nearly indestructable water resistant Compact Good light output adjustible beam good battery life easily upgradable con : none ! a great light that will always be there when you need it , plus it be a Maglite so it be a company you can trust will stand behind its product . if you want a inexpensive flashlight that will last you a very long time , look at the Mini Maglite first .
Flashlight	POS	4	there be better light out there . of course they cost more money . I have 5 or 6 of these float around between car , night stand , wife night stand etc. . they work great , last a long time , and if something happen to they -lrb- battery leak , run over with tank etc -rrb- you just chuck it and buy a new one .  that say , when you be look for a flashlight that you have to rely on and you do not want to carry 3 or 4 with you , I would look to a lead flashlight . led do not burn out very fast , runtime on battery be WAY longer . my personal favorite be the Inova x5 . 5 led , 20 hour runtime on one set of battery , waterproof , and brighter than a mini mag by far . it just cost 3-4 time as much , which be why I have one of they instead of 4 .
Flashlight	POS	5	I strap my mag on the rollbar of my Wrangler , hide behind the strap for the shoulder seat belt . no one notice so it be safe and it do not use up precious storage for a wrangler . I have use mag for year and know I can count on they when I need they . Great , dependable , tough product provide the security a flashlight should give .
Flashlight	NEU	3	my mag instrument s4d016 black heavy duty 4 D-Cell Flashlight get a lot of use . this be the one -lrb- and the 6d-cell -rrb- light that lot of law enforcement carry . it be effective as a flashlight and as a tool if the use of force need to be escalate in subdue a bg -lrb- bad Guy -rrb- - order give with confidence and with commanding voice , physical force include night stick or mag light , side arm , shot gun -rrb- . there be a lot go on within the technology of flashlight recently . LED , Lithium battery , focus bezel , etc. . the mag have fall from grace a bit technologically , but be still a great flashlight for police \/ emt INCLUDING look for criminal , terrorist or signalling for a chopper pick up . the Mag Instrument S4D016 Black Heavy Duty 4 D-Cell Flashlightt be very durable and they be prove reliable . but even the police and emt and military be switch over to more tecnologically advanced product and technique to go along with the new equipment . . they have to . they life and the life of other depend on the best equipment available . and for a long time that be Mag Light . do not get I wrong . I have depend on mag lite of all size for year . but head to head , thesurefire brand have quickly surpass mag lite in every importantant aspect of flashlight - usable light power , size and weight . the Mag Instrument S4D016 Black Heavy Duty 4 D-Cell Flashlight be a good value and I have several in the house and the vehicle . but they be be replace by surefire as they wear out . John Row
Flashlight	POS	5	I have couple of 2-aa , 3-d cell and a 5-d cell maglite for 20 year . they never fail . the only time it fail be when the battery melt and glue everything shut inside . it be impossible to clean it out . I also have a bunch of led flashlight from the old 1 watt to the newer 3 watt lead . the led be much brighter but blue\/white\/cold in color . so , the LED be not dense enough . it will not reach far . the led go about 20-25 foot max and everything be fuzzy . the maglite on the other hand , be warm\/orange in color . it be like a fog light that can go up to 50 foot . it be not as bright as the led but it be much much clear and sharper to see what be at the far end . I use the led mostly for go behind the desk\/under the table kinda work . but for real work like go under the crawl space or go up in the attic , I have get to use the Maglite . the lead just will not cut it . I replace the bulb with the newer xenon light bulb . this light bulb make the Maglite much better . it be brighter and whiter but at the same time be still warm\/orange in color . so , it be still dense enough to see far and sharp . beside use the Maglite as a flashlight , you can also use it to crack and smash anything you want and it will not compliant . 5 star !
Flashlight	POS	4	use inside a jeep tj to hold maglight . Works as advertise , have hold up well . have to fill in review with more word
Flashlight	POS	5	MAGLITE flashlight win I over about four year ago . Maglites work in rain and snow , be very bright and last a exceptionally long time . I originally get my maglite 6-d flashlight as a back up to my surefire 6p lead , however , the Maglite soon win I over . now I use th surefire as a backup to my maglite ! great flashlight , would recommend .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be my first maglite and I be very happy with it . even after know the length of this flashlight , I be still surprise by how long it be when I receive it . build quality be top notch , just as I be expect from a brand like Maglite . if you be after a more practical-size flashlight this be definitely not the one for you . however , highly recommend if you want the biggest and baddest flashlight around .
Flashlight	POS	5	this light be pretty siick ... i buy it bcuz i be go to camp in like 2 week ... and i hear that mag-light be a good brand so i decide to get this ... it look nice and the light be a nice white beam
Flashlight	POS	5	while I have run into a flashlight that be slightly more waterproof than this one it be almost three time more expensive . in my humble opinion value be a major component of any design . for this reason , this flashlight rate a 5 . grasp this in you hand and you be immediately strike by its design in strength and careful manufacturing . the adjustable beam , which spread or focus the light expand the usefulness . narrow for read a map late at night or wide angle for walk down the lane . a spare bulb -lrb- a old concept that seem to have get lose until now -rrb- increase the likelihood that you will have light when you want it . mag take a simple product , add important feature and then use quality material and method to produce it at a very attractive price .
Flashlight	POS	5	this the second replacement battery pack I have purchase . what set this one apart be the price . most place want $ 40 , or more , for this battery pack . I still feel that a $ 10 to $ 15 price range would be fair . but , pay half price do make I feel better . beware beware beware I do not use the flashlight everyday , so when I try it for the second time , just past the thirty day return period , I find that it be defective . guess what nobody would warranty it !
Flashlight	POS	5	I never know how much my old battery be lack until I receive this new battery and give my flashlight a new lease on life . Amazon also have a excellent price .
Flashlight	POS	4	be use this light for nearly 5 year for all kind of work in attic or under house . I have always be able to rely on this thing for difficult to spot wire or for work in a dark closet when mount panel for security system . the rotate head be also very handy for that perfect angle when work in odd location . I do wish it have a clip or hook that would attach to 2x4 's in the attic . that be the only reason why i only give it 4 star .
Flashlight	POS	5	this be a great flashlight ! the price from Amazon be half of what snap on tool charge . if you be older or have trouble see in dark place , this be the flashlight for you . one word of caution -- do not drop when hot !! you will be replace the bulb .
Flashlight	POS	5	great product , only problem be there be no spot to attach any type of string to the bottom like I have see on other model . keep this in mind when purchase the accesory kit .
Flashlight	POS	5	this a great light , especially if you already have some other Dewalt tool that use the same battery . the head pivot to give different lighting angle and with the battery it stand up on it be own with no problem . no more buy disposable battery for flashlight .

I have small hand and the ring be petite , have a low profile , be extremely comfortable and exactly what I want . I would recommend this ring if you want something small and understate but still amazingly beautiful .
Jewelry	POS	5	I decide to write a review for this product as I have see many review for item by this seller that be fairly contradictory . I be a avid fan of sterling silver and personally own over 100 ring -lrb- purchase from various seller and artisan -rrb- . here be what I can tell you from my extensive experience : substantial sterling be expensive and shiny finish scratch no matter how careful you be . take that into account , I order this item with some trepidation - it seem to be awfully cheap for real sterling , and it be very shiny . the sterling be somewhat thin , however it be not as thin as I be expect it to be . it do not bend with normal usage . I even squeeze it onto a larger finger and then do some tug to get it back off and the ring do not bend . that be a decent thickness for the price . I also wear many ring at the same time and have not find my ring to have scratch the surface of this one -lrb- yet -rrb- . I have purchase ring from major retailer -lrb- when they be on sale they be about the same price as this -rrb- and the sterling be much flimsier and the surface easier to scratch . add to the fact that it be well-made -lrb- solid , the scrollwork be not stick out and the stone be not loose -rrb- , the detail charming , and the stone genuine , I can honestly say that I have NEVER FOUND A BETTER DEAL for a genuine sterling silver ring ! I love the ring so much that I have order several more and some other item from silver insanity . I be extremely satisfy with they product and find they price excellent -lrb- reasonable and appropriate -rrb- . these `` armor '' ring be a bit smaller than what some people may have be expect but that be why you should read the specification carefully and also the weight listing . I find that the 3 `` armor '' ring that I have purchase all reach to about 1 centimeter behind my middle knuckle -lrb- as in , do not go past my middle knuckle -rrb- . one note - the size seem a tad bit small - if you be a half size , order up ! Hope this help !

Jewelry	POS	4	if you wear silver as I do , then a pewter ring look odd on you finger , as it be dull gray and not shiny whatsoever . this ring fit well and look fine , but the finish be dull and the ring be super heavy ! I have receive compliment on it though , and I like it , but you definitely know you have it on !
Jewelry	POS	5	this be a great product . it be just as describe and in excellent condition . great seller to do business with . thanks again .
Jewelry	POS	5	I buy one expensive platinum + diamond ring for my wife that we afraid it would get damage from wear it everyday , but instead she would wear it on special occasion . on the other hand , the sterling silver cubic zirconium ring would be okay for everyday wear . it have fool some of my wife 's friend into believe that it be a expensive one . I do not know it would fade\/tarn like other reviewer indicate . Time will tell , but for the price it probably worth it . only one thing , I wish the seller would send\/mail out the ring asap since we know how much a $ 4.99 shipping cost would be for this light weight item be ... similar seller charge for only $ 2.99 for similar item ... then the seller should keep in mind of the buyer expectation and you know what I mean ...

Jewelry	NEU	3	I get the ring today . it be deliver sooner than I have expect , which be good . the ring look nice . the stone be clear and sparkle . the band width be as describe . however , there be only four prong , not six prong as be describe . I do not mind that it only have four prong , but I expect six prong from the description . also , the stone be loose a bit . I can twist it and see it move . the stone could have be set tighter if it be six prong rather than four . I hope the stone will not fall off any time soon .
Jewelry	NEU	3	excellent product . i love the look of the dead , decaying bird scull but im unhappy of the shipping time . for some reason shipping from Las Vegas Nevada -lrb- where its ship from -rrb- to South Lake Tahoe , California -lrb- destination -rrb- take longer than a item come from Indiana . and I order the Indiana product a day later than this product .

Jewelry	NEU	3	I want a pink ring , and for the price , I could not argue with this . it be a nice ring , it be pretty and it fit well . I immediately think when I take it out of the box that it be plastic and not metal . I can not really attest to the quality of the band , and I do not have a problem with metal so I can not tell you there either . the stone be a clear light pink and it be pretty . I would not call it really sparkly . it have a nice , clear look , but it do not have a ton of sparkle . but . . what do you want for $ 8 ? I be not head over heel , but I be not disappointed either . it be nice for the cost . if you want something cheap for everyday use , or something for a younger girl that will look pretty but be cheap , this be a good choice . definitely classier than what you find for the same price at a big-box store . -lrb- Update -rrb- the ring be cute , but be careful with it . I be not sure what happen to mine , but I come upon it one day totally crushed and bent , and unable to be fix . the metal be just that thin and cheap that it can easily be bent out of shape . I have never have that happen before to a ring . I 'll be replace it with a different pink ring . lower from 4 star to 3 .
Jewelry	NEG	1	this ring arrive yesterday and I be go to send it back immediately . when I open up the little plastic bag the stone be not even in the setting anymore . it apparently come loose from the setting during the shipping process . I think about glue the stone back into the setting , but when I examine it closely I be very disappointed . the stone be extremely thin and cheap look . the ring be also much smaller than the photograph make it appear . I think it look like a ring for a young girl and not for a woman . needless to say , I be not happy with this purchase and I will not be order again from this seller anytime soon .
Jewelry	POS	5	I normally review watch but this will be a first for a ring . the ring arrive in a nice little silver box with a baggie inside the box . inside the baggie be the ring . with a lustrous shine , you pull it out of the bag ; examine it - love the layered brick design ; and then put it on the finger . since this be a spinner aka worry aka prayer aka stress ring - I 'll try not to wear out the inside portion that spin like the one 's I have do with that be make of stainless steel . since this be a recent purchase I can not comment on durability at this point . hopefully it 'll survive my life . thank you for a excellent product !
Jewelry	POS	4	love this ring ! I buy it with the skeleton hand ring and this one be just as awesome . it be big so if you like dainty this be not the ring for you . probably more direct towards man , but I love it . it be very unique and take I a while to find anything like it . this be the only place I find a ring like it .
Jewelry	POS	5	I love this ring ! I wear it with my wedding band that be platinum and everyone beleive it be real !

Jewelry	POS	5	i like this ring . the super polish on it make the tiger eye really stand out and move around . because of the design of the setting , this ring do sit a little sideways on you finger . i happen to like the look . it be different . very good value .
Jewelry	NEG	1	when the ring arrive it be not all the nice salmon\/peach coral color you see on the picture . it be bright red and I return it immediately .
Jewelry	POS	5	this product be beautiful , I like it more in person . I wear everyday . fast delivery and safe packaging as well .
Jewelry	NEU	3	I buy one of these ring for my husband as a engagement ring . -lrb- I ask he , I figure it be only fair . -rrb- after four year together he still be very happy with the ring but we now have to replace it . while the strength of the tension have hold the stone perfectly the garnet have chip in 3 place . my husband do not do a lot of manual labor kind of stuff . he job be a software programmer and he never work on car or other type activity that be rough on jewelery . we will most likely not replace he current ring with the same kind .
Jewelry	NEG	2	the ring its self be nice . but the thing that confuse be I be why these ring be size 10 or 9 or lower . i get the biggest size to be safe -lrb- 9 i think -rrb- , and the stupid ring look like it could barley fit a 5 year old . its as if they expect you to have skeleton size finger . theres no way the ring be a size nine if so then a size fize accord to this ring be the radius of a pencil
Jewelry	POS	5	one of the simplest but very elegant look black Onyx Rings I have see in a long time . it look so cute worn on the index finger . nice ring for the money .
Jewelry	POS	5	I love this ring ! it be interesting to look at , and I like the design . I have not take the string off for fear of not be able to figure out the puzzle . maybe one day I might try it , but I like it so much I do not want to chance it now . ship fast . 9\/26\/07 - update SOLUTION the following be a step by step solution for a thin band , four link puzzle ring  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Puzzle Band ring -lrb- size 5,6,7,8,9,10 -rrb-  I e-mail silver insanity and ask for the solution to this particular ring , and this be what I receive . I do not edit any of the information send . it be a bit wordy , but it work . I hope this help everyone . 1 . you will notice that the four band be similar , but upon closer inspection there be slight difference . two of the link have a simple peak to they , and the other two link have a dip and a peak . look carefully to identify each link . at this time , single out the link that have a simple peak , with 4 etch carve into it . -lrb- the etch may be faint , compare the two simple peak link and choose the one with more groove -rrb- 2 . once you have find the simple peaked link with four groove , hold that link only , let the other link dangle . turn the ring so that the top of the peak be point away from you . there should be two link dangle from the link you be hold , with the fourth link dangle from those two link . 3 . while still hold the four grooved link , take the other simple peaked link , which should be the one dangle from the bottom , and bring it up to meet with the one you be hold . you should now be hold the two link together , the band of the link together , and the point of the peak point outwards , opposite of each other -lrb- it should look like a diamond -rrb- 4 . continue hold the link together with you thumb and pointer finger -lrb- you will need you other finger for the next part -rrb- . 5 . you will notice that you now have the two ` dip and peak ' link dangle from the two link you be hold . Select the link on the right -- this be trial and error , sometimes the correct link will be on the right already , and sometimes you may have to pass the wrong link over the top of the ring in order to place the correct link in the proper position . the two dangle link be very hard to tell apart , so you will discover which be the correct one for the next step by follow these instruction : 6 . after grab the dangling link on the right , turn the link so that the peak and dip face you . look at the link , notice the dip and peak . you want the link that have peak that point like arrow to the LEFT , then the right . -lrb- the other link have peak that point like arrow to the RIGHT , then leave -rrb- 7 . when you have find the correct link for the next step , hold it taut against the two simple peak band you have be hold between you thumb and forefinger . the band of those two link should now be rest against the LEFT point peak of the select link , and you should adjust you hand so that you be hold that link on you pinky , taut . 8 . with you free hand , grab the last remain link . turn the link so that the peak and dip face the top of the ring -lrb- you should be hold the ring upright the entire time -rrb- bring the remain link towards the right , and overlap it with the link you be hold on you pinky . the easiest way to do this be to imagine you be try to put the other link on you pinky with the one that be already there . if this be do correctly , you will still be hold the two simple peak link between you thumb and forefinger , and they will form a diamond shape . you will also be hold the other two link on you pinky , they should form a figure eight , with the other two band pass through the center . 9 . at this point , I usually change the position of my hand . now , hold the figure eight together with you thumb and middle finger , try not to disrupt the other one too much ! try to maintain the diamond shape in some way , hold it however you be comfortable , in a way that will enable you to continue with these instruction . 10 . Select the link on the top , closest to you . -lrb- part of the diamond -rrb- spin the link around so that the peak fit through the figure eight -- also , make sure that once the peak be inside the figure eight it also pass through the band of the other part of the ` diamond ' . when the link have be spin , and pass through the figure eight and the band of the remain link , fold it downward , so that it be flush with the two link that form a figure eight . 11 . well , you make it to the last remain link ... congratulation ! all you have to do now be carefully spin the last link so the peak fit between the peak and gap of the already mostly assemble ring -lrb- just spin it , no need to do anything fancy ! -rrb- once the last remain link have be pass through the ring , fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the link . 12 . enjoy you puzzle ring !

Jewelry	NEG	2	the ring arrive in a very nice american Pearl box with polish cloth , velvet bag , and guarantee policy . presentation be very good . the good : the setting be well do . the diamond have good fire and be ` white ' enough to compliment the white gold . they be also color-matched well to each other . they be not exactly the same size on close inspection , but be too small to really notice from more than a few inch away . the bad : the pearl be not black at all like most south sea pearl and have no green overtone . it be medium gray and look nothing like the pearl picture on Amazon or American Pearl 's website . this be also not a 18k ring , it be clearly stamp `` 14k '' inside the band . if the pearl color be not enough to make you return it , the lesser quantity of gold than advertise should be . conclusion : overall it be a very pretty ring even though the pearl do not look anything like the pearl you be expect to receive , nor like 90 % of south sea pearl . the setting be really nice . it be not 18 karat gold make this ring about $ 80-100 less valuable .

CableModem	POS	5	this product be easy to install and result in double my connection speed with Comcast . if you network be wireless , you may need a new wireless router in order to get the higher speed . I pair the Motorola sb6121 with Cisco Linksys ea3500 router because my old router be not compatible with the new modem .
CableModem	POS	5	very good Modem Works Great , if for any reason , you have a very low upload speed after install , call you cable company to adjust they signal for work to the modem docsis 3.0 , -lrb- a lot of cable company still have they signal to docsis 2.0 -rrb- that just happen to I , but after my cable company do the adjustment the modem work perfect .
CableModem	POS	5	I get this install in place of my mot sb5101 ; my isp be Comcast . after test it appear that the -lrb- ... -rrb- yield different result on download from 6mz to 16mz depend on time of day . dsl report test give about a 40 % speed increase . so , it do appear offer superior speed to the sb5101 . also , the error rate on packet reception be significantly lower .
CableModem	POS	5	I be pay 7.00 a month for a old beat up router not worth 5.00 to buy from charter cable I do a lot of online gaming with 2 people always on it . to every one surprise the internet begin to run with lightning speed first time I have ever see my speed that fast then I speed up my system from 15mpb to 30mpb this modem will most surly make a major differnce in you system performance if you have older and outdated modem !! thanks for buy the most current model !! Charles
CableModem	POS	5	just want to send a warn out there for people like I who be not tech savvy with modem - I find out the hard and long way that this modem will not work if you have Comcast internet and telephone . it only have a cable jack and a Ethernet jack -lrb- the Ethernet cable be the cable that run from you computer or router to the modem -rrb- . for Comcast voice , you need a telephony cable modem that have a cable jack , Ethernet jack , and a phone jack . I discover after a visit to fry that 99.9 % of the cable modem do not have phone jack - 3 of the 4 salespeople I speak with have never even hear of one have a phone jack . however , the best buy that have a Comcast installation center in they do sell the special telephony cable modem -lrb- brand be Arris -rrb- , but it cost $ 150 . I be sure I could have find one cheaper online , but I be pretty do with it by then . the rental fee for the Arris modem through Comcast be $ 7 a month . it would take over 21 month of rental fee to pay off the $ 150 price , and by then something new would be on the market . so I just bite the bullet and rent from Comcast . Hope this info save someone else a day of frustration .
CableModem	POS	4	to keep it short , I can not find anything wrong with this product , in fact it be easy to install and easy to use . I have use it for a month now and it have not give I any issue . I would recommend it to someone look to use it with a 15mbp connection .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this about a month ago because I be sick of rent one ffrom Comcast for $ 7\/month or whatever they be ; plug it in and it work , no issue to date . internet do seem somewhat slow ... though I do not think that have anything to do with modem specifically .
CableModem	POS	4	I recently get Comcast Internet and want to own my own cable modem instead of pay Comcast every month to rent one . Everything go well have to contact Comcast with Mac ID and serial # but after set everything up my modem keep cycling through and the Comcast guy say my modem would go online and then go offline . he think I have a faulty modem and they be go to charge I $ 50 to send a rep out to check if it be a line problem or a modem problem . luckly I google the problem and find that these modem sometimes have a problem with receive too powerful a signal from the cable line and say a attenuator or cable line splitter would do the trick . so I have a line splitter that take the 1 line and split it into 3 seperate line and then it work perfectly with a less powerful signal . Everything work perfectly now and the modem be great but I be surprised Comcast do not suggest to try this since it be a issue that be know .
CableModem	POS	5	this work great with Comcast . I be very pleased with the speed , performance and the easy installation . the size be just right . I hate big and bulky equipment .
CableModem	POS	5	use a infinitv 4 tuner with Windows Media Center -lrb- Windows 7 -rrb- . before add the bda-s1 booster : signal level -26 dbmv snr 26 db after add booster : signal level -6.9 dbmv snr 30.4 db we have intermittent freezing & block on some channel ; those problem disappear when we add the booster . I recommend this for anyone who have low\/marginal signal level and snr .
CableModem	POS	4	when you install this modem , if you be replace a Comcast rental , ensure you have the MAC -lrb- CMAC or HFC MAC -rrb- address handy , and call Comcast first & tell they you want to provision a new modem . after several hour of try to use they webpage that come up , I have to call . also , ensure you have the correct MAC address ; for example , a `` d '' can look like a zero -lrb- `` 0 '' -rrb- w\/those tiny letter , which be my only complaint on this modem so far . otherwise , the modem seem to be work great for I -lrb- though I do have to reset my wireless router and then reboot the modem to get the 2 to work together -rrb- . the modem work fine with my Ooma telo box to provide VOIP ... if you be use comcast-provided voip\/phone or will be , this modem will not work I think ; you need a telephony modem .
CableModem	NEG	1	just get this in the mail . horrible connection and super slow compare to the ARRIS I be rent from Comcast for $ 7\/mo . I be consider keep the rental and suck up the fee just to get decent internet . ca not even stream video from Youtube \/ etc without it buffer every 5 seconds . sad .
CableModem	POS	5	when Comcast decide to do they digital transition , one of the dta would not activate properly . the only advice Comcast offer be to `` remove any splitter . '' that be not really a option without lose cable service to most of the house . after replace the cable run to the problem dta with new cable , I be now able to activate the dta but the signal be still degrade to the point that several of the channel be unusable . internet search indicate that the problem I experience be not uncommon and suggest a amplifier . of course , Comcast will send a tech out to fix , but it be at homeowner 's expense . I be not willing to pay they to fix a problem they create . install amplifier -- quick and easy . there be a comprehensive installation sheet , but it be not really necessary since amp input and output be well mark . before installation , signal strength at the DTA input be about 15db with a s\/n ratio of about 25 . after install the amplifier , the signal level be 1.5 db and the S\/N ratio be 37 . Works great and I do not have to pay Comcast to fix the problem . my only complaint be that I have to do it in the first place . my cable service be not break before they implement they transition . after , I have lose service to two tv -lrb- unless I want to pay they extra for additional dta -rrb- , I have a rat 's nest of wire behind each of the tv where I install dta , and there be no particular improvement in service -lrb- unless you count several additional channel which be completely worthless . -rrb- but this be not about Comcast -- it be about the amplifier . five + star . solidly build , as you would expect from Motorola . if you be have problem after Comcast `` improve '' you service , I highly recommend you take a look at this solution .
CableModem	POS	5	I get a letter from Comcast tell I my modem be out of date and I need to upgrade it . I do some research , find this modem which be on Comcast 's list of suggest modem , and order it . after it arrive , I swap out my old modem with this one , call Comcast customer support , and within 15 minute I be back online . it be easy to install and I be happy with the purchase .
CableModem	POS	5	I have Comcast xfinity . I disconnect my old modem , connect this modem , and then `` re-plugged '' my wireless router . a Comcast installation screen appear on my laptop when I open Explorer . you need you Comcast account number -lrb- on you bill -rrb- , I follow the step , and it work great . I do not need they , but I be keep the number on the bottom of the box .
CableModem	POS	5	I replace a old Linksys modem with this modem and have nothing but good word to say about it . Works great !
CableModem	POS	5	Easy to review -- look at m and COX website to find certified compatible modem -- zoom be the only one -lrb- at the time -rrb- that fit the bill . excellent out of the box experience , no connectivity issue , plenty of through-put . I would buy another , but -lrb- knock wood -rrb- I 'll need to do so !
CableModem	POS	4	this replace my Comcast router with no issue . it be not difficult to set up . acticate online folow the process discribe in the first review . Easy seal , this thing be fast !!!
CableModem	POS	5	the Comcast rep give I a list of cable modem that work with Comcast and recommend Motorola as a brand . it work perfectly on the 1st try . we have only own it a month but no problem to report as of now .
CableModem	POS	4	this solve all the issue I have with my isp . I be call at least once a week because of outage . I plug this in and activate it in a few minute and have not have any issue . well worth it .
CableModem	POS	4	the device be easy to unpack and the cox support guy be great . we have it run in about 5 minute . one problem that prevent I from give it 5 star - the print on the box and device for the MAC address be way too small to read . if I would not have have a magnifying glass , the 5 minute install would have take a hour .
CableModem	NEG	1	I have be use a Motorola sb5120 -lrb- mostly happily -rrb- for a couple of year and plan on upgrade we network start with a new DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem , the Motorola sb6121 . today I just try install my second modem from Amazon after the first give I the cycle-on , cycle-off problem some of the reviewer have mention . sadly the second one be the same , at least for I . I have to conclude either there be 1 -rrb- a batch of defective modem out there , or 2 -rrb- it really be not compatible with Comcast cable in Portland , or . there be no point in order a 3rd . Comcast do not give I any assistance - as per usual , they first suggestion be I buy the ` wrong ' modem -lrb- tho they do not exactly say that , and the website give it all high mark -rrb- , and they attitude be one where I imagine the service tech greet I with `` hello , this be Comcast , how can I help you ? let see we record indicate that you first name be `` Moron '' correct ? yes , I think so ... '' -rrb- -lrb- to be fair , he really do not say that and be rather quite pleasant , he just could not offer any meaningful help . he do even call back to check if I work out my problem -rrb- so apart from my Comcast minus rant , at this point there be no way I can do better than 1 star for the sb6121 though I wish I could . on the flip side , `` thank you Amazon '' for you awesome return policy . this one will be back home with you in a few day .
CableModem	POS	5	hook it up and then spend 10 minute on the phone with Comcast to get new MAC address register . Everything work great . hard to believe I have be pay Comcast $ 5 per month for year when I could get essentially the same equipment for a one time $ 30 fee . the old modem go back to comcast later today .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this to replace a old DOCSIS 2.0 Linksys cable modem\/router . it be easy to install ! I do not even need to use they technical support . it have not give I any trouble since the day i install it . I would certainly recommend it if you be look for a new modem .
CableModem	POS	5	here be my story : I live in socal with Time Warner Cable as my provider . I have 1 line come to the house that be split 3 way : 1 -rrb- strongest signal directly to the modem ; 2 -rrb- one line driectly to the cable box\/dvr in we family room ; 3 -rrb- the third line be split use this Motorola signal booster to 4 other tv . it work perfectly . no signal loss at all to the 4 other tv . prior to this I be use a 3 way splitter I find leave over in my attic . it send the signal to 3 tv but when I add the 4th -lrb- pip on my Family room tv -rrb- the signal degrade alot . add this and now all work perfectly . the power source for this unit be awesome . I have the splitter mount in the attic and run coax to a convenient outlet for power . I highly recommend this if you be splitting signal to multiple tv .
CableModem	NEG	2	I buy this modem after my Motorola Surfboard keep drop out . this one be more stable for the first few month , but after that I notice a sharp decline in my upload speed -lrb- it go from around 2mbp to .15 mbp -rrb- . after fight with my cable company for a few week and try just about everything I could think of to fix the problem , I finally decide to try switch it out with my old surfboard modem . this fix the issue . there be no doubt in my mind that this modem be the problem . I would not recommend this product and I be currently look for a new modem .
CableModem	NEG	1	the modem be sell as `` new '' but when attempt to connect the modem to my cable account the modem be still tie to another person 's account . I waste three hour try to install a item thatius have no choice but to return and deal with the hassel of return and wait for a replacement .
CableModem	POS	5	this product be unbelievably excellent , in fact , I would like to call it miraculous ! I be previously use a ordinary 4 port digital splitter -lrb- 5-2300mhz -rrb- where my cable modem , wireless router , and 2 t.v. 's be connect . this be ok for about 3 month when suddenly , I get no signal from my cable modem and wireless router , and some channel be miss in both T.V. 's . after some troubleshooting , I find out that the splitter be not work anymore . so I test a spare digital splitter of the same spec , with the same result . frustrated , I purchase another splitter with a narrower range , from 5-1000mhz from best buy . my heart sink when it also produce the same result . I call my service provider to try to get a recommendation as to what type of splitter to use , but they refuse , and attempt to pressure I to let a technician come to we house and do the connection . this , of course , for a stupid extra cost : one for the installation of a new line , and another for a extra monthly charge . I bluntly tell the customer service agent that I will not allow that and should not spend a single cent to troubleshoot the problem . they attempt to pressure I to send a technician to we house miserably fail . finally after research in the internet about similar issue , I come up with many cutomer recommend the use of this product for cable modem and t.v.s. I order this Motorola BDA throuh AMAZON , ask for a 1 day delivery , get it as guranteed by AMAZON , then install it . only after a few seconds , my cable modem , router , and T.V.s respond very well and my problem be solve . my browser become wicked fast , and the quality of picture in both t.v.s be excellent ! there be one customer who say that cable modem should not be amplify - I tell this customer he be dead wrong ! in my case , cable modem do not get any signal , until I install this amplifier . I would highly recommed this product to all customer with similar situation !
CableModem	POS	4	no problem for 2 month now . cheaply build , but work well . it arrive on time and work with Comcast internet provider .
CableModem	POS	5	good product and reliable for the price pay . . work great ... I be a first time user
CableModem	POS	5	my Motorola modem would lose connection intermittently , sometimes for extended period of time . have comcast visit and address problem with line into house and within my house . still have problem with Motorola Surfboard modem . Have have zero issue with this modem .
CableModem	POS	5	I recently move into a new home and sign up for Comcast but really do not want to lease a modem so I decide to buy my own . I check eBay but it end up be cheaper she on Amazon . Gotta love Prime . Comcast come and set everything up and it have not skip a beat since I plug it in . I would definitely recommend this modem ...
CableModem	POS	5	I want to cut down my monthly Comcast bill and one part of the bill be a monthly rental fee for the cable modem . Amazon have several DOCSIS 3.0 modem available , but I could not see any substantive difference in they , so I go with the one just like what Comcast provide to cut down on potential issue . this one work fine out of the box ; I just have to call Comcast and give they the MAC address print on the bottom of the modem -lrb- I actually have to give Comcast the MAC address again when I return the rent modem , but that be a Comcast fail -rrb- . the ubee work just like what I have before , with no monthly rental charge , so I be happy .
CableModem	POS	5	I be just hope to get fewer disconnect than with my comcast supply cable modem . I be very impressed when it be finally activate -lrb- chat + call to Comcast -rrb- and I get a `` bond '' downstream connection . it also have a gigabit connection to you pc or lan which be nice but still over kill unless you can max this thing out at 160mbp . I do not max mine out but I do double my download speed and reduce my ping by 1m . I visit speedtest dot net before and after I change to this sb6121 modem . result : original Comcast Supplied Ambit U10C018 Cable Modem -lrb- Docsis 2.0 -rrb- Avg Ping - 7m Avg Download 10.42 Mbps Avg Upload 3.62 Mbps NEW Motorola SB6121 Cable Modem -lrb- Docsis 3.0 -rrb- Avg Ping - 6m -lrb- -1 m -rrb- Avg Download 20.62 mbp -lrb- +10.20 mbp -rrb- Avg Upload 3.62 mbp -lrb- +0.10 mbp -rrb- plus I can return the `` rent '' Ambit modem and hopefully shave off a few buck from my monthly bill .
CableModem	POS	4	this device work right out of the box . . grant I have to work with the cable service provider ; have to provide MAC address . have be work w \/ out failure since put on-line over a month ago . I would highly recommend this product for any cable internet customer . I have it in a open-air arrangement and have no trouble with overheating .
CableModem	POS	5	get a use Motorola dsl modem sb5100 but do not come with the power supply . get this replacement and it work perfectly , no problem what so ever , and it come with a unbitable that price .
CableModem	POS	5	I have be use it for 3 month and it work better than the modem comcast give I . speed be good thanks to the docsis 3 and it never need rebooting . thanks Amazon !
CableModem	POS	5	replace a Comcast Scientific Atlantic modem -lrb- lease for $ 7 per month ... -rrb- with this DOCSIS 3.0 modem which be the highest recommend and certify on the Comcast site -lrb- https:\/\/customer.comcast.com\/help-and-support\/internet\/list-of-approved-cable-modems\/ -rrb- . my speed be now 20mbps d\/l and 4mbp u\/l -lrb- base on speakeasy\/speedtest which I understand may not be the most reliable -rrb- . I be happy with that since I only subscribe to the `` Performance Starter '' level of internet service from comcast\/xfinity -lrb- $ 45.95 \/ mo in ag , Georgia . -rrb- . so at the former $ 7 per month lease , this cable modem will pay for itself within a year . it have be quite reliable and my only reservation be the amount of heat it generate relative to the previous , smaller-size cable modem .
CableModem	POS	5	I read all the posting on the Motorola sb6121 and decide to give it a shot . I be pleasantly surprise . I call my Comcast technical help and they get my MAC address instead of the S\/N id as state in some other post . within a minute I be online . unless there be something out there that be go to jump at I later , I believe this be a great product and worth the money . it work very well with my Medialink Wireless-N Router .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this modem to use with comcast . you can not activate the MODEM THROUGH the ACTIVATION SCREEN that pop up , you must call COMCAST YOURSELF . save time and just call they , take about five minute to get it activate . no problem so far , the modem do not get hot just a little warm , and there be a speed small increase in internet speed . this be a good modem ; it 'll pay for itself in 12 month . would recommend .
CableModem	POS	5	only have this modem for a week , but it have be rock steady so far . only problem I have with installation be I misread a d as a 0 in the MAC address because of they tiny size . once I catch that error , it go smoothly . I dont know why they make the digit so small ! -lrb- and yes I do have my glass on , but you need a magnifer glass ! -rrb- have read several report of this unit run hot , but I dont find that to be true . at least it run cooler than the cable company supply Aires modem . very happy so far .
CableModem	POS	5	we buy the zoom modem\/router . it take a long time to figure everything out and get it setup , but once install we be happy for about two week . then it start drop the signal and not connect . we call Zoom and they suggest take it back , so we do . we try a Motorola and then back to another zoom . finally someone tell we about change the channel setting , and now the zoom work great , very fast . info about change the channel setting : theinfopond.com\/pg-modem-router.html#channel
CableModem	POS	5	I have not update my modem in quite a while , probably two year . these new DOCSIS 3.0 modem really make a difference . I have see a significant increase in internet speed . look nice and solid too .
CableModem	NEG	1	set up a new Comcast account , I have go through two attempt with Motorola modem . the first be the sb6020 , which be DOA -- would not even power up . send it back and decide to try the sb6121 , to see if they newer model perhaps have better quality control . I think I be go to have success -- the light come on -- but no luck . the first strike against this modem come when I call Comcast to try to do a `` self-install '' to save the service charge of the technician come out . in we new place , I know the previous tenant have use Comcast , so I be sure the house be already wire correctly . Comcast be unable to do a self-install over the phone for this modem , so a technician be send out . the Comcast technician , a nine-year veteran installer , spend over a hour fight with the sb6121 , try to get it to initialize . we wire it in directly , remove all splitter , etc. . . and it still refuse to recognize . keep cycling and drop service . I spend another hour on the phone with Motorola tech support , who be unable to help . finally , as a last resort , the Comcast technican plug in a similar Docsis 3.0 modem from he truck . the connection be up and work in seconds , with a stable signal and no drop service . of course , I be now fight with Comcast over the $ 99 service charge for the technician . all tell , this modem have cost I 3-4 hour of my life and $ 99 already ... and this be my second return of a Motorola modem to Amazon in less than 10 day . and I still need a modem . with the dubious quality of the current generation of Motorola modem , they have lose I as a customer for the forseeable future . if the next model be better , I 'll revisit the issue but for now , the aggravation and expense just be not worth it .
CableModem	POS	5	this modem solve my problem . the issue be I be loose connection on my surfboard I have have for year . have my cable company check the street , and I run some neutralize test to issolate the problem to my Surfboard , get this thing , and all be well . the lesson here ? buy a Modem be cheaper than rent , duh ! , but have a modem for 4-5 year you have to remember that technology have a shelf life , and I reach mine a month ago with that surfboard .
CableModem	POS	5	Amazon : shipping be fast and free . Modem : it work great with Comcast in Chicago . I buy the ubee modem instead of the Motorola sb6121 or sb6120 because of the negative review the Motorola modem receive on Amazon . it take I 30 minute on the phone with Comcast to get the ubee modem connect . I save $ 30 with self-installation . the internet be very fast with the ubee .
CableModem	POS	4	very easy to setup out of the box but documentation a bit lack in explanation of configuration and feature . I guess it be assume you already know how to configure you modem . I do have a problem with a older hp\/compaq laptop run m Vista . it would not connect to internet use WPA or PSK , try every thing I read in variuo blog but nothing work . discover there be a update for the Atheros WiFi Adapter , download and install it - connect perfectly now . very fast 20mb download speed . very please with product .
CableModem	POS	5	order this modem for Comcast service up here in Boston and it work great . packaging be minimal but sturdy , modem itself perform well .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this because my cable signal for internet be not stable at all . during the rainning day or windy day , I get no connection . after install this , it significantly improve my connection . however , when the incoming signal be way too low , it still can not solve the problem . however , I can immediately feel the difference between with and without this booster . I even buy a second one as a Chrimstmas gift to my friend , which he also feel the improve of the signal .
CableModem	POS	5	prior to purchase this modem i do some extensive research . there be several excellent modem on the market but i choose this one because of the exceptional speed , reliability and stability it offer .
CableModem	POS	5	I have internet service thru Charter , and purchase this modem to replace the Charter rental unit . it be easy to install , and come with everything I need .
CableModem	NEG	2	I be sure the Motorola surfboard  sb6121 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem be a very capable modem consider it be a Motorola product ; however , I have to put 2 star to get people attention . the Motorola surfboard  sb6121 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem be not yet on COMCAST 's list of support modem . I think that wait 4 month since the release of this product would give COMCAST time to obtain the software require to add the sb6121 to they network . well , I be wrong . it be a shame to give this product 2 star when I never even get the chance run it through its pace . I would rather give COMCAST 2 star for be lazy . the COMCAST tech that come to setup my modem say that the COMCAST system identify my modem ; however , that be about it . he connect a different modem to show I that modem on the list will work . he say that he have a  Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem  so unfortunately , I have to return the sb6121 and I order the sb6120 . I be not slam Amazon or this product . I just want to make COMCAST customer or future COMCAST customer aware that the sb6121 will not work on the COMCAST network YET .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this modem when I move into my new apartment . I be read review that some people could not get this modem to work with Comcast as they isp but I have not have any issue so far . during my research I buy this modem for three reason : - DOCSIS 3.0 - simplicity - affordable like the other reviewer I use a Medialink Wireless N Router - 802.11 n and they make a lovely pair .
CableModem	POS	5	the seller package this item very carefully and ship it post haste . the product be excellent and do what it be advertise to do . the price be excellent and I recommend they highly . I have a long run of coax from the cable provider to the last tv set on the line and this device fix the problem of all tv in the house not receive the identical channel . it be easy to overlook the lose of signal in the wire . this device compensate very well . I highly recommend it .
CableModem	POS	5	this be the 2-port version of the  Motorola Signal Booster  so who need one of these thing ? anyone who be have difficulty receive a consistent cable tv or cable modem signal be a candidate for this amp , but first check with you cable company to confirm that they have do all they can , in term of get high quality cable and splitter into you home . if they have do that , and you still notice frequent outage of you cable internet service , or pixelated -lrb- distorted -rrb- image on live or recorded tv show from cable , then you may very well need a drop amp like this one . the amplifier be particularly helpful if you be splitting a cable signal come into you house to multiple room for multiple tv feed -lrb- and this be perfectly legal to do , per the Cable Act of 1992 -rrb- . any time you split a cable signal , you lose approximately 3 db -lrb- decibel -rrb- of signal strength . split a signal enough time and it can cause you to lose you cable modem feed or get sporadic distortion on you digital cable channel . insert a cable amplifier like this into you cable feed right where it enter the home and it will boost the signal enough to survive multiple split and , in most case , will allow you to enjoy a glitch free cable tv signal throughout you home . why be this amp 's `` two-way '' or `` bi-directional '' feature important ? a two-way feed be necessary in order to support a cable modem -lrb- upload\/download -rrb- and to support interactive cable service such as ppv -lrb- pay per view -rrb- . this amp will not work miracle . again , always check you incoming signal , cable and connector quality first . but if you have do all that and be still have trouble , this little cable signal amp can be a real life-saver . it also work fine for OTA -lrb- over the air -rrb- hdtv signal distribution , but only if you be start with a decent quality signal to begin with . a full review of the Motorola Signal Booster be available on big Picture Big Sound 's web site .
CableModem	POS	5	upgrade a old motorolum Docsis 2.0 modem to this one after a note from comcast say i wasnt get full speed . seem faster and stay connected better .
CableModem	POS	5	Booster be easy to install and work as expect . allow I to add two more tv without interfere with my phone and internet over cable .
CableModem	POS	5	have read through all the previous review , be a bit concerned I would have to be on the phone with Comcast all night get this set up . not true . plug it in , attach Apple wireless router , call Comcast and give technician MAC ID , he say give it 10 to 15 minute , hang up phone - internet be work ! and at blaze speed , mind you . we have not think much about upgrade since we be not have any problem , per se -lrb- we stream music , play online game , surf , watch and record cable , etc - sometimes all at once -rrb- , but a friend at work have mention that he receive a letter from Comcast state he modem be out of date and suggest he upgrade to DOCSYS 3.0 . so we take the plunge too , since we could not recall how old we modem be . previously , streaming music would sometime have to re-buffer , Netflix streaming would cut out , would get disconnect from online game ... . we blame the provider at the time but no more ! not one problem with connectivity since we install this ! one bit of advice for Comcast subscriber - try to get to a Tech support person . I punch in that I have trouble with my internet , that get I to a technician ... since there do not seem to be a straight `` press 3 for tech support '' option . all he need be the MAC ID , which be on the device itself or the box it come in .
CableModem	POS	5	receive modem before due date , and the price be right ! it be easy to install and setup with Comcast within minute . I have have it for 3 week and have see zero hiccup so far .
CableModem	POS	4	I purchase this to avoid pay $ 7\/month rental to Verizon - at $ 80 , this will pay for itself in 1 year . the installation be easy , but I have to contact Verizon and provide they with information about this modem so that they could configure my account . the direction actually state that the cable supplier may need information about the modem so I give they credit because direction for computer equipment be usually pretty poor . I have have this about 1 month and the it have work well ; as stable as the modem I be rent from Verizon .
CableModem	POS	5	my current cable company offer the option to buy a ` approve ' modem or rent one from they and pay a monthly fee . I have have to deal with the cable company 's rental modem before : after have my surfboard for a month I can attest that the upfront cost be absolutely worth it ! I have have this for a month and I have not have to call my cable company and sit on hold for hour wait for a reset on the line yet : my first month on a rental be a nightmare , I assure you . with a good router , this be a fast and reliable modem . it also happen to be a rather attractive and simple design - it be not over do and it be certainly not as unattractive as a lot of other modem : -rrb-
CableModem	POS	5	very easy to install . i run 3 tv on it and it improve picture by 33 % . i have cable at my camper and get 80 channel analog . this help alot . thank you motorolum .
CableModem	POS	5	the sb6121 be a great update to the Surfboard sb4200 that I use previously especially since my cable provider warn I that I be about to lose my service due to obsolescence . the sb6121 be smaller much better ventilate and look better in the black case . the price be good and the sb6121 be east to install . unfortunately the unit have a external transformer that add one more to the mass of transformer power my other component . the indicator light be on all the time green and blue . the flash orange connection indicator light be a little strange but I have get accustomed to it . I would recommend this cable modem to someone .
CableModem	NEG	1	buy this modem because of how well supposedly it work with Comcast and think I could avoid the $ 7.00 rental fee every month . so after follow the ` easy ' instruction , I have no internet access , my network can not be find and there be absolutely no support . Comcast could not & would not help I because it be not there equipment . so basically I have a $ 85 paperweight . oh and it only take 2 hour to restore the network , reset the router at 1am . I work from home after hour so must be connect .
CableModem	POS	5	own you own modem be the smart way to go . Comcast be charge we $ 5 a month to rent one , it take just 8 month to save money with this modem . -lrb- this modem be on sale when I buy it -rrb- this be the most reliable cable modem I have ever use . I have have it for about two year now and it be still go strong . I can not think of the last time I have a network problem that be the fault of the modem . I do not even reset the modem anymore when have problem , since it be always the router . Pretty amazing for a refurbish modem . it be a shame Linksys brand router be not this dependable . if they be I would be a very happy camper . one downside : this modem use the aging docsis 2 standard , which do not support ipv6 . when isp start to roll out ipv6 you will not be able to take advantage of it with the cm100 . it do not matter at all for normal people because ipv6 support will not be \* require \* for many , many year , but if you be a techie like I and you want ipv6 asap , you be better off get a modem that support it .
CableModem	POS	4	I pick this up from another retailer when the Motorola sb6121 give I problem the thing keep reset . a real pain when play on line game this one be fast and reliable . no problem whatsoever . a small footprint on my desk since I do not need a separate router as well . only hiccup be a standard setting that block against flood of datum attack with the high speed Comcast I get 30m download so it think someone be flood my computer with datum . a email to zoom and they give I the quick answer on what security set to uncheck
CableModem	POS	5	we use cox for high speed internet and this modem give we great speed and reliability . since I install this modem we have not experience any issue with access the internet .
CableModem	POS	5	we have be use cable splitter before and most of we tv have very poor reception and grainy picture & some do not get any reception at all ! now , all we tv have excellent reception and better picture . it really boost !!!
CableModem	NEG	1	my modem have many issue , it will randomly reboot throughout the day . when the modem decide to work it be great , but a lot of disconnect issue on the modem end . want to add Amazon let I return this item , buy a new one with Free 1 Day shipping . Modem be run as advertise now . thank you Amazon !!
CableModem	POS	5	I have charter cable and I go from average 20m to 30m . you have to actually call Charter Cable to complete the set up . set up take about 30 minute total .
CableModem	POS	4	pro : at the time of write this review , I have have this modem plug in and run for a month straight without any problem . I get the correct speed from my modem -lrb- 20 mpb -rrb- and I have not experience any latency problem -lrb- pc and xbox 360 gaming be always fluid -rrb- . con : the modem do not have any management capability . access the modem management page -lrb- 192.168.100.1 on most home network -rrb- only give you status page and no capability to spoof MAC address or provide isp with a username and password . Make sure you isp support this modem before you buy it . conclusion : for the money -lrb- less than $ 80 -rrb- this be a great modem that may not have frill but have reliability which be far more important . I would recommend this modem -lrb- as long as you isp support it -rrb- .
CableModem	NEG	2	buy it for my mom last fall because my brother -lrb- the electronics geek -rrb- say dont get two separate unit ... so I take back the two separate unit that work well , and get this nightmare . as soon as we hook it up it begin reject any and all other device . spend over three week off and on -lrb- approx 25 hr -rrb- with tech support , finally accept internet through cable tv . it be still reject the brand new printer\/fax machine that be also suppose to be compatible . I wish I just leave well enough alone . the space she save be not worth the hassle , and it cost I $ 10 more than the other unit .
CableModem	POS	5	I have try cable tv amplifier in the past but they seem to actually make the picture worse . there be so many cable split in my house for my various tv and device -lrb- TiVo , Media Center PC , etc -rrb- that the analog channel picture quality on many be fuzzy or have distortion and I could not get many unencrypted digital qam channel at all . this both improve to analog channel to as perfect as analog get , and allow I to get the qam channel that disappear after the split !
CableModem	POS	5	I purchase this to replace the stock Ambit modem from Charter Cable . in summary , the modem install flawlessly and I do see a improvment in speed -lrb- accord to dslreports_dot_com I be run twice as fast at time -rrb- . the setup with Charter be very easy , with no phone call need . everything be do online . after insure the modem be work correctly I then install the wireless router -lrb- Belkin n + wirelss router -rrb- . it too , install flawlessly and install easier than with the stock modem -lrb- I often have to start - restart the modem and router before they would communicate . I would recommend this product . it do what it be suppose to , and installation be a breeze .
CableModem	POS	5	I do host through a home server and this modem handle the minor level of traffic well -lrb- if any of the server start take load , I offload they to ec2 -rrb- . run fine , not too hot , and be very simple to setup .
CableModem	POS	5	I get this to use with Comcast cable internet since it be on there approve list -lrb- leave 6 year of crappy att dsl 6.0 Extreme which just seem to get worse and worse as we use it and add on more device -rrb- . Works great and be easy to install . sine it be pair with a Netgear 3700v2 router it be in `` bridge '' mode which Comcast have to do for you , so you can not see any specifics about the modem once it be behind the router , which be expect . I have look at they and it seem to be work very fast with Comcast . we get a clean signal 6-10 m ping , no packet loss and 25mbp down and 4mbp up , which be great since we have 5 computer , 3 PS3 's , 5 pda -lrb- iphone , android -rrb- phone ,5 hd\/dvr Directv reciever with whole home dvr hook up to internet and a att Microcell Tower which which work like VOIP for better cell phone coverage . so you can see we be task this thing and it just keep on go . my 3 kid do a lot of online multiplayer gaming mw3 , battlefield 3 , etc. so we use alot of datum for gaming and Netflix , Vudu video download \/ streaming , last month be 465gb datum use . anyway it work well and have get good review feedback by other .
CableModem	POS	5	Charter just bump we up to 30Mb and this require I get a DOCSIS 3.0 modem and it have be wonderful !!
CableModem	POS	5	make the jump to light speed with this modem and what a difference . have a problem get up and run and I think that be because the Comcast software only give you the choice of they modem to install with . have to call they twice . second time it be a snap to get go . use Netflix with my AT&T; dsl take forever to load . clarity be not great either . with my Cable dsl through this modem it movie start almost immediately and the clarity be HD quality . best yet , I be not spend $ 5 per month to lease they cable modem ! if I have to do all over again I would get up and run use the Cable company modem then switch the next day .
CableModem	POS	5	I also decide to upgrade from dsl , as 1 mbp be the fastest we could get in we neighborhood . I do my due diligence and decide upon the Zoom 5350 , as it be on Comcast 's approve device list and have the requirement to meet we need . installation be very simple . I do not have a self-install kit from Comcast , so I just follow the direction for connect without a kit . I connect the coax cable to the modem , a supply Ethernet cable from the modem to my computer and everything else go very smoothly . I do not have to call Comcast with the MAC address , as everything be recognize during the install . all , in all installation take approx . 10 minute , very simple for anyone to accomplish . both my wireless laptop with b\/g wireless card -lrb- one on a second floor -rrb- find the network and connect without a problem after I enter the wap2 key . I may purchase Wireless-N card later , but I really do not see the need . speedtest show a average of 17 mpb for a wireless connection and 25 mbp for wire . I use the Ethernet port to wire my Blu-Ray player , Wii -lrb- I purchase a wii-lan converter -rrb- and a spare cable if I need to connect a laptop to stream Hulu or Comcast TV online to view through my hdtv . Netflix stream in hd when available -lrb- on Blu-Ray , Wii be only sd -rrb- and look and sound great . we get rid of we cable tv , and purchase the leaf attenna -lrb- see we review -rrb- from Mohu . so all we viewing on local channel -lrb- it find 35 of they -rrb- be free and in hd . if nothing be on that we want to view , we use Netflix , Hulu , or Comcast TV online . we be enjoy the savings , and now with the zoom faster speed , great picture quality as well .
CableModem	POS	5	I buy this cable modem from Amazon several week ago to replace a old one supply by the cable company . it be very easy to install and work great without any problem . the advantage be that I no longer have to rent the modem from the cable company and Amazon have the best all around price .
CableModem	POS	5	I be rent the Motorola Surfboard 5120 -lrb- sb5120 -rrb- from Comcast for $ 5\/month . this seem reasonable to I up until I find this modem for $ 30 include shipping . I will make my money back on the purchase in 6 month . excellent deal ! as other have mention all you have to do be call Comcast to activate this modem by give they the MAC address . it be both on the box , and on the unit itself . this process take I a grand total of about 15 minute once I open the box . this modem have plenty of speed out of the box . in response to other 's get up to 30 mb\/s , this be not go to be a cap on the modem 's ability . this instead be a cap limit by you service provider . this be a DOCSIS 2.0 Modem , which mean it can handle up to 42.88 mb\/s raw throughput -lrb- include overhead -rrb- or more simply 38 mb\/s -lrb- usable datum -rrb- . for I , I pay for 12 mb\/s on Comcast , and have see this modem get upward of 14 mb\/s , although this say nothing as to what the modem itself can handle . it be just Comcast not limit I strictly enough to what I have pay for .
CableModem	POS	4	my old Modem have past , it be a rather slow death that be more painful for I than it be for it - this I be sure . so I be on the hunt for a younger better model -lrb- survival of the fittest you know -rrb- - I find one in this product . it work tirelessly and do all that I ask with out question . I highly recommend this type for anyone that feel they be not get what we all should have - great service . delivery be fast and efficient - it have arrive before I though it would actually . hope this help you in you decision
CableModem	POS	4	I just recently buy this modem to update my 5 year old zoom that seem to be have issue turn out it be router that need replace , so I have a Asus 56 on the way . however , I be keep this because it be blaze fast , I notice a huge jump in internet speed almost instantly . I be go to give this four star because it say the light be suppose to be Easy to understand and I be a tech guy and I still do not understand they ... and there be not even a mention of they in the manual ... good job ubee . anyways if a Ubee guy come and comment on my post tell I how to interpret the light you 'll get a 20 % boost and reclaim you 5 star rating .
CableModem	POS	5	I be use this modem with Comcast service . the setup be very easy , although in typical isp fashion the guy on the phone have no idea be be go on . I be able to set up the router with just a phone call , although they make I purchase they ` self-installation kit ' for $ 10 -lrb- I never recieve the kit in the mail -rrb- . but enough rant about Comcast , the modem itself seem to be work very well . I have not experience any drop in service and my speed appear very consistent . I have not do any investigation into my actual speed yet , but everything feel as quick as I would expect from a Docsis 3.0 modem . all in all , I be very satisfied with my purchase , provide it last a few year .
CableModem	POS	5	work great out of box ; easy setup . no dropout in several week -lrb- unlike the Dlink modem it replace -rrb- . it do what it be suppose to do -lrb- act invisible -rrb- ; recommend highly .
CableModem	POS	5	Works seamlessly with my Comcast account . no issue at all after setup . I would recommend this docsy 3.0 version for sure .
CableModem	POS	5	this be a great modem . nothing to do but hook it up , call you cable company to give they the hardware address and wait for they to imput the info . it connect in less than 5 minute .
CableModem	POS	5	receive my ZOOM 5350 3.0 Modem-Router combo today . could not wait to install it . call cox . internet and within minute the ZOOM 5350 be up and run . wait at least ten minute for a tech person come on line to give he the MAC address , etc. . this dude know how to connect with speed to the internet . my old Motorola Surfboard SB5100 modem as become of old age and need replace . my surfboard sb5100 download speed be 22.24 mbp , and upload speed be 3.54 mbp . this zoom 5350 as lighting download speed of 28.56 mbp and upload speed of 8.14 mbp . that be good enough for I and not complain . I 'll report back in couple month for another report .
CableModem	POS	5	Modem be very easy to hook up . love the slim design and the fact that you can either lay it flat or stand it up .
CableModem	POS	4	I purchase this modulator-demodulator -lrb- modem -rrb- for use with my Comcast Broadband Internet Service . it be work well with no complaint , no complaint at all !
CableModem	POS	4	Great , work good pretty easy to hook up and have have no issue . I have be use it for more than a month .
CableModem	POS	5	work like a charm right out of the box ! no fuss , no muss . I have purchase this to extend signal about 100 ' and because of the multiple output port , I hook up short coax cable to the closest tv and dvd recorder as well . Picture quality also improve a lot !
CableModem	POS	5	I have be use this splitter\/amplifier for over a year now . I have two 50 + foot cable run located in different room of we house - one to my hdtv cable box , the other to a cable modem . I can surf through the cable OnDemand catalog , stream show and do network intensive activity -lrb- downloads\/uploads , voip -rrb- simultaneously without a problem . bi-directional performance and the overall connection have be be rock solid . in the past , I have use both electroline and pct splitter\/amplifiers . we have fairly unstable power where I live , with frequent short outage and spike . for both the electroline and pct product , even though they be always plug into surge suppressor -lrb- both the electrical and cable line -rrb- , they eventually blow out . the Motorola have weather a year 's worth of storm and random outages\/spikes and be still run great . do not know if this be just luck or a sign of the high build quality of the device . the connector be solid -lrb- nothing even come close to wiggle -rrb- and the overall build quality appear to be quite high . I have not have to touch it since I install it , so I be a happy camper .
CableModem	NEG	1	have I find this comcast forum post at -lrb- ... -rrb- , I would not have buy dpc3008 . Cisco DPC3000 work fine earlier . now , I have no support for resolve drop connection issue with this dpc3008 . Comcast keep reset and tell no log of any disconnection activity . Cisco on the other hand be not tell what be with the firmware that people be talk on the Comcast forum . both company need to figure out the fix to this problem soon . update -lrb- April 18 2012 -rrb- : Comcast revert back the firmware build date to Aug 11 2011 and it fix the drop connection issue . definitely , this would change my opinion on the product to excellent .
CableModem	NEU	3	to all you naysayer , let start here : this be purchase for use on Comcast . yes , Comcast currently have this very modem on they `` approve '' list ; yes , I do my homework ; yes , I be smarter than a rock ; and yes , Motorola should have do more to insure they product work reliably on such a major provider system . this modem refuse to provision on the network , simple as that . Comcast could see the modem , ping it and send the provision information ... the MODEM refuse it . so do the second modem . I be a big fan of Motorola product but this be disappointing . also , the HFC MAC seem to be all wrong . most mac start 00 and these be start with 74 . I do not know if that contribute to the problem or not though .
CableModem	NEG	1	I buy a refurbish Linksys router and it have work well now for over a year so I feel that buy a refurbish Linksys modem be a fairly safe bet . how wrong I be . as instruct I call comcast to give they the Mac address of the router however could not get the modem to show up with comcast . we try for hour with several different technician and supervisor but to no avail . add to this there be a no return policy for this unit . do not waste you money .
CableModem	POS	5	I receive this item and have make arrangement to cable service start . what I think be interesting be the tech from Comcast say this device be completely unusable since the serial number have be register elsewhere I have to rent a unit from he . after a couple of day , I call the service department and while on the phone he tell I all I need be the MAC address and they would take care of the rest . well , needless to say , the unit work great ! be even able to connect my router to and set up my network with no issue . what be Comcast think ? well , when I get my bill they overcharge I for the service I sign up for and keep the rent charge on the bill after I return they modem . the modem work great and I be glad I make the purchase !
CableModem	POS	5	Have have the same modem for about 10 year and it finally start give I problem . talk to comcast and they say I should change it out and the loss connectivity issue would go away . as well as I get all the speed I be pay for on the internet . for once they where right . connection be simple and no issue along with my dowload speed doubling . my netflix stream alot better on my tv and with the 3 laptop go at the same time everything be run smoothly . I be be cheap not want to upgrade but it be well worth it . the fam be verry happy I break down and do it . Hope this help anyone out there think about the upgrade .
CableModem	POS	5	the modem be smaller than other which be a benefit to I . the modem work with Time warner cable and it set up quickly - can not say the same for time warner . this be important information about set up the modem with you cable company : I have 7 hour worth of call try to set up this modem because hold time be about 30 minute between reps. they will tell you that this be `` not '' a approve device even though it be approve on time warner website and level one tech support . Hang up on the rep who will not set up you modem and call you local office - finally , I do get through to someone who do not even ask for model number and all they want be the MAC and serial number - here be the problem , my device address end with a `` b '' and the rep apparently could not assign a b to the system and take it upon herself to enter a `` 8 '' and never tell I about she change . so , a phone call to tech support and then back to customer service to change a 8 to a b - then back to tech support - it be work perfectly . tip : be certain to tell they you be use a DOCSIS 3.0 modem , that way the `` b '' will be accept . and then ask they to repeat the MAC address and DOCSIS version prior to end the call . you will save about 5-6 hour in phone call . additionally ; I do have digital voice and Tech support on `` that day '' say that none of the telephony modem work with Time Warner . they have ask I to pick up a free splitter and two short coaxial cable from the local time warner office so that I can connect both device . once both device be connect , time warner say they would not charge a monthly fee for a deactivate modem be use for phone call only .
CableModem	POS	5	the modem be deliver exactly as promise , it arrive early , and it work great . my internet speed have more than double since switching from the modem I be rent from Charter .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I have it plug into a work laptop . a couple of thing : First , you get message when you try to install the driver about how they be not Windows certify or approve software . second , when the computer go into sleep mode and you wake it back up it flicker a big before you can type . the only other thing be that the first time I go on a business trip and come back and plug everything back in , I have to re-install the driver and reboot the pc . I be hope that do not continue . if it do , I 'll update the review .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	if you be still stick on a agp system this be the best card you can get , be very good for a less than $ 100 . y usualy use to think that any card around $ 100 be bad and cheap , but this prove I wrong . I can even play Assassin 's creed with full graphic on 1280x1024 and dx10 with my old agp , p4 3.4 ht and 3gb ram computer . pro : great value , good performance , can be oce . con : maybe its too big to for any computer , but I manage to get into my case . final thought : if you need a agp card dont look for more , buy this one .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	First off , this be not `` the best '' card out there , however this single card can still run many of today 's modern game on high\/ultra\/max . a few exception would be game like battlefield 3 , Crysis , Starcraft II , cutting-edge game that be push the limit of today 's technology .

GraphicsCard	POS	4	I use nVidia card for render scene from 3d content creation software -lrb- in this case blender with its cycle GPU renderer -rrb- , so this review will almost certainly not be relevant to most of the people look at this item . I get this as a upgrade over my current EVGA gtx 550 ti -lrb- which I also use for 3d rendering but do not have enough RAM for large scene -rrb- . I do realize that these card be make with gaming in mind but give such good performance -lrb- thanks to those CUDA core -rrb- that they be a much better deal than either the Quadro or Tesla gpus . the only real downside be the heat that these generate . my old 550 would hover at a steady 80c while under load -lrb- which be for a very long time in this sort of application since the GPU will work at 99-100 % for the duration of the render - which can take between a few minute to month if you be render a longer animation -rrb- . this gtx 570 have the advantage of have 2.5 gb RAM onboard but also generate a lot more heat thanks to its higher clock speed and significantly higher core count . during render it would idle at 89-90c , which be way up there . some mess around with the include precision tuning software to up the fan speed help cool thing down a little but eventually I have to underclock the card by around 200mhz to get it down to around 80c . performance-wise it cut render time down to a quarter ! totally worth it when that mean ~ 5 hour versus ~ 20 for a image . I be invest in a couple more fan to move air in , out , and around my system . liquid cooling would probably do this wonder but I do not trust it in case of a leak in my main production machine . I would love to tell you how it run game but the most graphically demand one that I own for the pc be Bioshock -lrb- which be far from new -rrb- , which this run buttery smooth on max setting . so take that for whatever it be worth . it be worth note that I live in Hawaii and therefore have a pretty high ambient temperature : -lrb- I will upload some example screenshot of it in action . Update - 2 week later : after add three additional fan to my system I have only manage to get the GPU temperature to drop by 4c . the idea of have it burn out soon or melt down \/ catch fire -lrb- unlikely though that may be -rrb- lead I to give in and invest in liquid cooling . I get a Koolance ext-440 external all in one -lrb- pump , liquid reservoir , radiator -rrb- with a Koolance gpu-210 universal GPU cool block and some Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste . it be not cheap , but it actually run at a good temperature now -lrb- and altogether still cost less than a good Quadro card ! -rrb- . under very heavy load it stick to 60c with the standard clock setting . if I underclock I can get it to run at a steady 40c under full load . much happier now , just cross finger that I do not end up with a spill : -rrb-
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I be unable to use this product for my pc be not design to install this type of video card . sorry not use not rate .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	my pc be a very old one and do not have a pcie slot . this card fit well . installation be a snap and work very well with Windows 7 . I be able to increase my system performance from 2.0 to 3.5 with this card . however , the card 's heatsink be too tall and will collide with a adjacent PCI card . so , either it take up 2 slot or try to install in the far end slot .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I install this onto the mother board easy peasy , and boot up . go to nvidia website and it automatically update and install . this improve my computer performance , and I now have 2 monitor as a extended workspace ... it be really great !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Easy to install out of box . it generate 7.8 out of 7.9 . it allow you play most high-end game with maximum setting . but need to download newest driver from AMD website . I have research a lot on AMD 6870 and AMD 7770 . but I finally purchase 6870 due to the higher performance . recommend this card to the gamer with limited budget .

I also recommend this 4gb version versus any 2gb version . battlefield 3 at 6000x1080 and Ultra setting use 1.8 gb of vram . IMHO , it be worth the extra $ 50 for the 4gb . I forsee future game pass the 2gb mark -lrb- which would bottleneck on the 2gb card -rrb- such as Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3 . especially with high-re texture pack ! for those who be not aware , vram do not scale with slus either -lrb- so do not look for sli-ing two 2gb card to solve this -rrb- . although I have three 1.28 gb 470 's , they do not combine to create `` 3.84 gb '' of vRAM . each graphic card get `` load '' with the same file . then they split the render process between they . SO , I still only have 1.28 gb of vram total . pro : out perform my three gtx470 's at 1\/3rd the wattage ! run Cool and Quiet -lrb- especially compare to my 470 's -rrb- have 4gb option -lrb- which I highly recommend for high-re gamer -rrb- con : price ? -lrb- but seriously , do not buy what you can not afford -- and I doubt this matter since you know these card exist so you know what you be get into LOL -rrb- a + by my standard !

GraphicsCard	POS	5	when it come down to buy a new top-of-the-line graphic card , you pretty much have two option : atus 4870x2 or Nvidia GTX 295 . the Nvidia GTX 295 be the surefire winner between these two , as benchmark after benchmark it outperform the ATI . also worth mention , the ATI have severe driver issue , and run extremely hot . the gtx 295 provide amazing graphic -lrb- better than two gtx 280 's or even 2 gtx 285 's , -rrb- run cool -lrb- about 55 c under full load with stock cooling no overclocking , -rrb- evga be one of the best manufacturer -lrb- they offer mod-friendly warranty and a 30-day upgrade grace period , -rrb- and with the latest driver run no problem . if you be go to spend hundred of dollar for top-notch computer part , you be go to want they to work without wait for month for decent driver and the gtx 295 deliver . just be aware , if you be use two of these in Quad-SLI , be aware that you will not be able to run dual monitor with xp .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this card to replace a pv-t44a-yapv-t44a-yang -lrb- basically the same card -rrb- that I think be get twitchy on my p225 CRT monitor -lrb- be shut down computer on start up , reduce color on monitor , and monitor control not work -rrb- I replace the Power supply -lrb- you usual first suspect -rrb- and the problem continue . I swap out monitor and the flat work , but my beloved CRT still have problem , so I remove the YANG card and put this one in and problem go away ; I be still not happy , as I be very anal . remove the new card and put the old one back in -lrb- it be less than two year old -rrb- and the problem be go . reset the graphic card before you do ANYTHING ELSE . Nuff say
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this be a very high quality piece , craftsmanship show . sure , there be faster card out there , but this card be run sc2 at ultra setting in 1980x1080 without break a sweat . I average 45 + fp . before overclock . for $ 160 , that be hard to top . also , the Trixx software from Sapphire be extremely easy to use . I be now run a 11 % GPU overclock and 20 % memory overclock while maintain -lrb- 60c temp run fan at 35 % . Stock fan\/heatsink . not one crash . great buy .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	buy this as part of my budget gaming pc ; I mainly play sc2 which it can run on ultra setting -lrb- I usually just play on medium\/high -rrb- GPU temp go to ~ 55c if I be run sc2 for a few hour on medium\/high ; should also be note that I have a Antec three Hundred case w \/ very nice cooling overall very good graphic card and very quiet
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have be wait to purchase the gtx 680 , but it have not come back in stock at msrp price . even if it be in stock , I be feel that drop $ 500 on a card would be something I could not quite justify . then I read the Toms Hardware review of the gtx 670 and be amaze at they result -lrb- this card perform within a few frame per second of the gtx 680 , a card $ 100 more expensive -rrb- . judge by how quickly the gtx 680 's go out of stock , I seek out and purchase this card from Amazon at $ 399 in less than 10 min after finish say article . the card arrive today and I quickly swap it out with my beloved Saphhire AMD HD 4870 . my system boot with no problem and within a few min I have the new GeForce driver install . for reference , I have a older quad core , the Q6700 @ 2.666 GHz , 8 gb ddr2 @ 800mhz , and a 1920 x 1080 monitor . performance Skyrim : amazing . smooth . I feel the difference immediately ; no more slight stutter when turn quickly . fireball , dragon , this card do not even blink . BF3 : turn everything up to ultra\/max . I fly a chopper over oil field while tank and infantry fire crisscross the earth . jet buzz I try to get a easy kill but I dodge they like a bad father evade child support . for the first time , battle field 3 feel fluid ; it be like I be play a new game . so smooth , so crisp ; it almost distract you from the horror that be war . Adobe CS5 : after add GeForce GTX 670 to a text file , Premiere pro implement the Mercury Playback Engine for extra hardware acceleration during editing . I open a project where as before my system would playback the video at only about 14fp ; now , with this card , it play back real time . I be able to quickly jog back and forth in the timeline without any major lag . without any modification , Adobe Photoshop detect and implement hardware acceleration . I can not wait until I get CS6 and use photoshop for video effect , I imagine this feature will help immensely . sound much quieter than my hd 4870 . I imagine this be because the older GPU be work harder and thus auto-set the fan higher . as it be with the gtx 670 , I can barely hear comp when I be wear my sennheiser pc350 headphone . AWESOMENESS Yes . my advice ; if you be wait around for the gtx 680 , buy one of these instead -lrb- provide you can find stock at msrp price -rrb- . good luck solider , you 'll need it !
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	last Update : just want to add - if you select a hdtv resolution -lrb- 720p\/1080i\/1080p -rrb- in CCC , the audio will not drop out . unfortunately for I , my lcd 's native resolution be 1360x768 so I have to choose that resolution which be consider a basic resolution in CCC . for any basic resolution , the audio will cut out . one workaround would be to run a digital coax\/optical from my mobo to the receiver , but this add a extra cable lol . I be still just use my 5770 since I be have a hard time justify the price of a 6950 since you can find a 7850 for the same price . I be hold out for the hope that AMD will release a driver fix , in which case I would repurchase the 7850 . or if Amazon would put out a deal on the LG 55LM7600 , I would get that , rebuy this card , run 1080p , and call it a day . Update 2 : well my new receiver come , Denon 2312CI , and unfortunately that receiver experience the same issue with the Sapphire 7850 as my Onkyo do , confirm by testing in 2 different computer . my old Radeon 5770 still work perfectly in both computer and with both receiver . I have come to the conclusion , that this 7850 , at least the 2 particular Sapphire 7850 card I receive , do not smoothly stream audio to a receiver over hdmus without cut out every now and then . Update : I also try Catalyst 12.6 beta , a new HDMI cable , and a different input on my receiver . I try everything except hook the 7850 straight up to my lcd and use my lcd 's speaker . this be what I just do and so far , 10 song , I do not think I have hear it skip , unless it happen so fast that I be not pick up on it . on the Onkyo receiver , when it would skip , the no audio source would show up for a second while the receiver look for the audio . I do not understand why my hd5770 would work fine with the Onkyo 707 and the 7850 would not . be it a problem with the receiver or the 7850 ? I would need either another 7850 or another receiver to confirm , both of which I do not have . I 'll do more research and update soon . : End Edit I be so stoke to upgrade my Radeon hd5770 with this card for summertime gaming . my gaming\/htpc consist of a Intel i7-860 , Asus P7P55D , G. Skill 8gb ddr3 , crucial 256gb m4 , Onkyo TX-SR707 , AV123 ELT525T speaker , and Samsung 40 '' lcd -lrb- upgrade to 55 '' lead soon -rrb- . I slap this silent beast into my computer and reinstall the newest Catalyst 12.4 driver and off I be . I do some video benchmark and then watch some YouTube video since I have a couple friend over . then something weird start happen . in about every YouTube video I play , the audio would cut out for a second , and then come back in . I have my setup as follow Video Card HDMI - -rrb- Receiver HDMI in and then HDMI out - -rrb- tv . with my previous hd5770 , all other component be the same , I never have audio cut out ever . I think it might have be a problem with flash 's hardware acceleration , so I unchecked that , but the audio still cut out for a second . I then think it be a problem with flash so I play some html5 YouTube video , still the audio would cut out for a second and then resume . then I think it be maybe a problem with Firefox , so I play iTunes on repeat , and about every 5 minute or so -lrb- sometimes less , sometimes more -rrb- , the audio would drop out for a second and then come back . so then I think it be maybe a problem with Catalyst 12.4 so I try Catalyst 12.3 and Catalyst 12.5 beta , still same problem . then I try format and reinstall Windows 7 pro 64bit , still the same problem in every application . at this point , I swap my hd5770 card back in , watch a dozen YouTube video and play iTunes for a hour or so , no skip , no drop out , everything play perfectly . so then I think maybe there be some other component in my computer that just do not play nicely with the hd7850 , so I install it in my office comp -lrb- Intel c2d e6600 , Gigabyte p35-ds3l , 4gb ddr2 , Intel X25-M 80gb , this be the computer that my hd5770 will be go in -rrb- . and in this computer too , the audio from Sapphire 's 7850 would cut out for a second and then resume in every application I try . swap the hd5770 back in and no problem . at this point , I have determine that it must be a problem within the Sapphire hd7850 . the HDMI in the card I receive just can not play media without the audio randomly cut out\/skipping . this be very unfortunate since otherwise , this be a powerful and quiet card . I have not send it back yet , still google for answer -lrb- Sapphire 's Community Run support Forum be a joke -rrb- , but I will most likely end up send it back within the next 2 week . I be weary of try another hd7850 card from a different manufacturer for fear of the same thing happen , so I may get a NVIDIA GeForce 570 GTX , even though it will run hotter and probably louder ... unless I build up the courage and money to try a radeon hd7870 .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	this card perform excellently . however within the first two week of own it I have several red screen of death . I search around online and have find many other people with the same issue . I have request a replacement from Amazon that will arrive tomorrow , if the second card be problem free this rating will go up to a four . however I can not give a five to a product that have apparently zero quality control . be wary of this line from EVGA . -lrb- ... -rrb- or just google `` EVGA GTX 670 FTW red screen ''
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this sapphire hd6870 card be a great replacement for the previous Radeon hd4850 1gb card that come with this machine -lrb- HP Pavilion elite d5200t w\/8gb RAM -rrb- originally . the primary reason for buy this card be to utilize GPU processing with non-gaming app via DirectCompute and great price\/performance . secondarily , even though I be more of a casual gamer these day I also want to have dx11-capable hardware for any new game I may fancy at some point that use it . the card be trivial to install ; simply download\/install the latest driver from AMD and you be set . overall , this card be a marked improvement over the hd4850 I have ; I would especially recommend it to anyone look to upgrade a hd4800 or lesser series radeon card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	have this card be like have too many girlfriend . lot of fun but very expensive . like all the other review I read this card run every game I have at 1920 x 1080 at max setting without a stutter . it be quieter at load than the 6970 it replace and get many more fp at higher aa setting . I love the way it throttle the frequency accord to demand to save energy . the fan on mine have never go above 60 % to keep the GPU at 80 c degree or below . my older game stay in the 40 's . I run most of my game with vsync and not see the FPS drop below 60 on any at max setting . this card be a winner !
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I love this card . it have the best performance spec that I could find for a card under two hundred . it take everything I throw at it . Skyrim , battlefied3 , The Old Republic , all at highest setting and still get good fp . I would have give this card a 5 Star rating , but no crossfire ? also this card be massive , I have to push some of my hard drive forward and finagle cable in order to get it to fit . the fan be quiet until it reach 75 % -lrb- use MSI Afterburner -rrb- or higher fan speed .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	this card will display on 4 display but only by make they into two big display . the program that come with it will not work on my machine and I have to re-setup my display every time I turn on the computer . it be work with 8 display on 4 dual card but I think this might be better . it 's not !

I need the extra compute but for gaming alone a 1.1-1 .15 ghz hd7950 will even beat a gtx680 , negate much of the need to spend $ 100 + more on a hd7970 . - the Amazon card do not come with 3 free game voucher - Sapphire have just launch they vapor-x hd7970 ghz edition 3gb gddr5 card with vapor chamber and 1000mhz GPU clock -lrb- with 1050mhz GPU boost -rrb- . those should be available shortly . I buy this card a while back , but for those who do not , that be pretty much the successor to the Dual-X .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I keep watch for THIS MODEL NUMBER GRAPHICS CARD to come into stock , DUE to the initial shortage in MANUFACTURING . one NIGHT ABOUT 10 PM PST , THERE IT WAS in STOCK , ON SALE , AT A great price to boot . I receive it very quickly via UPS and HOOKED IT up and had it run in no time at all . what a great graphic card , one of the best on the market at THIS PRESENT TIME . thank you ` AMAZON.COM ' for get stock on THESE . I have total trust in all my purchase from AMAZON !!!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	so far so good - if I have any trouble with the card later I plan to update this review . use this card to replace a failed card -lrb- Gainward Ti 4400 -rrb- in my older Pentium 4 computer run Windows xp -lrb- motherboard : ASUS P4P800 -rrb- . it work use the exist nVidia driver that be already install , so I do not need to use the CD . I avoid use any driver supply on cd or dvd anyway - have always find it much better to download the latest driver from card maker website and avoid headache . note : this card use the older agp slot , not the newer pci-e slot , so be sure you computer have a agp slot before order this card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this card work well on older pc that only have pcus slot on the motherboard . it have be work well without problem on my Windows xp Media Center Edition pc . it can play older game , such as Roller Coaster tycoon 1 and 2 . unfortunately game that be graphic hog will not work with this graphic card . otherwise the card work very well
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I order this card from Amazon , specifically because it be the right card at the right price . check out pcper.com and search hd 7850 review to see how this card stack up against the competition , and you will get a more complete picture -lrb- no pun intend -rrb- . but to summarize : at $ 250 , this card destroy the Nvidia GTX 560tus -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- and run just short of the gtx 570 -lrb- $ 300-330 -rrb- unless you overclock . the figure I be use be valid at time of purchase . you can assume the lowest possible price either at Amazon or at a competitor . further info . pro : 1 . power consumption . this card only draw about 130w on one 6-pin pcie power cord , which be ridiculously low for its capability . a pcie slot already provide a bit more than 70W , so the draw on the power supply be minimal . this mean you can upgrade without spend a lot on a power supply -lrb- minimum 500w -rrb- . the 570 need either 2 pcie 6-pin or a 6 and a 6 +2 with 550w - 600w minimum power supply , depend on sub-manufacturer . 2 . temperature . the card only run about 60 c at load , which be also very low , and this mean you do not have to worry as much about case performance to maintain temperature within operate limit . this do not mean you can leave you case a mess , but it do mean that you do not have to spend serious cash to get good airflow . good cooling = longer life . 3 . capability . the hd 7850 can maintain a good to great fp -lrb- frame per second -rrb- on the highest setting on you favorite directx 11 game . this be the programming platform for 3d gaming , and at the time of review , it be the most current form of 3d platforming . as a estimation , this card should be able to run a good fp well into the future . best guess be 2 year . after that , I would not be surprise if you be not already consider a new pc or a upgrade anyway . 4 . size . this go unappreciated by a ton of upgrader and gamer , but the size of this card make it a viable upgrade , even for micro-atx mobo and case , mean you still must measure , but it be more likely than not that this card will fit into into you case . 5 . overclocking . dl the Sapphire TRIXX app for you desktop , and you can stabilize a 20 % increase in performance . exceptional and freak awesome , mean without purchase the oc version of the card , you can crank this puppy up to way beyond stock clock for f-r-e-e . best price ever . con : 1 . performance . I be a bit disappointed this card do not lay the gtx 570 to waste , but when you consider the premium you pay for the gtx 570 , I think this card be justified . I would expect the gtx 570 & 580 to go on a significant discount for a long time with high rebate from the manufacturer because of this new series of Radeon card and the gtx 600 series , which be be release as this be type , but as mention above , power consumption and ventilation with the NVIDIA 570 be subpar in comparison . 2 . warranty . I could not find the xfx version of this card at the time of purchase , which be a bummer because XFX have the best warranty -lrb- lifetime -rrb- and customer service of any radeon sub-manufacturer . Sapphire be not a pushover with 2 year , and they have be make Radeon for a long time with great success and reliability . 3 . the answer : I be wonder whether Radeon should have design accord to a higher spec and standard ; it be as though this card be design to compete with older gtx 500 series card . I would expect NVIDIA to answer the Radeon 7800 series gpus with something exceptional as they continue to release the gtx 600 series . then again , you can always get a better deal on dated merchandise if you wait to buy ... Conclusion : you will not make a bad decision between this card and the gtx 570 -lrb- evga have a good reputation , warranty , and customer service -rrb- , but at the time of release and my purchase , the Radeon 7850 be a great bang-4 - $ card , and it deserve all the praise it receive for be a serious card at a good price with greater accommodation for more case , mobo , and power supplies than the gtx 570 or 560ti . Update 4\/24\/12 : everything still work at 100 % . battlefield 2 Bad Company be smooth as dive chocolate on highest setting . battlefield 3 seem even better . have already purchase Guild war 2 , for which I be sure this card will be overkill . BTW : run AMD 955 black , 8 gb 1300 RAM , Samsung 7200 1TB HD , 600W OCZ PSU . Update 5\/13\/12 : no problem whatsoever . play in the gw2 beta over 4\/27 -4 \/ 29 , and with the exception of a massive amount of player who take part in the good-bye extravaganza , no lag at highest setting , which be excellent for beta . Witcher run very well , but Witcher 2 seem to be the new benchmark for video card . I 'll have to nab that at some point in the future . I have have 2 reader ask I about x-fire previously , which I do not really advocate because of the relative expense . you could get a top o crop card for $ 500 , and one gtx 680 or hd 7970 will lay this card to waste . I can not give you the technical expertise -lrb- technical writer , not a engineer -rrb- to show it , but I have it on good authority -lrb- pcper.com , pcbuilder.com -rrb- that one premium card be worth more than two mid-range . that be say , if you insist on x-fire , you can only bridge 2 HD 7850s together with the current hardware . I do not see this as a `` con . '' if you be serious about gaming and would like to bridge mid-range card together , go for it . but I think that be a feature best reserve for premium stock , where there be no improvement beyond add additional card . if you want better gaming , save you dime and buy the better card . Make sure to keep you eye out for GTX 6XX card . at this point , the gtx 680 -lrb- good luck find one -rrb- and 670 -lrb- $ 400 , also good luck find one -rrb- have be release , and I would expect that the 660 will be the horse run at the neck of the hd 7850 . we 'll see .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I originally be saddened very much when I learn how obsolete my old video card be . I upgrade from a ATI Radeon 9800 XT -lrb- AGP interface -rrb- . I think this card be awesome and be disappoint that it be the only thing hold I back from play newer game such as Bioshock . my older card only have pixel shader 2.0 . this be very depressing as I buy the computer use and be not look forward to the option of have to replace the whole system . however I be surprise to see that such a good card come in the agp format . this card be just awesome . it be however extremely long , longer then I have anticipate . if you computer be a small compact thing , this simply will not fit in it . it have a power cord that come with it . its really simple to plug in ; just make sure you power supply can handle the extra strain . also this card do come with DVI port -lrb- 2 -rrb- and s-video -lrb- 1 -rrb- . do not worry though : this card will work with you standard VGA monitor as they include a converter . however to fully appreciate this card , you will get better result with a lcd via DVI connection . this card so far have handle everything I have throw at it with surprising number of fp -lrb- frame per second -rrb- . I be extremely pleased with this card . I be not look forward to have to replace my whole computer just to try and get a pci-e slot . if you know you case have a great amount of space , and you look to take you game to the next level , you should really try this card out . you will be stunned !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	it work ... play my game smooth ... a video card be just another component ... it wont open a beer or jerk chicken .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	exactly what I expect out of this card . amazingness . Works wonder with my new Sabertooth 990x and AMD FX 6-Core : -rrb- . Plays multiple game simultaneously in high def .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I already have a identical card make by another manufacturer -lrb- gigabyte -rrb- . I want to try crossfire with my exist card , just for the hell of it -lrb- I can run most game in ultra setting -rrb- . however , because of how fast these card get sell out on other retailer site and how the manufacturer do not make they anymore , it be nearly impossible until I decide to search it on Amazon . I must say that its availability despite be open box be astonishing . also know how much effort Amazon put in with open box item , I order it without hesitation . I get the item in Amazon 's box , not the manufacturer but this be not a problem . I receive everything from the original box content , include cable , free dirt game , manufacturer driver disc , and the manual . if you be also look for this card for crossfire with you exist 6950\/70 card , I highly recommend it . FYI , this card also have the bio mode 1 and mode 2 switch on the card for you to flash it with 6970 driver , in order to unlock additional shader on the 6950 card . I do not do it on this card as I do try it on my other card previously , but due to heat level and how I do not have a issue with run game revert it back . although the price be pretty much the same as its retail price would go if it be available as a new item online , I do not mind it as it be nearly impossible to find these card . have fun and thanks Amazon .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	run bf3 on Ultra on a 24 '' 1920 x 1200 Dell monitor with 8 gb of ram . this be a very good GPU . also , the GPU fan keep the GPU very very cool . amazing card for the price !
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	I be in the minority here , but my first card run insanely hot , give artifact , and have serious driver issue . the second be not much better . hdmus sound go in and out , could not shake artifact in Skyrim , and it stay in the high 70s to low 80 . the coil whine be also unbearable at speed . overall , it be a massive disappointment . spent week try to work through the issue , and have little success . still , I be go to try a reference card rather than jump ship to Nvidia .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	December 26 , 2011 update -- my wife get I one for Christmas . after my previous experience below , it be exactly what I want . I just try it -lrb- have already load the driver as note below -rrb- . it be work great ! Hmm -- I have another monitor that I could probably use with this computer ... December 11 2011 update -- as indicate below , the purchase be for the church computer . it have be install there and be use successfully in the Worship Service today . it continue to be easy to install and reliable . ORIGINAL -- I install this today . and it work great immediately follow installation . -lrb- 1 -rrb- I make sure that the device be not attach to the computer as note in the guide . -lrb- 2 -rrb- I go to Startech.com and click on download and driver , then enter the device name and dowload the driver . -lrb- 3 -rrb- then I run the driver . -lrb- 4 -rrb- as note in the guide , it eventually indicate that I need to restart so I let the computer restart . -lrb- 5 -rrb- I have the monitor and and cable ready but as note , wait until after the computer restart -- and I give it a few minute so that all application be up and run . -lrb- 6 -rrb- then I plug in the usb cable to the computer -lrb- 7 -rrb- the screen come on immediately . I do go into the system setup as suggest to review and eventually change another monitor so now I have -lrb- a -rrb- laptop screen -lrb- b -rrb- monitor 2 which be connect to the VGA port on the laptop -lrb- c -rrb- monitor 3 which be connect through the USB2VGAE3 each be on and each have different item display . I want to check this out on my computer before we install it on a laptop at church which be use for morning worship presentation -lrb- well it be until we add a new screen which it could not handle -rrb- . so - it be go to be use there . and probably in a month I will be get one for myself . and then probably one for my wife . all in all , if it the new one work as well for I as this one have , I would give it more star than 5 . it be nice to have a product that work well right from the beginning . thanks Startech.com and thanks amazon.com .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	pro : very fast card for the old AGP slot ! Easy to install ! driver on include cdrom work just fine despite what other review have say ! no stability issue to speak of ! cosmetically the card look great ! high stock clock and can be overclocked quite high ! gddr3 memory be the only way to go ! con : card require a powerful power supply of 450 watt 30-amp minimum , I recommend a 500 watt 35-amp or better PSU . card require two Molex 4-pin lead from PSU to function properly . this card be very long and as such will not fit in minus tower , full tower only ! other thought : the bottom line be that they no longer make card for the AGP slot . and if you do not want to throw a bunch of money into build a new system , this be you best bang for buck card to keep that older agp system current to the time . I have a first generation single core AMD 64-bit pc which I soon plan to upgrade to dual core because the new bio on my Asus board support they . when install this card , I have to move my hard drive to a lower slot in the bay because the card be so long it extend to the front of they . I use the driver that be on the include disk , they install fine . I have have no instability issue or driver issue since . and I test this card with fear with all option max out , and all I get to say be WOW ! Time to mop the deck with some hozer online : p consider the 3850 come out not that long ago , you will be pretty current with this card and should keep you system go for a year of more till you next upgrade . I be happy with my purchase !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the StarTech usb to VGA Video adapter work as promise . Easy to hook up and I search to the StarTech.com web site to get the latest software update for enable the adapter . so far it work great and I have no complaint . I would recommend it to other .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	use it to bump up a older dual xeon machine -lrb- 2 x 2.0 ghz 32bit -rrb- . make a world of difference . use it for almost 2 month now with not a problem . I would buy it again if I need another .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	i buy the gtx 670 2670-kr model and last about 2 week . please buy this model -lrb- 2678-kr model -rrb- i do not hear any problem at newegg website review for 2678-kr model . i see the benchmark at youtube and gtx 680 and 670 be almost same performance . but gtx 570 and 580 make a huge difference .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this on the 14th and receive it on the 15th . the card be very good , and have a dual bio switch . shader be unlock easily by just flip the bio switch . the temperature be around 37-38 at idle and max be around 61 degree while play crysis and the witcher 2 on max setting . this card average around 40 fp on very high setting when use Crysis Benchmark . overall , this be a excellent card and I be very satisfied .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I be rating this low not because of the performance of the card but because the active Mini Display Port to DVI adapter be miss . this be the most expensive adapter that be suppose to be include .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	install the card in 6 minute and its work great . Sapphire include everything I need . I be short one power adapter but they supply two , so it work out fine . just run Windows the card be silent . you can not even hear the two fan . I fire up just cause 2 for about 2 hour to try and push it a little and it barely warm up . I run out of time but just run Windows 7 64bit it run at around 35c and the hottest I be able to get just cause 2 to push it be a max of 45c , and even then the fan do not need to speed up much . please note that this be only a day so far that I have it but so far , the improvement over my other card , the hd 4850 1gb be noticeable . the benchmark in just cause 2 be over 75 fp where the 4850 have 25 fp with the setting I choose to test it at . I have the setting turn up with the hd 4850 1gb but now I go to the max with this hd 6950 2gb and it do not even burp once ! awesome . I almost forget ... accord to the reading from techpowerup gpu-z 0.5-5 this new 6950 use less power than the hd 4850 do ! at least with the VDDC sensor log . I 'll have to check the other # 's . needless to say , I be not disappoint . I be very happy so far . I also fire up Assasin 's creed 2 and Bad Company 2 , with both run flawlessly . although I must note that the hd 4850 1gb do also run those two very well , now I can crank up the setting to the max and not lose any performance . I can not wait for battlefield 3 to try this card out on it !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this thing can run just about anything at max setting with little effort . I can run WOW in windowed mode while watch a blue ray on my 2nd monitor and surf the web at max setting and still get 60 + FPS . same go with every game I have throw at it . total overkill for most game but soooo worth it if you love gaming and want to play at the highest setting . now I just need to save up for a 2nd one and set it up in SLI . not sure what I would do with it , but it sure would be cool . -lrb- :
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	I install the card as part of my upgrade . the installation be simple and without issue . the card be not a good card for game playing , but be good for general use , and movie . great price . win 7 performance score be about 4.2 .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	for some reason , I just could not get this to work even after try two of these card and follow all the instruction to the t. I end up get the Gigabyte nVidia GeForce 210 1 gb ddr3 vga\/dvi\/hdmi pci-express Video Card gv-n210d3-1gus . that card work flawlessly and all I do be take the old card out and stick that one in and reboot .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have be run this video card for a few week now with no problem . I be not a big time gamer , but it do everything well that I need it to do .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I would like to give a proper review of this video card so that people know what to expect when they drop over 250 usd on a piece of equipment . First off , let I give you the specification of my system so that you have something to reference : - nzxt Zero 2 full Tower Case - Kentech 950W Power Supply - ASUS M5A88-V EVO Motherboard -lrb- AMD Chipset -rrb- - AMD fx-8150 8-core 3.6 GHz OCed to 4.1 ghz - G. SKILLZ PC14900 RAM 2 x 4gb 1866mhz -lrb- 8 gb total -rrb- - evga gtx 560 ti -lrb- ftw -rrb- 1.25 gb gddr5 320-bit SLI Ready - ASUS Wireless PCI Card - 1tb 7200rpm 64mb Cache SATA 6 gb hard drive - Cooler Master Hyper 212 Heat Sink w \/ twin 120mm 2,000 RPM fan - 8 cooling fan total - asus 24x dvd-burner - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit when I open up the box and take it out , the first thing I notice be how large the card be . obviously , if you plan on use slus then be sure to have a large case with plenty of room . do not use a mid-tower case with this card or you will run into problem . I have a full tower case and still have to make room for it . if you have lot of fan , be sure the wiring be do properly so that you have little trouble install . also , note that you power supply must have at least 4 MOLEX -lrb- 4 pin -rrb- connector free and able to reach near the PCI slot in order to power this thing . this card use lot of power and it be a good idea to make sure you will be able to both fit the card and wire it properly . I use the two 6 pin connector that come off of my power supply since all of my molex connector have fan attach . now let I go over what I think be the biggest problem with this card and what seem to be a issue for some people . once everything be ready to go and you have all the latest driver install , pop the disc they give you into you dvd drive and install the program call eVGA Precision X. this handy program allow you to easily manipulate several aspect of the video card include the speed of the fan , the speed of the memory and the voltage . this be almost a must since this card generate so much heat . the automatic fan control be not great so you will need to utilize this feature in order to get the most out of this card . I test this card with several game , the newest be new Vegas . I max everything out in the nVidia control panel and all the setting in the game menu . I have absolutely no problem with the frame rate and there be no lag at all . my previous video card lag at the highest setting , even with a AMD fx-8150 but this new card work flawlessly . I also test Crysis and Diablo 3 . all work great ... just sit idle this card can run at over 120 degree fahrenheit if you do not manually set the fan speed . if you max it out , it be loud . you will notice it . I usually set it at 70 to 75 % when watch video and max it out when play game at full hd . if you do not have loud speaker then the sound of the fan may interrupt you gaming experience , so be warn . you can maintain a ok temperature at lower speed but to get the most out of you card , try to maximize air flow with additional fan or set it to max rpm when stress it . all in all , this a great choice if you look to save a few buck . it do have some issue with the fan though so if you do not like noisy fan then it be not for you .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	i like this card it be good for gamee like world of warcraf i love it it be also good to have 3 moniter so i can molty task all at the same time
GraphicsCard	POS	4	im not gonna give a huge long technical analysis of this card , but it work great ! i have not hear of visiontek before and be a little leery of try a new brand , but it be the least expensive 7970 available . fortunately my money be not waste , it work spectacularly . i be run a 3 monitor setup with this one card flawlessly . only loss fp rate when run game on all screen , but even that do not effect the performance by much . i can play battlefield 3 on single monitor at 90 + fp easily , and 3 screen at 60 + . so all in all a great buy , i would recommend for anyone who want the true gaming experience
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I just want to say that I do alot of shop around for AGP card . and this one toke the cake . people be always complain about driver , and blue screen . I order this video card one afternoon , recieve it the next . Amazon beat newegg hand down on shipping , when I get the card it be not as huge as everyone keep say , but it be not a small card . plug it in , install the driver -lrb- very easy download from Sapphire -rrb- and voilum , it work like a charm . every game i have try be max out , no lag , over 100fp . mmo like Guild war and WOW be a little less , around 50 fp , but that be server , not this card . if you be look for a great , fast card to keep that agp system kick , this be it . do not let stupid people fool you with driver problem , just make sure you have a big enough PSU and 2 extra 4-pin plug , and you be set . this be the greatest investment for those age machine to keep up with the game of now Pentium 4 3.3 GHZ 1024 MB PC3200 RAM 500GB 7200RPM HDD ATI RADEON 3850HD AGP
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	it work okay but to use it in the manner I intend -lrb- multiple monitor -rrb- , I have to buy a $ 30 adapter for one of the port . the product description do not tell you about that .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	\*\*\* THIS CARD will take 3 slot instead of 2 ! edit - this card be great if you only plan to RUN one card , HOWEVER EVEN ON MY EXTENDED ATX MOTHERBOARD -lrb- I run on the asus iv rampage extreme-z -rrb- two card take up the entire BOARD of 5 slot ! if you run one monitor you will be SET with one card for sure , HOWEVER if you run eyefinity like me , XFIRE be GOING to be a have to THING SOON with unreal engie 4 in ORDER to keep it at OPTIMAL performance and with this card ... XFIRE be NOT possible on most motherboard comfortably which be QUITE IRRITATING to buy only to find you have to sell it in ORDER to get ANOTHER 7970 that size for xfire , just go with a reference card if you plan to XFIRE , you will be MUCH HAPPIER ! I receive this card about a week ago to go with my new upgrade for my desktop . this thing perform like a champ ! the dual bio switch be awesome because bio set 2 `` unlock '' the card to overclock it and if it crash anytime just switch it to bio 1 and you be good to go ! this card be large , but not any larger than the 6870 it replace in my opinion . I would however recommend get 1 card before purchase 2 to make sure you motherboard be big enough to take both card . I run the extended ATX Asus Extreme iv motherboard and I plan to crossfire 2 of they and will still have enough room for one slot for a wifus card or something small . card be amazing all around though and do not regret spend the $ 450 on it for a second , one of these will handle eyefinity at med-high setting which be what I plan to do ! ca not ask for more out of a grahic card !
GraphicsCard	POS	4	buy two at the same time , put one in my hp , and one in wife hp . hers work great and have have no issue yet . mine however like to over heat and turn my computer off , i change driver and have the issue much less , over all real nice product good for gaming .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be faster than most , DirectX 11 ready and require no auxiliary power . it run strictly off the pci-e video slot . under heavy load , it do not exceed room temperature and the fan be whisper quiet . plus , it be dirt cheap . no brainer . buy it .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	con : card itself be severely underpowered . will not play hd movie without stuttering , even with a quad core 3.2 ghz cpu , and 8 gig of ram behind it . do not even think of gaming on this , even on lowest possible setting . will not output to a phillips tv properly over dvi or hdmus . -lrb- this be a issue with some phillip tv and nvidium card in general -rrb- , require a registry change to make it partially work . pro : low price , handle normal window usage very nicely . very low power . this would be great for a person with a low budget that need to replace a dead video card , who only play facebook game , and use they computer for mostly work related stuff -lrb- surf the net , m word , etc -rrb- .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I get this card because a friend buy 2 not realize how big they really be . I be take a star for the fact that it feel completely cheap . I have get a xfx 7970 black edition which feel sturdy and wont even flex when you push it into the slot ; however , this one bend as if I be go to break it put minimal amount of pressure on it . that say though I be impressed !!!! the card be over clock friendly beyond belief , and it be cool as can be . there be a slight whine to it when you have it at 80 % fan speed or above , but its weird cause you can barely hear the fan , just a whine . I have get 65-70 fp at just a slight overclock in bf3 , where the xfx card can only hit a solid 60 . this card will get hot if I put it in the first PCI slot with the xfx below it , which be not surprising . all in all , I be quite worried about all the review claim it ship bust , but be quite happy when it work like a charm ! I get it replace my xfx card until I can get my hand on a beefier power supply but when I do crossfire it with the xfx card I be get a huge improvement over just a single card . I be completely impress with this card , just wish it have a little more of a backbone and be not so cheaply make . I 'll update if thing go wrong but as of now I would be happy to purchase another one of these card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the adapter card be install on a 2004 vintage computer run Windows xp . the video be now of similar quality to a brand new computer .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	my previous video card be a GeForce 8800 gt Alpha Dog Edition . xfx make good on the warranty previously so this be my second 8800 card . when it quit I need a quick replacement and be hopefull the gt 520 would live up to the expectation . I be wrong but could not financially afford a higher quality card at the time . I be still use the gt 520 but will replace it once I can afford . this be no fault of the retailer and I would recommend purchase from they , most definitely !!!!
GraphicsCard	POS	4	the reason I give 4 star be because this item be install in a client computer and after initial installation and testing , I will not have access to further inspection or use . this item ship and arrive faster than expect , install with ease , and once I update the driver from the evga website , it work like a charm on at least 2 high end game on the client machine . although there be no fan on this model , it be very easy to attach one to the exist heatsink -lrb- to help with cooling during game-play -rrb- . I recommend this item for people who be look for a good video card at a good price .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I uprgade my xp to Windows 7 and be in need of a pcus graphic card to provide win 7 feature and DVI output . the Sparkle card satisifed my need , as it provide a DVI output , and have sufficient performance for my need -lrb- I be not as gamer -rrb- .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I be able to adapt my old Dell Dimension 4400 computer to run dual monitor : one for the desk and one for the flat panel above my treadmill so I can watch streaming movie while I work out . it have just enough resolution to run both monitor in native resolution which make they very nice to use , whether for movie watch or productivity . this be one of my great computer stuff buy !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	have to get this GPU when I upgrade to Windows 7 . Works great with window 7 . Color setting be easy and give you plenty of option for most view need . Mine be use primarily as a Media Center PC , so I stream tv , movie to my hd tv . so far no complaint . would definitely recommend this for those who have older motherboard and need agp card .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	be stick with a motherboard with a agp video slot , I think I would be stick with 128mb vram forever , or until I shell out the buck for a new board . follow the recommendation of a mmorpg friend , I order this card . after install the hardware and the driver , I immediately load Age of Conan -lrb- which be notorious for laugh at sub-par video card -rrb- , and my jaw drop . the render speed and the detail be amazing . unlike a previous card buy from a third party , this one do not crash every 20 minute . I could not be more pleased . highly recommend .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I get the card in Oct. , 2010 . I do not see the fine print that say to register it to get two year support . recently I start get BSOD -lrb- Blue screen of death -rrb- . in other word , my computer stop and i have to reboot and lose whatever i be work on . this continue for two week . I try uninstall and reinstall driver and software . finally , i disabled the video card . no more bsod . so it be a bad memory on the card . I wish I have register it . that would have mean it be cover now -lrb- for 2 year -rrb- . if you get this card register it . however , I would not recommend that you buy this card . it only last 18 month ! and then cause I no end in grief figure out that the video card be cause my problem and not something else !
GraphicsCard	POS	5	after several day of read review here - I finally go with this card for my older Dell XPS desktop . the Dell AMD install card be just horrible consider XPS be suppose to be they `` better '' gaming type system . I only play wow and web surf . this video card jump my frame per second -lrb- fp -rrb- in WoW way up . in 25-man raid with spell graphic set high , I be maintain 45ish fp and in Stormwind around 80FPS . that be a huge improvement over the original card . one issue I have with this video card that actually make it make a very annoying cycling noise - be the fault of the Dell XPS case . above the card there be a metal crossbar that lock into place over the video card on the motherboard . well due the much larger size of this card compare to the original AMD card - the crossbar when install now compress the new card down to much and cause the annoying noise . after a week of wait to see if the noise would go away on its own - I open the case back up and just remove the crossbar all together . now its perfect - no noise at all ! also as one reviewer say - ensure you power supply have 2 free 6pin power connector - the card will not work with only one . great card overall without break the piggy bank - and if have a older xp system - this be great way to boost its performance and extend you system life .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the first card I receive from Amazon.com have some hardware problem -lrb- as explain by a evga tech -rrb- and I have to RMA . more detail : go to EVGA website to this thread : \/ forums\/tm . aspx ? m = 1644099 and so I tell Amazon I want a RMA Wednesday night ; a new card appear at my doorstep Friday morning . this new card be work great : and I be one very happy camper . ------------------------ now onto the review : pro : power : the evga 670 be a beast . I can run all of my game : include bf3 and my super heavily modded Skyrim max graphic in 1080p . and I average a fp of 70 + sometimes go into 110 fp . EVGA Precision X utility : it be really good . Easy to use , have a lot of neat -lrb- and actually really useful , not just gimmick -rrb- feature : such as test you card , change oc offset , manage fan profile , set target fp . it also have this awesome on screen display : it show the fp , gpu clock , temp , etc. as a overlay on whatever game you be play . it be better than frap . I can go uninstall frap now . : d con : the stock profile with this card run REALLY hot . and when the gpu get too hot -lrb- around 75c -rrb- it start to down clock itself . also , when run on full load -lrb- ex . bf3 on max graphic -rrb- the video card get kind of loud - the fan 's speed get really high . -lrb- edit -rrb- : and yes I know I can tweak the fan setting , and I have : though now its run even louder than before , but at least its not down-clocking . ----------- Final Thoughts : -lrb- my 2 cent -rrb- if this card -lrb- $ 410 -rrb- fit into you budget for a high end computer . get it , the 670 card be a beast . if you want good customer support \/ tech support , good software support -lrb- precisionx -rrb- , and a solid product , go for EVGA . if you want a quieter and cooler card , you might want to go for gigabyte or maybe even Asus\/MSI . obviously , I go for evga -lrb- and I do not regret it -rrb- , but keep you option open .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I upgrade from a 9800gt and now I can finally play skyrim without a problem . this card be pretty big so make sure you have room in you case for it . I have a x79 setup in a hafx-942 case so its a nice addition to the rest of the hardware .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	a friend ask I to upgrade he graphic card for he computer so that he could play game . there be one problem . he computer be a few year old . it only have PCI and AGP slot so I could not get the latest and greatest . I find this one and order it . the installation be a easy and I have no problem . after complete the installation I install call of duty and it work flawlessly .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	i get it like 2 week ago to replace my hd 5870 my 5870 be fine card i have to replace it because my new monitor lead Cinema Display 27 inch which it have only mini display connector and my 5870 do not so this thing crank my new monitor aggressively every thing be on max except the aa in battlefield 3 it cant run on 60 fp and i think everybody know that but when i turn AA off there be no difference my eye can catch but a huge improvement in performance 60 + fp and a massive ultra setting with 2560x1440 high resolution get this card you wont regret it and you may save some good cash and have 10 - fp by get on of those 7950 be just release i would get em if i do not get my new card by the way if i can measure my new 7970 with the 5870 i will say its equal for 3 5870 's in crossfire with 100 % scaling , i would not hesitate to get a new 7970 when i have the buck .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	this video card be amazing , i can run any video game ... 70-90FPS Battlefield 3 -lrb- 1360 x 768 , max OUT ULTRA , 4x aa , 16x af , full blur amount and field density ...
GraphicsCard	POS	4	win vista rate the the card a 4.4 on my hp . window aero rate it 4.4 on max quality setting same on the factory default . never try it on performance setting . have say that I really have nothing bad to say about the card , my game look great and I can even run game that say I need a bit more process power . for the price it be the best buy for a computer part I ever make .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	Easy install and great price make this a good buy . be Windows , Linux and Unbunto compatible . I run a dual boot with unbunto and winxpro3 and it install flawless . Unbunto surprise I by install it with driver and no cd be even need . I wish more review list what people use so I include that in my review . my system be a HP 2.6 quadcore 2gb ram and the 1gb videocard . Plays movie flawless and editing as other have mention be great . I upgrade from a Nvidia 9500 -lrb- not gt -rrb- and its night and day for the use . gaming , I can not review as I use Xbox and no need for pc gaming . the card be a plain-jane , no frill look like a video card nothing fancy with minus fan . funny the box it come in have more flare , but that advertising for you . for $ 50.00 you can not go wrong for those want a gaming card , I suggest look at higher end card . at $ 50.00 I be wonder what other expect in the way of gaming ? we family do have a AlienWare pc with a 8 gb video card , now that for gaming . and cost nearly $ 400.00 anyway you get what you pay for and its a 3000.00 pc for a basic all around performer this card seem good . I would buy again , temperature seem fine however would be nice if the fan be power through and cable and not the slot . Update : I recently in June 2012 upgrade to Win7 Ultimate , the card seem to work really well on this os too . no problem of any kid , the card have not fail or error-ed . one thing I be not aware at purchase be in win7 the 3d option come on allow you to view 3d movie with 3d setting if you have glass . another nice perk about this card I do not know be it work on just about any m base OS . good card great price .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	the video card install without any problem . I update driver to 12.4 and all seem great . card run cool and quiet . the problem start when I be use my browser . I would get screen flicker . this be not a issue in game that I could see . if I alt tab out of game to browse the flicker be much worse . I try all kind of fix with no luck . I decide to return the card and go with Asus instead .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I buy this two of these card as a upgrade from a 2x5750 atus card setup . I be quite impressed at price\/performance ratio of these card . a couple of note , the card be extremely long , make sure that you can fit the card in you motherboard before you attempt to jamalama the card into the drive . in addition , these card do not come with the Crossfire connector - you must buy it separately - it do not say it be include , so it be not . the card be reasonably quiet , and can be overclocked fairly easily with the standard atus software .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	hello folk , I pop in modern game like Operation Flashpoint - Dragon rise , which ask for a dual core . I have a single core 2.8 GHz Pentium IV . the game work great ! I will guess it be because of this great video card . my pc be something like nine year old ! the graphic card keep extend the life of my old bessy ! LOL Marc
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	I be very excited switching from my previous sapphire 4870 to this new model , and at first very happy with the performance , huge gap as you can imagine . trouble start a few hour after with a first freeze while play , I start to wonder about my computer , test everything , remove some harddrive , RAM module -lrb- testing with mem86 -rrb- wipe and re-install driver , swithe from one pcie to another , nothing would do , I be still get random freeze , mostly while play but also on the desktop , also I would see display corruption come back from sleep mode . intersting point it happen really random , I try to stress my system with free software out there use all GPU ressource and even CPU and MEM ressource at the same time , no luck , unable to `` trigger '' the freeze ... switch back to my previous card , magic ! no more issue ... -lrb- switch several time between the two card , same symptom -rrb- therefore I have no doubt the problem come from the card -lrb- or some kind of incompatibility with my system -rrb- after a few day search for my problem on the internet I find a interesting topic talk about issue while dual screening -lrb- my case -rrb- more precisely while dual screening DVI + HDMI -lrb- my case -rrb- , I think great ! I find my problem , but sadly ... still no luck and still problem even with one screen . at this point I be wait for my rma number to return the card , I fear I may have the same problem with the new one if it be link to my hardware -lrb- x58 platform win7 64 bit -rrb- I do not know , but this be the first time I be have this kind of issue and I be quite upset with sapphire .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	I be not sure how to review this product in term of its spec . so I will just mention my experience with it in ply Skyrim . when you be on the highest setting , the game might stutter from time to time . but after lower several setting -lrb- e.g. shadow detail to medium -rrb- , the game run flawlessly -lrb- even with the skyrim hd mod -rrb- .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	let I start out with a forward by say the card be a beast ! I upgrade from a mid-range 9800gt to this thing and get dx11 support , thrice the graphic process power , and a card that can run everything I can throw at it at 40fps or above . I do not really fancy the Dirt 3 that much , but hey , a free game be a free game . if you be into GPGPU application then this one be definitely a home-run hitter with its 2tflop compute power . mining bitcoin yield 250mh , although it falter when GPU render in Sony Vegas . however , the card be rather large . in fact , I have to rearrange some cable just to get it to fit in my case . regard actual performance ; while AMD be gain market share , the majority of game be seemingly develop for Nvidia . in fact , Deus ex Human Revolution , a game that be once often gifted with AMD card , suffer from periodic slowdown , even with this beastly card . the slowdown be not limit to this game , however , and be exacerbate by record with frap . also , the driver for AMD -lrb- namesake `` catalyst '' -rrb- be also notoriously inferior to Nvidia 's . the change be not aptly document enough , and I have yet to find how to maintain my image aspect ratio in game -lrb- all the information I find on Google be for driver at least 3 version earlier -rrb- . the molex to 6 pin adapter that come with it appear flimsy at first , you have to force the connector in a bit until it slip in . if either connector be not plug in you 'll get the fan run at jet engine speed and no display , although you usb device will be work fine . also , I would not count on that rebate . just assume it be money lose .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	the video card be incredible the graphic be wonderful . the card be gorgeous , and seem very well build . I could not believe the detail in Cyris 2 , and Max Payne 3 run the game perfect with no issue . the only problem be I do not know that you need at least 500 watt power supply to run this graphic card . if you have say a 250 like I do the card will not work . also the card get hot so I get new computer shell with better vent , and 600 watt power supply . other then that get one asap , you will not be sorry buying this wonderful gamer 's dream card . I almost forget to mention the first card send by amazon seem to have be a use one not the same card I believe , however amazon be nice enough to refund my money , and let I send back the wrong card at they expense .
GraphicsCard	NEG	2	this card run well as long as it be work properly . I replace my old Radeon 4890 power-color edition and there be a slight improvement from that when it come to run particular graphic enhancement in game . I mainly buy it so I would have dx11 since my old card do not . this be the second 6870 I have have to get , the first one be DOA , Amazon let I swap it for a new one . and after 2 month the card start have major graphical issue , random color pixel on the desktop , game be not even playable . I try the ` baking method ' as a last ditch effort to salvage the thing , this do not improve or worsen the card . I find it hard to believe I get two lemon one right after the other . I have contact Sapphire and in the process of return it for a replacement . I have already buy a new Nvidia EVGA GTX 560tus 448 Core Classified and it be run soundly .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	great video card , best out there at the moment . as well as receive great online rating -lrb- there be 2 that be better I think 580 and one other but the performance difference be so little and the price be double -rrb- . I get it so I can play video game at high resolution and stream they life online . the FPS go from 15 to 50 + with this card ! just a advice , if you do not know this already - get a power supply 600 watt be perfect . some people say 750 or 1k but 600 be more than enough why use more electricity when you do not need it . I get this one :  ocz ModXStream pro 600W Modular High Performance Power Supply compatible with Intel Sandy Bridge Core i3 i5 i7 and AMD Phenom
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	after see the tempting rebate-based price of $ 245 , I order a pair of these card . I be attract by they better price\/performance over Nvidias and they be also repute to run cooler . I also want to experiment with multiple monitor which the AMD eyefinity system appear to do much better than they competition . I be await the delivery of a dp port adapter before I can try this and may update this review later with the result . I be find these dual-fan 6950 be actually run about 20 degree -lrb- c -rrb- hotter when install in the same slot as my pair of single-fan Nvidia 460s . another attraction of these card be the dual bio which allow upgrade they to the spec of the AMD 6970 card but I can not attempt this while temperature be run high . in theory , anything up to 90c be ok but I experience a complete shutdown of the graphic card at around 80c -lrb- cpu continue to run fine -rrb- . the other difficulty I experience be that the spec list a Crossfire bridge as be include with each of the card -lrb- necessary to run two card link together -rrb- but neither card have the promise bridge and I have to find one locally in lieu of wait for day to get replacement . these card definitely perform better than the Nvidias they replace and I can now run bf3 smoothly in Ultra setting at 50 fp or I can run in high at 70 to 80 fp on my 120hz monitor . not too surprisingly , the rebate process seem design to discourage one from actually claim the rebate . first , nothing be say in the Amazon ad about the rebate be limit to one per household so half of my expect rebate be go the moment I try to apply . just find the rebate form on the Amazon site be quite a chore and then I be inform a copy of the invoice would be require . Amazon only send a miniaturize version of the invoice now which turn out to be a tiny scrap of paper about3x4 inch which have be tear off so that the invoice number be not readable . try to go online to find the invoice number be a ordeal of multiple menu that be not at all intuitive -lrb- I be a former software designer and this be one of my pet peeve -rrb- . I finally find where I could order a printout of recent order but after the report be complete , I receive a email that I could access it by go back to my Account on the Amazon site . old invoice use to pop right up but now view they involve open email , download a comma-delimited file , save it , and open it with a appropriate program -lrb- I do not have Excel -rrb- . and then you still have to print out the invoice copy , chisel the barcode off the box , stuff everything into a envelope and mail it off while hope you have not overlook some tiny detail that will be a pretext for refuse the rebate . I finally conclude that the $ 20 rebate process -lrb- already down from the expect $ 40 -rrb- be not even go to return minimum wage for my time and I move on to more important thing . I advise not be take in by promise rebate . they be too time-consuming to claim and too often in the past I have have they later reject on some tiny technicality . rebate go out of vogue for a while because they be cause too much ill-will for manufacturer but now they be creep back in we depressed economy . I have be burn in the past by they so shame on I for allow it to happen again .
GraphicsCard	NEG	1	the packaging for this say that it be Windows xp compatible . but it be not ! no driver exist anywhere that will run this card on xp . the installation cd even say `` Windows xp '' on the label . but when you try to install the driver , you get the error message `` driver be not compatible with this os '' . ASUS usually do well with they driver , support , and documentation , which be the main reason I choose this product . but they really drop the ball this time . this may be a great graphic card for Windows 7 or Vista , but I will never find out . I be return it to Amazon tomorrow .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I purchase this card for my old pc . I need to be able to output the pc video signal to my plasma tv , and this card do the trick really well . I particularly like all additional setting that allow you to squeeze out every single bit of usable pixel information on you tv screen - resolution , stretch , color depth , position adjustment , etc. . installation be very smooth and as easy as 1-2-3 . overall , it be a really nice product I be very happy with , I would definitely recommend it to anyone .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	I have a nVidia Geforce 8600g -lrb- pcie x16 -rrb- with two 27 '' monitor -lrb- Dell and Samsung -rrb- . I want to add three more 19 '' monitor but do not have any additional pcie slot . these Sparkle 8400 be a good alternative . I pop they in and add the three 19 '' monitor on the 8400 . they be slower for thing like re-sizing window and Netflix video playback , but since I be only use they as secondary monitor , it be fine . no compatibility issue as all video card be use the same geforce driver .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	good card , do what you would expect at a good price . plug in card , load driver -lrb- insert cd into CD drive and follow simple instruction -rrb- , work flawlessly without problem . later get automatic notification of newer driver update that be as easy to update as click on the `` install '' button . recommend purchase by desktop support it professional .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	my evga nVidia GeForce 7800 GTX 512 , once a oem-only benchmark smoking $ 750 + -lrb- in 2005 dollar : -rrb- -rrb- graphic card , have finally reach the point where new game be not playable at all , and new , entry-level card be begin to outrun it . it be only take 6 year . : d if you be look at this product , you be likely aware that the only thing it share with the gtx560 ti be the name . the rest of the hardware be a 570 with one additional multiprocessor disabled -lrb- possibly 570 chip with a core that do not pass muster -rrb- . great review of the underlie hardware be available from all the normal hardware testing site , so I 'll focus on the evga and classify portion of this card . I have deal with evga hardware personally and professionally for go on six year now , and can find nothing bad to say about the company . which be remarkable , come from I . you get the feeling , own they product , that they make the kind of product they themselves would like to own . they stand behind they hardware , offer awesome warranty -lrb- 5 , 10 or lifetime , depend on the hardware -rrb- and provide all the overclocking and monitoring tool you need . the classify card be large ; it take up all of the available space in my Alienware full tower between the drive cage and the PCI case slot . so much so , in fact , that I have to remove my ide cable for lack of a place to run it , and both card have to be insert at a angle , line up with the DVI port and rotate into place . seat and slot , there be just enough room for a SATA cable to lay between the drive cage and the end of the card . I install the card in my evga x58 slus 3x motherboard , pull out my 7800 . though the card instruction recommend installation in the 1st and 3rd pcie slot , I want dual-slot x16 bandwidth , not some hobble x16\/x8 monkey business . know better , naturally , I place then in the first two x16 slot . the fan side of these card , with the red stripe , be bow out , and when they be place in the adjacent slot , I find that they actually push on each other , cause a awkward sort of lean in the plastic bezel . but they work . so I fire up my system . installation of the driver be unremarkable , a couple of reboot later I be up and run . the problem I immediately notice be bring to light by evga 's own precision software . at idle -lrb- as idle as Aero get , at least -rrb- gpu2 be sit at a comfortable 37c , while gpu1 sweat up around 50c . launch a game with slus bring the temperature up . the cooling system in the card will rev the fan up to keep the temperature from exceed 70C , and gpu2 hit that . gpu1 go much farther than that . I consider water-boiling temperature to be too high for my comfort . play a older game like tf2 do not cause a problem , other than my concern that one card be 30C hotter than the other . run a directx11 demo program with tessellation utilize the card fully , however , and my system soon reboot itself . after the second reboot in two day , that little nagging `` install in x16 slot 1 and 3 '' keep come up in my mind , and so I do a little research about the impact of x16\/x16 versus x16\/x8 . I find that the expert note only a performance different of 5-6 fp in most game -lrb- and we be not run below 60 -rrb- . the SLI bridge make up a lot of the difference , it appear . so I move gpu2 to the third x16 slot and now both card stay about the same temperature all of the time , I have have no problem play game . with the notable exception that my mouse-tracking in some game have improve so much that I have to adjust my fp habit to compensate for the change . so the classify card be huge , they need a lot of juice -lrb- 6 pin and 8 pin on each -rrb- and I see no possible way to actually run three of these in slus without replace the heatsink with a waterblock to get rid of the heat . that be say , they be build for overclocking , and for the price of one of these card , you can speed it up to compete easily with much more expensive choice . and the evga logo on the edge of the card light up white . shame on evga for not print in they installation manual : `` no , stupid , I say use the 1st and 3rd slot . I do not care what you think you know about bandwidth as it apply to SLI , do what I say before you burn you house down . '' I be hope for another 6 year with this next generation of evga graphic card .
GraphicsCard	POS	4	product come in with all part and cable . install be easy . Monitor come alive as soon as I turn it on . upgrade from a 128mb card and what a difference . brought new life to my old Dell desktop . price be fair . I can now watch show on CBS.com in full screen and no lag when it hit hd broadcast . Play facebook game with no problem . only bad thing be that it would not upload new driver from disk that it come with . Got latest driver online .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	do not get I wrong this card be really awesome specially for the price , I have not OC ` ed mine -lrb- beyond the Saphire OC -rrb- as there be no need to for pretty much any game at 1920 x 1080 resolution , but this card have a great OC potential if you be into that . however it feel like some driver would really unleash the potential , ccc 12.6 beta be say to improve performance for the 7XXX series and it do improve it ! .
GraphicsCard	NEU	3	I have be use this adapter for about a week now and it be work , but it chew up most of my 4gb of RAM . I be go to upgrade to 8gb to see if that fix the lagging problem I be experience right now . unfortunately , I be use it for a trading set up off my laptop and I literally can not afford to have any lag time or slowness . my trading platform keep bang up against max memory available . I 'll update after I upgrade RAM to see if performance improve . if you have a more static need for a additional monitor , I would say this would not be a problem , but for a trader , this cost effective solution could be a very costly one indeed .
GraphicsCard	POS	5	great card for the money !! go in easy and very quiet . as to the dirt3 retrieval and activation process , it be about the same degree of difficulty as find a honest politician . endless crapware to download and then login\/logout\/product id 's \/ unique id 's \/ coupon codes\/re-register\/go here\/go there - yadayada then have the process deadend in nowhereville . design to frustrate as many as possible . I assume most will not make it accross the moat . update 12\/26\/11 - after several hour of dload on boradband I finally get to install the game on 12\/19\/2011 . when I go to play it on 12\/26\/2011 - it want to `` update '' for another 3 hour . rediculous . why not give out the right download the first time around ? like I say , big waste of time - free game ... right . card be still great - justy forget about the game stuff .

GraphicsCard	POS	5	I need a good card to upgrade my Dell so I could play some of the newer game . I be not interesting in pay a whole lot for it and when I check out this card , I note the number of people who say it be a good card . I have a Geforce 6200 with 256 of RAM I bring for a Compaq SSF Evo 510 and it work out great . this card prove to be worth every penney of what I spend on it . installation be easy and the the software installation be easy too . the extra video RAM help my 2.8 gig p4 a lot and be much better than the on board video . for the price , this card perform very well . one could spend more and get a better card , but for what I need it for it be perfect ! good card !!
GraphicsCard	POS	5	very happy with this graphic card . ive bean excite to buy this thing and im happy i finally do also im glad i buy this over the XFX one . the XFX card be annoying and the sound resemble a hair dryer . when use this card my case fan and hard drive be actually louder . i love this card so much and i recommend it to all . the performance be great and do not draw as much power as i think . be aware if you have a matx board that you may block a few sata port . but not a big deal , one more note the card be beautiful also do not get a dirt 3 code but that not a problem i do not but the card for the game . hope you all enjoy the card as much as i be .

GPS	POS	5	I use the Garmin 76CSX for both professional and personal purpose and think it be excellent . I have use the older version -lrb- Garmin Map76 -rrb- for year -lrb- 2004-2009 -rrb- and recently update to this newer version . Antennae reception be incredible ; I keep it in my pocket all day and the device rarely miss a point while record my daily track -lrb- hike range from 15-25 km\/day -rrb- . the MapSource software be also fairly good , and you can download you track and waypoint to google earth without any trouble . I do not geocache so I can not provide any input in that regard , but I imagine it would be well suit for it .
GPS	POS	5	what a world of difference have a gp device to guide we to unfamiliar destination on we recent trip . Tomtom be so accurate , we soon do not bother take the detailed road map and print direction along . we day of road trip with paper map be over ! Tomtom one be definitely worth the money . do not bother buy a $ 2000 + gp system integrate into you next car . Tomtom one will get you there for approximately $ 200 . a big bonus : you can use it in any of you car . Tomtom one be compact and fit easily in my pocket . a great buy !!!
GPS	POS	5	this be a very durable mount and the bag be weighty . I would recommend for a flatter dash in car . the hold device be quiet strong and durable with a nice strong grip . ca not go wrong .
GPS	NEU	3	Garmin have several feature that relate to the time of day . some example be sun & moon time , estimate time of arrival . if you have travel into a different time zone out of you original setting , the GPS unit leave it up to you to calculate the correct time base on you original setting . this be very inconvenient when you have travel from the west coast to the east coast thru four time zone . it also provide a problem when you destination be right on a time zone border . a cell phone automaticly change for time zone , but NOT a GPS unit that can calculate exactly where you be in the world ???? this be a Garmin overlook that I believe they should correct .
GPS	POS	5	we order this model instead of update and older one because we want the lane assist feature , it really pay off when we go to Florida in September .
GPS	NEG	2	I have own this unit for a couple of year , and I have upgrade the software recently as well -lrb- rev 5.4 -rrb- . I would not buy another gp of this model , and I have doubt about Magellan product in general after my experience with this unit . my reason be a little different than other reviewer . on my unit , the electronic compass be unreliable , and have to be recalibrate every week . this be particularly so if it be use around the electromagnetic environment of a vehicle , and whenever battery be change . most importantly , there be no warning that the compass need to be reset . therefore you might find yourself walk along a head that be completely inaccurate , without realize it . one of the key issue when use a unit like this be trust , and in particular trust when in the ` nearly lose , semi panic ' situation that we all hope to never find ourselves in . my unit fall short often enough that I can not trust some of the datum I be get . in a effort to improve reliability I have set the compass orientation to `` GPS course '' , so that when the compass fail , then at least the direction of movement on the map will be reliable . however I find it disconcert when ` head ' be so dramatically incorrect . evidently ` head ' be datum derive from the internal compass , and the unit be happy to give datum that be inconsistent with it be own datum from the GPS direction . for example , when walk quickly east , the unit will always accurately show my movement on the map as east , even when the electronic compass have lose calibration . however on the next screen the ` head ' will be label as a ridiculous 221 degree , or some other bizarre number , even when the unit be pointed directly along the eastward line of movement . it seem to I that it should be easy for the unit to be program to show a warn to the user that the compass be give inaccurate datum , since the datum from the unit be in conflict with itself . if such a warning be reliable , then I would at least know when the unit need recalibration . sadly , Magellan seem to have make no effort to accomplish this . without a internal check of the electronic compass I would not trust this unit to get I out of trouble . in some way I should have anticipate this . clearly , a gp should not be rely on for simple information as to which way north be . it be much better for pinpoint you exact location , ultimately the most important datum that a gp offer . therefore if I ever need to buy another gp I would get one that do not have a internal compass . it would be nice if Magellan be to offer a software upgrade that allow the user to turn off the internal compass , so that battery use would be lower and datum would be more reliable . spurious datum be worse than no datum at all .
GPS	POS	5	I love this gp ! ca not go wrong with garmin !! even let 's you know what lane you need to be in when drive in major traffic !!!
GPS	POS	5	I own a old 3.5-inch Garmin StreetPilot c340 for a few year . it be a good small machine , and still work , but it be screen be small , and the body be very thick . it be time to buy another thin and big screen Garmin , so I get a 5 '' Nuvi 1490-MLT . it have a huge screen , and thin body just what I have be look for . I have this gp for a few month already , but do not really test it yet . it be work just fine like my old pilot so far . the 1490 t model price have drop significantly , but 1490-LMT model be still expense .
GPS	POS	5	I love this Garmin product ! I own several Garmin product , and I have never have any issue with they ! my wife and I be avid biker , and use this every time we ride or go run !
GPS	POS	5	the only letdown from this otherwise fine gp be that you can not map out a route with multiple stop along the way and save it . that make trip planning with multiple stop a little mre challenge .
GPS	POS	5	what be great about it : Easy to Use & Understand ... Lifetime Maps ... Lane Assist be a Life Saver ... customizable ... Nice Interface I travel a lot , but where map and direction be concern , I be a dummy . I have always have problem in figure out where I be go , how to get there and how to get back . this be my first GPS unit and the process in select a good one seem confusing and difficult . call it good fortune , but after web research , I land on this one , and WOW , be I glad I do ! EVERY thing I have do & discover from the minute I get home and open the box have reinforce this great purchase . a few highlight . 1 . lifetime map ... rather than to pay $ 90 - 100 per year for map update , pay a little more upfront , get a unit that have the `` LM '' designation . with what little knowledge I have about GPS unit , this be my first great decision . 2 . Lane Assist and detailed `` junction View '' . keep you in the right lane , and a great split-screen view of highway junction as you approach they . as I say , I be a traffic dummy and these be the place where I always get lose , go or confuse ... but I have try this and it work . I just listen to what be be say , check the lane indicator and stay there until tell otherwise . I have the benefit of be able to test this in Los Angeles , San Jose & Portland - and I sail through each of these city with ease . 3 . customization ... when you go to the Garmin site , register and log in , you can then download different type of vehicle , voice and other nicety for you device . you can even create custom voice , such as you own ! map update ... the process take a few hour the first time . you do have to download they `` Communicator Plugin '' and the Map Updater first , after that , every thing go smoothly and -lrb- again -rrb- good for dummy such as myself . fit and finish ... during my search for a gp device , I look at all the major maker and find I find the look of the Garmin road and map a lot better than any of the other . I also like the stark design of the unit itself . it just look GOOD . this be a 5 '' unit and -lrb- for I -rrb- very easy to see & read . should you pay a little more and get a unit that also include Traffic capability ? for some , perhaps . I find this on sale for $ 127.00 and for that price , this be PERFECT .
GPS	POS	5	I be impressed and relieved know there be a 2yr warranty on this Garmin GPS watch I purchase . at least if something go wrong it can be take care of and I receive the papers in the mail shortly after purchase the Garmin watch .
GPS	POS	5	I own 3 gp , one garmin , one tomtom 910 and since yesterday a 510 . I use the garmin on the trail and the jeep , and my 910 have be with I for a couple of month cruise Europe and North America . I buy the 510 , because it be cheap and also base on my experience with the 910 . my wife want a gp in she car so I order it , in 5 min at work ... then , a couple of day later , while wait for the item , I start read the review and be stun by some of the negative comment ; 2 possibility , either I buy a lemon , or some people have no idea of what they be buy or how to operate a basic electronic device -lrb- like have the 12.00 flash on they VCR -rrb- ... after own the 510 for 10 day , I now believe that some people should stick to paper map ! pro : setup : 20 min , include download the update , and set up the bracket on the windshield of my wife car . navigate the menu be a breeze . reliability : perfect . not one reboot ... the 510 will even navigate through some forest trail in the mountain . pous : plentiful enough ... Bluetooth : synch it with my blackberry pearl the FIRST TIME !!! con : none so far ...
GPS	NEU	3	I buy this unit over TX Giving sale . the primary reason be that my other Garmin c330 gp be get dated and for the price of new map I could get this -lrb- with lifetime update -rrb- . set up be fairly easy . user interface do not take long get use to . during the trip it have nice trip summary such as mile left , time leave , upcome exit with exit # in top right corner . I have only make one long trip with this gp and even though I have fastest route set on , the GPS pick some really small road towards the end of the destination . I be follow a route that I have already travel on so I choose to ignore the GPS . it re-calculate fairly quickly . overall it be a good buy for the money
GPS	POS	5	if you be interested in the GPS aspect of the device , you can read the other review -- like they nearly all say , the 205 and 305 be excellent . I want to specifically point out how much improve and how accurate the heart rate monitor and strap be over the previous version -lrb- forerunner 301 -rrb- , as well as how favorably the 305 hrm function in comparison to the benchmark Polar monitor . the 305 have not drop my heart rate once in nearly three week of daily workout range from one to two hour . I have and have use the 301 for the better part of a year , and continually have problem with interference , which cause extend datum dropout and extremely high , inaccurate reading . the 305 be nothing like the old 301 , which be reason enough to purchase if you require a solid hrm with you gp datum . a side benefit -- it be accurate ! I have compare it with my Polar Accurex monitor , and it be dead on . if anything , the Polar update a bit slower than the Garmin . all in all , a huge improvement , and a great product . highly recommend . also , as a number of other reviewer have say , get the SportTracks software . it be free and it will greatly enhance the viewing of the datum from you new ForeRunner 305 .
GPS	POS	5	I have try several other mount platform -lrb- suction cup , vent mount , spiderpodium -rrb- and hand down , this unit be better than all of they . it be extremely stable and the phone can be use in both portrait or landscape mode . great product .
GPS	POS	5	the TomTom GPS work great . the only problem I have notice be that the map software be out of date . buy the map upgrade do not do any better in direction . I would still buy this item over other gp manufactor .
GPS	POS	4	we buy two of the GPSMAP 76Csx model for we resource staff . after work with the device for a few week , I decide to purchase my own to replace my aging GARMIN eTrex Vista The 76Csx be go to be a great tool for we wetland delineation process . although of low reolution and scale the ability to load the MapSource 1:100000 map will provide a little more detail than the base map . we use DNR Garmin to transfer these point between the device and we arcmap \/ arcgi software . this easily allow we to display we field map coordinate in a geo-referrenced satelite image environment for plan purpose . be able to change datum on the fly be important for we vary datum format . I only wish the unit would accept more text annotation and display it in the mapping software . this would be more useful for discusion of individual point datum .
GPS	POS	4	my plan be to only use this gp unit when I be chart out new course , but I be find myself always strap it on now ! it be less cumbersome than I expect and work very well . out of about 20 run , it lose contact with the satellite once for about one mile - otherwise it have be faultless . it take about 3-4 minute to initiate contact when turn on and you need to leave it someplace still while it be find the satellite .
GPS	POS	5	have upgrade from we old Garmin nuvus this Model be awesome !!! I buy this for my boyfriend for Valentine 's day and now I want one LOL . the large screen be great , the voice command need some work however give simple command it do just fine . overall I be very happy with this Garmin .
GPS	POS	5	after be show how to use this watch by a friend who have the same one , it be so easy to use . I like simple electronics for timing and distance so this be perfect for I . after a little while , I do not notice how large this watch be . do lot of research and this be the best run watch for the feature and price accord to hundred of review - even compare to newer model . great value .
GPS	POS	5	I decide to purchase this watch to help I train for a half Marathon . what a great training aid ! this watch can do just about anything you can imagine . naturally , it record you precise pace and distance , which be helpful , but it also allow you to set up a advanced workout . for example , if you be suppose to run 3 mile , then run 4 2 minute aerobic interval and then run another 3 mile , you can program this on you watch so that while you be run , the watch will notify you when you need to speed up or slow down . the watch also come with a heart rate monitor . after each run , I like to review how I do on each section of the training -lrb- i.e. pace , heart rate , etc. -rrb- the program be easier to set up on you computer than on the watch , but once the software be install , it be very user friendly and just take a couple of seconds to sync to the watch . I never run without the watch anymore ! the watch also have mode that be specific to other activity such as biking , but so far I have only use it for run . I would highly recommend this watch for anyone who be serious about training for a race , or even someone who just want to have a easier way to monitor and improve his\/her workout .
GPS	NEG	2	we use this on trip to Italy and Iceland and find it be unreliable enough that we use paper map and avoid this when we could . we have a earlier Nuvi -lrb- 255 -rrb- that we like , so it be not the overall brand . there be two type of problem : - it reset itself without we do anything . my guess be that when there be momentary blip in voltage , it sens the charger be unplugged and replugged , it reset itself and usually take a couple of minute to go through the Garmin screen to be useful again . the cigarette lighter charger connection be flaky enough that a device need to be tolerant of such change . -lrb- this happen in 2 rental car , so it be not a bad cigarette lighter . -rrb- the same thing happen when the usb connection in the back of the GPS be bump . on a highway the reset might not be a big deal - but when you actually need it in navigate italian city , have it stop work be a major problem . worse be when sometimes it would show a startup screen -lrb- show a icon of it connect to a computer -rrb- and it would not restart itself - usually hold the power button down would get it to stop so we could restart it , but several time it just hang . - in italian town and city , it would tell we to turn the wrong way on 1-way street -lrb- happen twice in Cremona -rrb- . more subtly -lrb- this I can understand , but it be a notable concern -rrb- , it could not differentiate between medieval street and major boulevard : it would have direction zigzag through the narrow street that be charming when you be on foot , but really should not be navigate by anything larger that a Fiat 500 or Smart car - and subsequently we would find that we would start a block from a main road that a human would have direct we to . again , a paper map be preferable .
GPS	POS	5	I have have some reservation after read the worst review -lrb- that it be too big on the wrist , the speed be erratic , it take too long to get the map etc. -rrb- . it be true that it be quite bigger than a watch -lrb- but then who expect a small size ? -rrb- , but the size be not prohibitive . the forerunner pick up map quite quickly -lrb- although I must say that I do try it in a small town with not many tree or big building -rrb- . finally , the speed be always accurate . overall , I find this watch a great exercise tool outdoors . I can not vouch for its software as I do not use this function . one thing be that it be clear the price go down . I pay $ 150 and now it be $ 128 . as with all electronics , the more you wait the less you pay .
GPS	POS	5	I update from a 4.3 inch screen . really nice unit , I use it to travel the Midwest in my work ! the price be right & shipping be fast . I be very satisfied !
GPS	POS	5	I delay buy the 305 because I really want a gp watch that could report cadence . I consider the Polar rs800g3 , but it be more than twice the price and not as easy to use . I consider wait for the Forerunner 405 , but I be start a new season and do not want to change run log mid-season . so , I buy the 305 for less than $ 220 and add the foot pod -lrb- $ 80 -rrb- a week later . I plan on use the foot pod for indoor workout . my first run with it be on the treadmill . although the distance report differ slightly , it be fairly close without calibration . when I download the datum to my computer , I be surprise that it have record cadence ! but I pessimistically assume that it would not work when the gp be in use . my next run be outdoors , and to my surprise the 305 record cadence and gp distance at the same time ! I be even able to change the display to show cadence during my run . that be how easy it be to configure ! this watch greatly exceed my expectation ! I strongly recommend it for any serious endurance athlete !
GPS	POS	5	I purchase one of these almost a year ago , product have be excellent . I have use the mount on my dirt bike in very rough terrain go very fast , no problem . I have have this mount on my mountain bike in Moab , UT no problem . I ride my dirt bike one to three time a week over rough trail with this mount and no problem . when I go to a wma on my mountain bike and ride for a whole weekend I never have a problem . I think the people where the GPS fall out after two small bump and such do not install the mount correctly . I never write review unless a product real impress I and this one do . I have purchase two so I do not have to keep switching hardware between my dirt bike and mountain bike . this be a great product .
GPS	NEU	3	I purchase this gp approximately two year ago and have have to replace the 12v electrical cord and the back plane mount device already . I use the device while on vacation . total time use while on maybe three dozen time . the external electrical connection be not very rugged . I have to hard wire the antenna as the fold down unit do not reliably maintain satellite connection . think twice before purchase ... only at a severe discount .
GPS	POS	4	so far we have be very pleased with the Magellan RoadMate 760 . we have try it out on a roadtrip and locally and seem to be right on the money . like the feature that tell you the length of time to complete the trip at the speed you be go .
GPS	NEU	3	the map be at least 2 year out of date . it be not 100 % correct but be more useful than not .
GPS	POS	5	as a native New Yorker , I have become a direction snob . I know my way around the subway system , as well as the highway and bi-way of the City . but then , I move to Atlanta , where there be over 100 street name peachtree-something . I carry road map in various place in my car . I purchase the Garmin nuvus 3790LMT GPS Navigator for its ability to navigate road and re-configure route on the fly . and while it be true that several top-of-the-line gp unit can do this , no other unit do the task as well , with as little heft , as do the 3790LMT . this unit be thin and lightweight - two stats that matter when the pull of gravity to a await floor can destroy heftier GPS unit . the feature-packed 3790lmt afford I a lifetime of traffic and map update , as well as Bluetooth connectivity . the unit pair flawlessly with my iPhone , and its voice command `` understand '' I better than my first wife . the setup be easy and intuitive . within minute I be ready to connect the 3790lmt to my MacBook pro and download the most up-to-date map of North America available . the 3790lmt work whatever mode of land transportation you prefer - automobile , bicycle or pedestrian . and it allow you to maximize fuel economy , and save you precious time as well . there be super expensive gp unit for the nerd-acious and for the gadget friendly who love the challenge of difficult programming . the Garmin nuvus 3790lmt be the GPS unit for the rest of we .
GPS	POS	5	first time I use my forerunner 305 -lrb- hour outta the box -rrb- , I achieve a pr run a 4 miler by 3:30 !!! great training partner . ca not wait til the Philadelphia Marathon !!!
GPS	POS	5	the Mio c220 be everthe that be write about it . the Mio arrive ready to use straight from the box . there be certain combination of option that you have to tweak for you personal use , once accomplish you will truly have a remarkable and affordable gp unit . I read many comment prior to buy the c220 . the few con that I read about the product , -lrb- I be convinced -rrb- , be due to incorrect setting . once you have the correct combination of type of road you will use , or the route you prefer , -lrb- fast , economical , or most direct route etc. -rrb- , I have find it perform without question as the best unit at the best price . I would definately recommend this unit to everyone .
GPS	POS	5	I get this as a gift for my girlfriend who be old GPS die . this one update on the computer and after that it be ready to go . it give live traffic and good suggestion as to different route to take if the traffic get too heavy . I like the feature of how long to reach you destination , and the map cover all area that some of my other gp device do not .
GPS	POS	5	try this unit after I find out the `` new '' Garmin eTrex Legend H only output proprietary Garmin datum -lrb- original eTrex Legend will output nmea datum -rrb- . this make it useless for software other than Garmin 's own overpriced version . after speak with the rather rude rep at Garmin , I decide to look elsewhere . I already have and be happy with Streets & Trips and share trip file with friend and family member . I try another data-conversion software to allow use of the Legend h , but it be simply a hassle . this one hook up seamlessly and acquire satellite much more quickly than the Legend do . since I only need a unit to feed the notebook with s&t; s , this be ideal . it be quite small and have a small suction cup with a cable slot to hold it steady on the dash , if you do not care to use the magnetic back . it use only a tiny amount of power through the usb port ... in fact , I have run it on a old notebook with a PCMCIA usb adapter and Windows 2000 and it work perfectly . the usb cable be longer than the Garmin unit , also . I order a replacement for the original eTrex Legend to use on hike and to save track when not in the truck -lrb- still have all the add-on and adapter for it -rrb- . the original unit last 5 year and the replacement be still that same unit , so it 'll work through a serial adapter to usb in a pinch . too bad Garmin seem to have become so greedy as to force use of its software . the vendor ship it quickly and it arrive in perfect condition .
GPS	POS	5	I check all the review on as many site as I could find and all of they recommend this gp . I would not use the compass so I do not buy the 60cxs unit and this one come with a compass but you have to be move to make it work . it arrive when they say it would and Amazon have the lowest price . if you add the mapping software , it give you direction the same as a car unit but do not talk to you . I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who into geocashing , biking , walk or any similar activity .
GPS	NEU	3	I have just purchase this item and be disappoint at the way Amazon be market this . they retail price say the unit be list for over $ 700 and the Garmin site have it for a little over $ 300 . they also list a very limited number leave for sale -lrb- 1 item leave -rrb- that do not drop when I buy mine ... it be still a good deal on a great unit , but I think Amazon be better than this !!!
GPS	POS	5	this thing be great !! I have be use NeverLost -lrb- Magellan -rrb- in rental car for a few year and want my own . the Magellan have better selection for route , i.e. fastest , Shortest , most use of freeway , but the Nuvi be great . small , great battery life , good direction . I use it to find the Hess Collection Winery in Napa and trust I , that place be nowhere !! would have give up be it not for `` Jill '' tell we to keep on go . great device .
GPS	POS	5	it do everything I expect it to do and they some . I have use it for over a month now and it have not freeze up once . the other brand `` nextar x3-02 '' I try freeze up several time each trip . the cost at Amazon be the best I find . one to two hundred dollar less the all the big retail store . I would recommend that you download the manual from the Garmin web site and read it . every review I read that say it would not do something I be able to find out how to do it by read the download manual . I do have to call the support desk to find out how to set a location as my start point other then the one I be located at , so that I could map a route form that other location . I be able to get a person after a 20 minute wait . better then the average support telephone # form today 's service department . and the person I speak with be helpful and knowledgeable . he explain how to view the map with the GPS off , go to a location and then pick set location . the manual tell how to set a location but do not explain that be what need to be do to route a map form some location other then you current location . the manual be a must if you want to get the most usage out of you unit . I would recommend this unit to anyone that want a dependable unit .
GPS	NEU	3	I be happy overall with the product . pro : Easy to use . con : Garmin advertise City Xplorer software for certain city on they website . this software show all available transit type for that city and the route . they do say not all city have this information . from Amazon.com `` include advanced navigation feature to take the worry out of travel , include cityxplorer pedestrian map '' . I order City Xplorer for Houston from the Garmin website . there be no disclaimer list for that city . I could not find any bus route . I call they help line which be very polite and willing to help I . it end up that the person help I have to call 3 different place within the company to get a answer for I . there be only 3 city that include bus information . they be all in Europe . they refund my money without my have to ask for it . it do show the closest bus stop to you location but if you do not know you way around the city this be not helpful . it do show the Metrorail . this feature be why I choose this particular brand and model .
GPS	POS	5	I buy this gp for we trip to south and the experience be wonderful . ease of enter address , select we favorite place , real time map and voice prompt help a lot ! we never get lose . Wish total trip summary be display before start of drive . a solar charger will also be a great help when wire charger get lose !
GPS	NEG	2	the description say '' ... you TomTom EASE guide you door-to-door with turn-by-turn speak instruction INCLUDING STREET NAMES . '' it do NOT speak street name . this be word so carefully so as to cover they ass but it be deceptive .
GPS	POS	5	I decide to purchase this Garmin for my upcoming trip to Rome and Venice . I be attract to it because of its european map , as well as its pedestrian -lrb- walking -rrb- mode . I be a little hesitant at first as some give it mixed review , but I decide to take the plunge . well , I just return from Europe have use the Garmin nuvus 1370t extensively in my travels and all I can say be WOW !!!! before my trip , I download the City map on the Garmin site for both Rome and Venice . this give you very detailed information for the individual area you be go to and I would recommend do the same if you be go to be walk around . remember , this unit do come with Europe install so this add on be just more detailed information . walk around Rome and Venice be a joy with the 1370t . my family and I walk everywhere and never get into a taxi . people be ask we direction after awhile ! I find that we would venture out in any direction we want because we know we could always make we way back . it help you plan you trip give you the most interesting site to see in and around where you be . in Venice , everyone be glue to the map in they hand . they have to stop at every intersection because it be so easy to get lose in that city . even look at the map in they hand , they be still lose ! the Garmin allow I to explore with ease and not have to stop at every turn to reacquaint myself to where I be . now be this thing perfect ? here be the deal . in Rome and Venice , you be surround by tall building that cause problem for the gp reception . that be not Garmin 's fault , it be just the reality of use a gp receiver . in both city , you lack of reception last only a small amount of time and then you will enter a better reception area and you unit will update itself pretty quickly . lose reception , while walk , be really not a big deal . you already have you way map out on the screen , so you follow it even though it may not be update you precise position . this be a absolute must buy for those travel . I have also use the automobile mode and it be outstanding ! here be a few wish list for future update . in walk mode , you do not know which way to begin walk . you have to walk a small amount in a direction , look at the screen and see what direction you go , then adjust to the way you be suppose to be go . this be a bit frustrating . next , when you in a unfamiliar city , it would be nice if the unit could give you some restaurant recommendation base on user review , price etc. . right now , it give you a list of all the restaurant , but in a unfamiliar city with a family , it would be nice to narrow that list down . in walk mode , I want to know how much longer I need to walk -lrb- in mile or part of mile -rrb- to reach my destination . it give you this information in automobile mode but not in pedestrian mode . bottom line : this unit will help you explore with confidence and reduce you stress while travel so you can spend more time enjoy you vacation !
GPS	NEG	2	purchase in March ' 12 . bad connection w \/ charge mechanism within gp to start with . map update become available and everything become a big mess ! file go miss , have to contact Garmin via several email & countless phone call . just one big headache . also buy a car charger that the cord split within 2 mo . and be return a `` refurbish '' one . spend a little more $ $ $ and hopefully get a better product .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin 305 have be a excellent enhancement to my workout . I use it for run and biking and i can not wait to take it on my next ski trip this winter .
GPS	POS	5	how can people slam the Legend when it can be pick up for less than $ more than the basic etrex ? I use the basic model for over a year , love it , then buy the Legend . I be delighted with all the extra option . the high re screen , much better than the original etrex . I love that I can upload my waypoint and track from my old e-trex and download back to the new one . the pan map be a nice addition as be the calculator and calender . I think some people want it to perform like a $ 1000 unit but only pay $ 150 - do not listen to they . my only complaint be that the click-stick be not on the right side .
GPS	POS	4	I know many of we be go crazy try to figure out which of the latest trucker gp unit be the best value . I have it down to two for many reason . I will go into why in another review when I make my final decision . no one have write anything -lrb- that be no user -rrb- about the Rand McNally tnd-710 . but I will because I just order it . I have be use this one -lrb- the Garmin dezl-560 lmt -rrb- lmt just mean include free lifetime map and traffic update . the lt will cost you to update the numap -lrb- that the mapping co -rrb- after 60 day from purchase . its worth get the LMT model for the lifetime update of map . do not get that confuse with software update to fix glitch ... they be always free . now about the lifetime traffic . well the receiver it come with that be build into the power cable be free because it throw up advertisement at you now and then . I hate advertisement ! I call Garmin which have excellent support as do rm and they say the non-ad power -lrb- the traffic receiver be build into the power cable -rrb- cable will cost a extra $ 120.00 and if you want premium traffic and construction service add $ 49.00 to that . WOW the only thing I can say good about that be its a one time fee . now to add traffic and speed camera update that $ 25.00 per year . let add this up . I pay $ 459.00 for the unit -lrb- 560lmt -rrb- on Amazon . $ 70.00 for accessory -lrb- Micro sd , Case , Windshield mount , Dash mount -rrb- $ 170.00 for traffic receiver power cord with prem software and $ 25.00 for the first year of camera warning . that $ 724.00 all together if you want all the bell and whistle as I always do . by the way all that ado about get add-free traffic ... it suck anyway . the traffic predictably be poor at best . just turn it off so you do not see the advertisement . save the $ 170.00 . maybe it will get better . its a 3rd part co so its hard to say . rm -lrb- Rand McNally -rrb- say it will offer a similar traffic receiver and service in June when there external antenna , case and other accessory come out . right now rm only offer map update for one year so its hard to say what the end cost of this unit will be . I want the best ! ... so I be spend alot to find out . DieselBoss be the only retailer I could find that be take the time to compare these two unit . check it out . http:\/\/www.dieselboss.com\/truck_gps_review_features.htm . the info be still come in about the garmin but I agree with what they say about the Garmin so far . . I buy the Garmin here on Amazon ... best price . I have own or use 5 other gpss to date . Garmin dezl 560lmt -lrb- same as lt but no lifetime traffic -rrb- pro ... \* start , route and re-route fast 10-30sec , no lockup yet \* -lrb- great route so far ... this be the most important feature about any TRUCK GPS . -rrb- \* show the post truck speed of most road next to you speed that turn red when you go over . \* -lrb- Garmin have a unbelievable database -rrb- every address I enter it have . this be not true of Google or even my co-pilot -lrb- pc-miler -rrb- . \* loud Speaker . \* quick access to brightness control . Easy snap-in mount -lrb- no usb plug to plug in every time which can break -rrb- \* Lane asst ... yea ... love that . \* lot of fun stuff and voice you can add from the garmin and 3rd party website . con ... \* 5 '' I want 7 '' . \* do not show the name of cross street as you pass they . \* you can not just pan & zoom on the nav map . you have to go to a special map screen . \* ETA do not adjust or work well at all ... but its so bad i be sure they will fix the software soon . my co-pilot ETA work perfectly . \* you can not show ETA and MTD -lrb- mile to destination -rrb- at the same time . Booo ... I want both ! . \* the graphic could be better . co-pilot be Sweet look . sound like I be work up Co-Pilot ... lol ... I be not . poor poor Truck map almost every time with Co-Pilot ... DON `` t buy . over View ... the hardware be rock solid , no freeze here and it re-route you fast if you miss a turn but I wish they have a 7 ' . \* the Software be very good for truck mapping and address thanks to garmin extensive datum base but need improvement on the stuff that not as important but convenient . I will update this as I learn , use and remember more . go on 3 day trip tomorrow . md-in-nj-dc-md let see what Rand McNally bring to the table with the tnd710 . I can not wait to get it .
GPS	POS	5	this be actually a gift , but the recipient love it . she have a Garmin before and she say this one be much better ... now that could be because she be tell I that and I give it to she and she do not want to hurt my feeling , but I have notice that she have not use she Garmin since she get this one . you be the judge ...
GPS	POS	5	I purchase the 350 nuvus after much research , include reading review . I just take a 2400 mile trip across the US , include Yellowstone and other site out west . the nuvus be only inaccurate a couple of time and that be when I take what appear to be newly open road . it be definitely useful , but you also need to pay attention to the road sign . I especially love that nuvus give warning about upcome turn and advance warning when you need to be in the right or left lane before a turn . we have start use the nuvus for geocach and it have be right on ! it be also useful when arrive to a destination early -- I be able to look up hotel further down the road and make a new reservation ! what a timesaver . I will not travel without it again !
GPS	POS	5	I be so pleased with the rooCASE Neoprene Sleeve that I will buy more to protect other item that I have . it be very protective , very attractive and do the job nicely . it fit my gp like it be make for it .
GPS	POS	5	look no further , I want to find more information about this watch and do some more extensive research before my purchase . then I stumble onto this blog by dc rainmaker and I be sell ! this review be the most informative review I find so far . I have have the watch for almost a month now and I love it and get exactly what I expect from the review . great training device , and most importantly I think the watch make the run that much more fun . -lrb- ... -rrb-
GPS	NEG	1	I buy this Garmin because it seem like it would be easy to use . my daughter have a 350 and she love it . but I do not love mine . it only hold a charge for about 2 hour , it do not come with any external battery charge except a vehicle power outlet cord and when I plug the GPU unit in it immediately go into charge mode and will not operate . same thing when I plug it into my desktop comptuter at home -lrb- with a usb cord from my camera , since one be not supply with the Garmin . -rrb- when it be charge , I can not do anything else : no naviagaion , no download waypoint , nothing . plus , it doen ' t know where anything be ! it send I way out of my way or onto dead end street try to get anywhere ! I do not know anything about other GPS unit , but if they be all like this , who need it ?? I 'll just go back to my old way : highway map and print out from Google map -- they be more accurate anyway ...
GPS	NEG	1	never pick up satellite signal to change from default Chicago location . too bad -- seem like good combination of feature and customizable tools\/preferences .
GPS	POS	4	I use this 4.3 '' version in my car ; the 5 '' version would be just a bit too large . pro : \* the gp be easy and logical to input address into . it also quickly find every address I have put in so far and the give route be very reasonable to I , give my knowledge of the area and road . \* the touch screen be very responsive . \* the suction cup and mount bracket work very well . no adhesive need on two different car . \* both the mount bracket and the power connection be magnetic and work better than I anticipate . fast and trouble-free connect and disconnect . \* the screen seem fine and normally responsive in cold weather -lrb- -10 f -rrb- . \* you can connect the gp to you pc and the internet to get free lifetime map update . First you Download and install the `` mytomtom support application '' . then you connect you gp unit to you pc and turn on the GPS . then the TomTom software open you default browser automatically and load you TomTom account page -lrb- once you have a account -rrb- and give you a status . this be also dependent on if you have you browser cookie save for TomTom -lrb- you can use a white list if you regularly discard cookie -rrb- . when connect and update map , you browser window say `` TomTom GO -lrb- model number -rrb- '' , then `` install ... '' . quite logical and easy to use . \* on certain screen you can control map with finger swipe and 2-finger zoom -lrb- similar to a iPhone -rrb- . \* the screen be very bright and can easily be see in intense daylight . there be a night mode -lrb- that it can switch to automatically -rrb- and the screen 's brightness be adjustable . \* it display the speed limit on that section of the road . it be very accurate on both where the speed limit change and what it be . this help I with the age old question : `` what be the speed limit here again ? '' \* Traffic Information feature : this can recalculate you trip time , and suggest alternate route , depend on traffic . this feature could be great , but it appear to not be available in my city . on the TomTom website you can get a list of city available . my city be not list . the car power cord have a traffic receiver build into it -lrb- when you connect the car cord it say `` rds-tmc receiver connect '' -rrb- . while I be not really sure how this feature work technically , the manual say that the gp display traffic datum with red indicate congestion and green show no problem . pro with limitation : \* the manual be extremely easy to read and get you start fast . it explain the GPS graphic well . most of the GPS menu be intuitive and with a bit of work you be good to go . however , the manual do not go into great detail of all the option and setting . for basic task this be not a big deal as they be fairly obvious . however , there be a few option that take I forever to find -lrb- see below -rrb- . \* the unit have the ability to use command speak by you . for example , `` calculate a alternative route . '' when work , it be great , but it have a few major stumbling block . first , it take I forever to figure out how to turn on the speak command option . it turn out it be bury under the `` make you own menu '' option and a check box of `` voice command and control . '' it be nowhere else . not obvious ! next , the unit do not give on-screen prompt for what command work , so you have to know this . to view a list of voice command , you go under `` help '' in the Main menu , then `` Product manual '' and then `` what can I say ? '' again , not obvious . \* this unit have Bluetooth -lrb- BT -rrb- for link a phone and use hand free . the speaker quality and dial portion work well . but this BT feature have its problem . when the GPS be turn on , it find the paired phone . it then automatically retrieve the phone 's current contact . so far so good . however , when you display the contact , the phone number be okay , but it list all the name as a bunch of number -lrb- a software bug no doubt -rrb- . where 's Joe ? or Betty ? very aggravate . you can only find they by they phone number . so the import phone book be pretty worthless because of this . some quick web search seem to indicate this be a common problem . further search have not come up with a solution for my gp model at this time . con : \* power up and down . some car have power a -rrb- go to they cigarette lighter -lrb- cl -rrb- adapter only when the key be turn on , b -rrb- other car power the cl all the time , regardless of the key position . it would be nice if this unit adapt to both kind of car . for example , for key car the unit do not power up when power be apply via the car 's cl adapter . this feature would be handy so when you start you car , the gp start . it have shut down cover though , as it have a option for the GPS power after 10 seconds if no power be come from the cl . for constant power car , it would be nice to have a option to have the gp turn off when you car have not move in 10-20 minute . that way the GPS would turn off when you park and leave . while you should probably un-mount the gp while parking on the street for theft reason , this would take care of you garage parking , etc. . of course power on will not be cover , but you can always hit the power switch . \* it do not have any sd or microsd card slot . some people might find this a limitation as other unit have it for audio file , etc. . minor con : \* when connect to a pc , it start off flaky ; sometimes work , sometimes not . the problem seem to be a software driver issue -lrb- I have Vista -rrb- that finally fix itself after I let Windows find a driver on its own . it take several try . \* the unit use a proprietary connector on the supply cable . it be not a Mini-USB . this might be problem only if you lose you cable . \* polarize sunglass can impede you view of the GPS screen . however , this be fairly normal with electronic screen , so not particular to the TomTom brand itself . helpful hint : \* the unit can occasionally have a software hang-up -lrb- as do most brand , so this be not unique to TomTom -rrb- . to reset , press and hold the power button for 15 seconds until a quick drumbeat sound . \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 2 update , August 2011 : Battery die July 2010 : my unit 's internal battery go belly up . I get this unit in November 2010 . after email TomTom they instruct I to return it to they at my cost . they then send I a new unit . deal with customer service be acceptable . not stellar , but not bad . however , find how to file a email claim be challenge on they web site . they want you to try all the faq helpful hint first . while this be understandable , I would prefer the link to customer service be more intuitive . good news ! the `` legal notice '' screen '' have disappear : when I recently connect my unit to get update , I notice the startup screen warn about liability and etc. be finally go . I find the startup `` lawyer screen '' , irritating . yes , I realize I still have to pay attention to the road ; I do not need a screen to remind I about the hazard of distract driving .
GPS	POS	4	unit do a good job with direction . on trip , time compute be way off and correct too slowly . for the price the 510 be a good purchase .
GPS	POS	4	the only thing lack in this item be something that secure the GPS unit inside of the case like a netted pocket or elastic band . otherwise it be a great value for you money & great for travel !
GPS	NEU	3	buy it new for 300 on ebay , it do work well when it work but unfortunatly , it do not always work . there would be time when it just would not turn on . never have any problem with get support from Magellan , but they do not know what to do either . slow to find signal but good in hold it and recalculate when miss exit . again , you get what you pay for and this unit be certaily not woth more then $ 300 .
GPS	NEG	2	I buy this for my boyfriend and it work okay for nearly 2 year . by that time , the unit do not hold a charge at all so it have to be continuously plug in or you would have to plug it in and restart it . also , the map get very out of date and it would have be expensive to upgrade they - I think it would be better to get a new gp , but my bf keep use it until its last die breath , which be rather painful since it seem like every time he take it on a trip with he , when he bring it back the touch screen would not work any more . this make it completely unusable , but then after a while it would decide to start work again . the calibration also get off all the time , so we would start a trip and try to punch in the information and even the security code would be near impossible to type in so it would take forever to unlock it , recalibrate and then finally put in the destination . there be no way either of we would buy a gp again without it have the lifetime map feature , but because of all the problem I be not too sure about buy anything that be a Garmin . right now he be use he iPhone to get drive direction when necessary , which come with it be own unique problem and restriction , and sometimes just he brain which be probably the best if you be at all familiar with the area you be drive but also come with it be own unique problem -lrb- haha -rrb- but definitely search for a stand-alone gp unit that will be better than this be .
GPS	POS	5	I be reluctant to pay more money , consider I see other price hundred less . I recently move to a new state , and need something short of hijack a local to get around . I like to expandability of this middle of the road model . I especially like the portability of it , that I can carry it in my pocketbook or mount it on the car . although I find turn it on take a few hard push on the button-but it still be a great device . it have prove itself especially in traffic when I hit the detour button . it be well worth the money !!!
GPS	POS	5	I purchase this for my 1490t but lose it in like a week . its a good product especially the side pocket on the side . I would just purchase another one at a local store for cheaper tho . it would save you some real $ $ $
GPS	POS	5	I be hesitant to purchase the Garmin 205 as it look bulky . I prefer the 405 , however , be hesitant to spend that amount of money when the review be not absolutely rave about it . anyway , I receive the 205 and start use it the follow day . I absolutely love it ! I do not notice the bulkiness when I be run and it be easy to move between screen . I be primarily use it for interval work and it be great . I want to customize some of the workout and have not quite get that figure out yet , but I think I just need to re-read the instruction . Money well spend and I would definitely buy it again . I be no longer think about the 405 as I be very happy with the 205 .
GPS	POS	5	hello everyone , when we first get we Prism Handspring Visor , we we be debate on if we should get the gp module or not . I be glad we do ! I have find the mapping software very detailed , and I can not wait for the Rand McNally Street Finder map software to come out . I hear that you can do point to point . I highly recommend the handygp concider the functionality and the price . there be so many different feature that you can do . I can not imagine why there have be people that have not enjoy this handy little device . I be able to name my house , my sister house , my favorite restaurant , etc. . . this be a totally cool toy on the cut edge . definetly a must have !
GPS	NEG	1	I purchase the TomTom XXL when it be a Lightning Deal , so I make the mistake of order quickly instead of take time to read all the review . I admit , I get suck in by the low price . well , you get what you pay for . the unit be deliver , the instruction say to just plug it into you computer and tomtomhome will start automatically . I plug in the usb cable and my computer recognize the GPS as a external drive , but that be it . nothing happen . I find the file and install manually , and tomtomhome start up . it immediately want to update the software and map , which be exactly why I would plug it in , so I tell it to go ahead . the software update , but I get a error say that there be not enough space for the map update . so I copy the old map to my computer -lrb- which the software be obviously design to do -rrb- and then install the new map . everything seem to be fine , except that it take literally \* hour \* to install the new map even with my high speed connection . everything seem fine , so I eject the unit , shut down the software , and turn on the unit . no map find . that be it , just a white screen that say `` no map find . '' so I plug it back in and try to find the problem HOME say my map need to be activate . okay , so I click activate and enter my promotion code . I get a little green check mark say that I have enter the correct code . I click the button , and I get a xml error . I try at least a dozen time , no luck , xml error . the error message actually say that my code be correct , but they can not activate my map . I go hunting around online for a solution and discover that this have be a ongoing issue since at least 2004 , and TomTom apparently see no reason why they should fix the problem \* or \* stop advertise that they product be Mac compatible when they clearly be not . I pack it back up in the box and print out a return authorization . my new Garmin Nuvi should be deliver tomorrow . I 'll never buy another TomTom product .
GPS	POS	4	I receive a Garmin Nuvi 350 through Amazon at a substantial savings to best buy , etc. . out of the box I be able to turn it on and use it to find a banquet I have to go to that night . I do not even have to enter the address , I just enter the name of the banquet hall and it take I right there . there be almost no learning curve and it have not let I down yet as far as accuracy . this include a recent trip to Colorado for skiing .
GPS	NEG	2	either the software information on the device be outdate or it be badly flaw as sometimes it choose route that appear go in a near circle . the alternative route would have be much shorter and logical .
GPS	POS	4	when the item work it be great . I have have problem from the first . screen go off . part of picture not there . after 2 hour it just go out . it do not like heat . if you get one without problem it work great . if you follow what it say to go you will not get lose . it do sometime go to place in some different way then I would go . Garmin have state they would fix or replace it if what they tell I to fix it do not work . I would buy again maybe . I have hear of greater problem with other that be not Garmin .
GPS	NEG	2	use rechargeable aaa battery , with the Battery Saver feature turn on , about two hour . sometimes I get more use alkaline , but not much more . honestly , this unit be worthless , because I can not trust the battery . Order a Garmin Etrex Legend instead . it be not much more expensive , larger or heavier , and it include a base map of road , town , and shoreline . the Legend come with a cable to transfer datum from you computer . the Legend 's screen be a bit larger , but show much more detail . and - the battery last hour and hour .
GPS	POS	4	I purchase this item because I want the live traffic and also the step by step direction . the step by step direction be handy in that you can review the turn and direction in order that you can determine howthe gp be navigate you . I have be very happy with this product in that it seem to be right on with traffic delay and arrival time . however , there be one major annoying feature that I absolute dislike . the GPS have advertisement that show up that you can not get rid of . I guess that be how Magellen pay for the free traffic by sell advertisement . after a while you become use to it , but I rather not have it and I wish there be a way to turn it off . another issue that I have experience be that in area of tall building once in a while , like downtown LA , the gp seem to get lose due to lost signal . but in all , I have be very happy with it and it seem very accurate .
GPS	NEG	1	the best part of the design be that it do grip my iphone\/gps very tightly . but , the adhesive base for the dash board do not stick and fall back off after 5 minute of apply it . I do prep the dash first to help the adherence but it do not help . so , I try to use the optional vent clip and as I slide it into the vent to position it the finger of the clip break off and fall down into the vent . I could suction the holder to my windshield , but I buy it to use on my dash board and it just do not cut it . very disappoint . long story short , this product be not worth the $ 8 I pay for it , so beware .
GPS	POS	4	there be many thing I like about this unit -- it be very light and compact , and I find it easy to use . I find the base map surprisingly detailed -lrb- for my area -rrb- , and upload the detailed map from MapSend fill in all the tiny road . now the downer : - mapsend need some lovin ' . I can not just pick the ... baud rate I want ; it must `` discover '' it . interestingly , certain mismatch between what it be try and what the 330 be expect make MapSend crash . just let I pick a number , ... - mapsend do not try anything past 19,200 bp . the thing -lrb- supposedly -rrb- work at 115,200 . - still wait for street map of Europe . - it will not plot a -lrb- street -rrb- course for you . not a big deal for I , but if you primary usage be in a car in place you do not know , you 'll probably want one that draw the `` right turn here '' arrow and talk to you , etc. . . since I use it on the water and for hike the 330 's behavior be just fine -lrb- it can draw a straight line from you present position to any desire locale -rrb- .
GPS	POS	5	this be my third gp and my first Magellan . it be calculate risk purchase on my part because of the way rating spread from best to worse . and after own if for few month I could see why as I have experience the best and not so best of this gp . the first hurdle be register you gp . how you go about obtain free map update be not clearly explain . there be simplify one page instruction paper include that tell what you must do to get access to you free map update . you be to download and install the free content manager software -lrb- pc only . sorry , no mac -rrb- -lrb- the website be print on the paper -rrb- . Register you product with content manager . note : important to have you pn # ready . on mine , the PN # be locate in a very small font , on the lower right corner of Lifetime Map Updates include paper . you will follow the prompt of Content Manager and register you Magellan . after that you right click the Content Manager icon -lrb- not the shortcut -rrb- and click check for Update now and if go well , the content manager software should show what latest map and firmware update you can download . if any other reviewer see error on my part then do please post correction . I find the GPS easy to use and intuitive . when I first start use it I do notice the position lag that other reviewer have post . however , the latest firmware update eliminate that issue completely . once , the GPS freeze on I . if that happen move the power button from on position to reset position and keep it there until the GPS turn off . I live in San Francisco Bay Area and unlike other reviewer I have be pretty satisfy with how it perform . one feature I be not aware of but it be there be when you hit traffic jam a icon will pop up which if you press it will give alternative direction away from the jam . I be use to GPS announce `` recalculate '' whenever I miss a turn but after a while I get use to Magellan just calculate revise direction without the announcement . I guess buy gp be almost a gamble when you think about it . you rely on other reviewer 's experience to help you make the best possible choice but you may still end up with a dud . I be very happy with this purchase .
GPS	POS	5	buy this for ourselves for Christmas . take it on trip from Virginia to unfamiliar part of Florida in late dec\/early Jan. . the 3.5-in screen be plenty large for we . gp be easy to program and mount . only problem come when we mount it on a too cold windshield , and GPS fall off . remount it after windshield have warm up . have to reset gp by turn off , then back on , but it recover like a champ . well please with we nuvi 350 .
GPS	POS	5	I purchase this case for a recently purchase Garmin nuvi 2460LMT -lrb- 5 '' -rrb- . I have purchase Garmin GPS unit in the past and each time Garmin include a protective case . not so with this one . back to Amazon to find a appropriate protective case . there be plenty to choose from but at $ 8.66 incl . tax & delivery , this be it ! fit my Garmin perfectly and just as good as the case Garmin provide in the past . highly recommend .
GPS	POS	5	this thing work great . I be a military soldier and have to run . I have always struggle with my run time for physical fitness test . now I have a virtual partner that keep I on pace and help to inprove my time by keep track of my lap , mileage , and split . get this product . you will not be disappointed !
GPS	NEG	1	I get one of these piece of junk for my birthday a year ago - I think it have work a total of once . first , the mount arm do not keep the product at a angle where it can be view . I contact TomTom and they tell I that my mount arm be not part of a recall of mount arm - so I have to buy a new one . I do - twice - neither work . I call TomTom again and they tell I that the mount arm frequently malfunction when the temperature be over 80 degree - I live in Texas - the temperature be over 80 degree 6 month of the year . next , I have to constantly restart the TomTom - it seem to not like to work for more than a couple of hour at a time . then , yesterday , I try to restart it and nothing happen so I box the whole thing up -lrb- 3 docking arm and all -rrb- and mail it back to TomTom . save you money - get a Garmin !
GPS	POS	5	this 5 '' nuvus be the best I have have so far . the standard Garmin ease of operation along with the increase size make it a perfect aid in travel and navigation . the add Traffic Update feature be very helpful miss the backup around Atlanta 2 week ago while come home from Tampa . I will not travel without it !
GPS	POS	5	very nice setup , come with ac adapter , car charger and window suction mount . if you do not follow it be direction it recaluclate almost immediately with new one . huge pre-built datum base of gas station , restaurant , hotel etc. . type in any address and it find it . come with entire US build in , so you do not need to upload map to it as you travel to new area . only negative be that it be a little hard to read in direct sunlight and like all similar product it sometimes miss a more direct route . I be very impressed with it .
GPS	POS	5	the Go 910 be definitely the best gp device out there today . I use it on a long sojourn on the East Coast over the fourth of July weekend and it never miss . before I leave I load up a bunch of playlist onto the device with plenty of room to spare !! before I leave I be concern about the mount droop in the hot weather . I do not know if people have try this , but you have to turn the dial on the mount such that it click in twice . there be a first click , then dial farther until the padlock symbol meet the dot . even in the 90-degree weather the dock do not move . voice have some trouble with street name , but still , with the text-to-speech it be nice to have something more than the generic `` turn right here . '' love the big screen , better than Nuvi 360 and the Streetpilot c550 , my next turn be always visible well in advance . phone conversation be clear and map accuracy be fine . a great product !
GPS	POS	4	this case work very well on the handlebars of my road bicycle or my mountain bike . I dont worry at all about it fall because it be so well shield in this case . the only thing that I can really find wrong with it be that when you put the NUVI in the case , you can hardly hear the voice speak to you . of course , if the voice be not that important to you , then there be no problem at all : -rrb-
GPS	POS	4	I have use my TomTom a few time since purchase it , so not a lot of experience . it be most helpful on the road , but do have some street name and address that be in error . I have issue try to get the lifetime map code to activate - it take several try with error message to get it to take . the download of the new map be very slow , until I move to a faster wifi spot , and then when it do download and install it would not work - problem at TomTom 's end . I be wait for a good 1\/2 hour on the phone for support before be help . I have find that use online support be a much better way to get tech support and question answer . the reply I receive , and step that be detail in the email , be most helpful . for the price pay , I really like the unit ... especially the idea of Lifetime Maps . hopefully the unit will lead a long life , to take advantage of those update : -rrb-
GPS	POS	5	it be very easy to use . Easy to set up . very exact with instruction . graphic and sound be just right . I highly recommend this product .
GPS	POS	4	this be my fifth gp unit . my first GPS unit be a Lowrance gm100 follow by a Garmin and a Magellan Sportrak and then a Lowrance go2 . all have be good unit . I be very inpress when I first receive the Lowrance h20 unit . I be impress by the screen size first and foremost . second , I be pleasantly suprised to find the car power adapter . shortly after purchase the unit , I buy the software package . it include the map software , a 64mb sd card and the card reader . I be very happy with the set , but I would have prefer a direct cable connection to the unit as oppose to have to use the card reader to transfer datum . the software be also somewhat limit in feature as well . I would like to see more feature involve trail . the map be great and very accurate . transfer datum work great but be somewhat difficult in that you must remove the card which require removal of the battery . I would give the unit five star if it be not for the above limitation . if you just look at the unit itself base on accuracy and useability , it definitely rank five star .
GPS	NEU	3	the item be ok but I hate the fact that I be get pop-up advertisement when it come on . it also have some mis information in it as do my old one which sometimes lead I into never never land .
GPS	NEG	1	this do not charge you Garmin . it only provide power to the GPS . DO NOT buy this if you be expect it to charge you battery in you gp . my battery steadily lose power as it be plug into this device . the seller be great though and refund my money without I even ask and obviously mistake can happen . just make sure you device charge if that be what you be look to buy .
GPS	POS	4	my first unit have a defective radio and Garmin swap it out and save my waypoint . suggest you buy ear bud w \/ PTT mic . my hunting party use they and it coordinate we hunt accurately especially send waypoint . bring battery since 6hr seem to be useable time . if money be not a issue buy 530 model since the radio power be 5 watt versus 1\/2 watt and the togel switch be easier to use . overall it make hunting with a group better .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin nuvus 350 be a great gp for the money . it be very easy to use and have great feature . we buy it to give to we oldest son as he be leave for college , which give we peace of mind as parent . I highly recommend it . Dan -lrb- Kansas City , MO -rrb-
GPS	NEG	2	bottom warped and constantly slide off dash . Poor product . I would not recomend it . Navgear have a better dash mopunt .
GPS	NEG	1	not a item to be use with a pc for the tracking download . have to remove Garmin software from pc , it keep lock my pc down !
GPS	NEG	1	great idea and form factor let down by miserable online experience , weak user interface and poor service feature . specifically , as note by other reviewer , Garmin 's online service be more frequently down than available - consequently the ability to track you precious item\/pet be meaningless as you be unable to query the system more than , by my estimate , 20 % of the time -lrb- I have be flagging this to Garmin for the past 5 day but who , for the time be , deny that there be any issue with they service availability -rrb- . the track history be only available for 24 hour unless you buy a higher-level package - combine this with the fact that you can not actually access the history for more than a fraction of when you need , you might as well not bother . there be multiple other gp tracking system -lrb- eg the spot  SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger unit  and quality -lrb- better gp recognition and reporting -rrb- . I will be return my Garmin GTU 10 to the shop at the weekend as I have simply have enough of waste my time try to get Garmin to recognize they be disappointing customer .
GPS	NEG	1	my holder break after use for a month . it have a design problem . there be a very strong spring inside the holder ' four screw be place in each side of the holder to place two plastic part together . there be nothing to support the two plastic part together in the middle where they place the spring at . what happen to my holder be that the plastic deform due to the strong tension inside . I be very disappointed at this product , since I be plane to drive one of my friend to the airport that day .
GPS	POS	5	I have have the product for a couple of month . this product be great and do everything advertise . all function appear to be quite accurate . yes it be not fashionable , but its a fair tradeoff for the map and compass function that come in really handy when hike . everything be very intuative . the only complaint I have about the product be the 1 + min startup time require to locate the GPS satellite .
GPS	POS	4	. . as should be obvious , know exactly where you be be equally as important as know exactly where you need to be . as a Sonet Technician , I purchase this unit to help find communication site in obscure , often desolate area of the eastern US . in the past , I have to rely upon either someone whom have never actually be there and use a web-based mapping site to issue turn-by-turn direction , or people recall the location from memory , `` I think you turn at  , then look for the concrete cow on the left which mean you just pass the turn so go back and turn right . '' neither be very accurate , so I begin use my laptop and try out a number of mapping program . I settle on m 's Streets & Trips 2000 due to the ease with which I could open a window of save point , double click on the one I need and find they automatically enter as waypoint -lrb- a feature inexplicably remove from subsequent release -rrb- . use a mapping program alone work fairly well , but the flaw be that once I miss a turn -- most often in the dead of night -- I have to determine where I be in order to find my way back to the plot course . terribly frustrating and confusing to be look for route 773 and be surround by route 377 , 737 , 337 , etc. . . this be a perfect application of a GPS unit as it can save literally dozen of hour per year of time lose to backtrack .  my decision to purchase the Magellan brand come of a friend 's recommendation of a map 330 and of distil fact from diatribe on number of gps-related bbss . instead of explore the merit -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- of one mfgr \ model over another , these discussion typically degenerate into little more than flame war . anyway ... I purchase a Magellan Meridian platinum at the local CompUSA for considerably more than I would have pay have I order it from Amazon . CompUSA stock neither the vehicle mount bracket nor the data\/power cable accessory on the day i purchase the unit .  when I first power up the unit , I be indoors and quite disappointed that I get no satellite lock whatsoever . however , it quickly find my location once I step outside and have a unobstructed view of the sky . I discover that the unit work less than perfectly unless hold vertically and that even a single finger place over the antenna section substantially degrade reception . I enter into m Streets & Trips 2002 -lrb- st2k2 -rrb- the lat-long location datum for the 14 site we need to visit between Atlanta and Jax , fl . use the include datum cable , I connect the Meridian platinum to the laptop , then run the GPS setup . I be on the road in minute . find the site be a piece of cake for the most part , though it do take a while to get use to the update lag time . st2k2 's help file explain that the software poll the GPS only every 15 seconds , mathematically account for what I find to be a average of nearly 1\/3 mile error in position . from then on , I have the driver slow down 1\/2 mile before each turn . when we do miss turn thereafter , it be only because st2k2 's map be not entirely accurate -lrb- particularly around Athens , GA -rrb- .  i find myself constantly check the battery power display and wish I have the data\/power cable . be forwarn that the Meridian platinum eat battery for lunch . I burn four per day -lrb- two set -rrb- over a four day period , average only slightly more than a halflife of what the documentation state ; I get no more than about eight hour from a fresh set of high quality alkaline . certainly the ability to turn off the unit 's display would dramatically increase battery life . I find no reference to do such in the . pdf manual . this be a oversight in my opinion , but undoubtedly can be correct in a software update from Magellan .  because the mount bracket be not available at the time I make my purchase , I have to leave the Meridian on the dashboard . from this arise a number of problem . the gp be occasionally power down when bump in rough backroad cause it to bounce around and depress the power button . also , it frequently lose satellite lock due in part to such jostle , but more to the fact that it be impossible to have a unobstructed view of the sky inside the cab of a large truck and that it can not be hold vertically without the mount bracket . another consequence of be on the dash be that the unit become \* extremely \* hot when expose to direct sunlight . so hot , in fact , I become concerned that such tremendous heat might be damaging . while it seem no less the worse for wear , I would rather it not get that hot in the first place . I believe the simplest solution to these problem be not a mount bracket , but a external antenna -- the expensive unit can then sit safely tuck out of harm 's way . unfortunately , the Meridian line do not provide for the direct connection of a external antenna , and this alone might be reason enough to warrant a return for refund . I find it tremendously annoy that the designer would disallow such a option .  i buy a unit much more capable than I actually need or will ever use , so my advice to those new to gpss be that you take you time and fully investigate the function you need , carefully research the function that several different vendor and they unit provide , then , once you have decide on what you want , stop and research a little more . if at all possible , borrow a friend 's or rent a number of different model for a few day . I can not knock the Meridian platinum because it have more feature than I 'll ever use , and I be certain backpacker and geocacher will love this thing , but the lack of a external antenna port must be take into account . this can not be overstate : if the primary use of you gp receiver will be inside a vehicle , look for something else .  i award the Magellan Meridian platinum 4 of 5 star .  pro : Works well , seem quite rugged , have numerous cool feature , and will give owner obvious brag rights . con : lack external antenna capability , a bit spendy , and eat battery like M&M; s.
GPS	POS	4	I finally replace my old heart rate monitor with this gp device . I like it a lot as it show I the vitals that I need to keep on push further . I have not explore all the feature but I be happy with the basic that it provide I so far .
GPS	POS	5	the Garmin nuvi 1450 GPS work great . the direction be clear and easy to follow . we use the index of attraction while on vacation and the unit be easy to program and very user friendly . the screen be large enough to see the map .  Garmin nuvi 1450 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator
GPS	POS	5	great product ! instruction leave a lot to be desire for novice computer people . very unclear instruction about download datum to computer and which program be best to use . . vague at best and inadequate at worst . thanks gary Johnson
GPS	POS	4	you can not tell this be not a brand new unit . it even have the warranty . it keep a lock even in deep wood . the map be a big help but would not be necessary if people would give parking co-ordinate ! my only complaint about this unit be that the sp card fall out when I change battery .
GPS	POS	5	I have be with Garmin since my first gp . I have the Garmin Nuvi 265T and it work well for I until the map have expire and I have to pay to purchase a map . I figure if I purchase the map , my total for what I pay for the gp plus the map will be equal to buy a newer gp . my friend let I use she Garmin 765T and it be wonderful . I have always believe that the Garmin system be very user-friendly , and it be the reason why I do not want to switch manufacturer . however , whenever I look at the newer model , it seem that I have to pay more for a new Garmin unit which have less feature than what other manufacturer brand be offer . I look around and the TomTom XXL 540tm really take my interest . I keep on look around and read all the review here and it seem like it be easier for I to accept its con than what I have read in other GPS unit . I wait for black Friday Sale to get a unit . I check Amazon 's price and think that be the best deal , but I see that Staples be offer the unit at the same price on black Friday so I decide to get it from Staples . I pay extra for sale tax but I be able to get the unit right away as compare with wait for 5-8 business day before delivery from Amazon -lrb- no , I be no longer a prime member -rrb- . pro : 1 . I like the wide screen . I have own the Nuvi 265T forever and it be a small screen compare to what I have with TomTom XXL . 2 . the lifetime map be very much appreciate . at least I know that I 'll never have to worry about my map be outdate . 3 . the traffic update be very helpful . I be drive home from NJ to md and it take I away from all the road congestion of people come home after Thanksgiving break and all the toll road be congest . the garmin I use have traffic feature in they but I have never experience anything helpful with it as what I have with my new TomTom . : -rrb- 4 . I like how it show I the total time and the total distance . I drive to NJ every weekend and I get impatient look at the Garmin GPS that I use because it would show I the number of mile I need to drive to reach a certain point on my trip and then when I finish drive those mile , I get another set of mile and it just feel endless . for a 3-hour -lrb- or more -rrb- every weekend , it can make I very impatient not know how much progress I be make with my drive . my new TomTom show I the total time and distance I need to drive , plus the number of mile I would be drive to reach segment of my trip . 5 . the TomTom XXL 540tm have a drive break suggestion ! awesome ! 6 . I like the audio quality better than the GPS unit I have use before . 7 . TomTom HOME be very user-friendly and make the GPS very easy to customize . con : 1 . I be use to the ease of mount of the Garmins . I own a Garmin friction mount so I never worry about mount the Garmin on the windshield . even so , it be never difficult to mount the garmin on the windshield . they be always easy to mount and to remove . I have a different luck with the TomTom . I have to get help mount it on the windshield because I be have difficulty turn the thing to make the suction thing stick to the windshield . then I have to keep it on the windshield once we be able to make it stick because I find it difficult to have to put it back there and remove it whenever I be not use the gp . then there be the challenge of put the GPS unit itself on the mount everytime I need to use it . it never take I less than thrice to make it stay mount on the mount . 2 . the traffic update only work when the unit be plug in to the charger . for some reason , I wish it work even when not plug in because it be always better to work with a gp wireless , right ? : -rrb- 3 . it do not really bother I , but for the benefit of other , this do not have bluetooth and expandable memory card slot . so far I have not encounter problem with not have enough space on the unit to update my map since I get it . so far , these be what I have observe . I be glad I decide to get a TomTom instead of another Garmin . I love all the feature and I definitely recommend it . : -rrb-
GPS	POS	4	Thought about purchase a gp system for quite awhile but could not decide which one . daughter and she husband recommend a Garmin and after look they over and read other review decide this be what we need to have in the vehicle my husband use for business and then I use it to find a store . now we discuss who get to use it !
GPS	POS	4	we really like this other than we find out we can not enter in exact coordinate which have turn out to be a problem . you can get coordinate for almost every place but we can not enter they in on this device which be a problem live here in Germany when you want to go to Spain or France etc. . I can get the coordinate to site we want to visit on google but it be not so easy to get a address and even when you do they very so much by country it be hard to get to the location .
Projector	POS	5	I have to admit , that this be not the easiest equipment to put together , but that be mainly because it have to be versitile . all projector mount situation be not the same , so I can understand why the manufacturer do not supply specific instruction . if you be handy , or have someone around that be , I would highly suggest this . if you have trouble with assemble Ikea furniture , I would look elsewhere . in my situation , I have a drop ceiling with you typical cross beam above . this work out great , and I have be able to cut a 2 '' hole in the ceiling tile , and adjust the mount 's extention arm to the perfect height . this way I be not worry about duck under a projector constantly . White be a good match , as it would be for most ceiling . overall construction be sturdy , and not much movement once everything be tighten down . I would have a set of hex wrench ready , because although they provide you with one , it be necissary to have one on each side when really tighen . about 30-40 minute assembly time .
Projector	POS	5	I like product that be as simple as possible and require very little set up time . I be able to get this up and run with my computer within 3 minute without even look at the user guide . when I start stream a movie from Netflix , the picture be a crisp 70 '' movie-theater quality picture -lrb- really crisp when I turn off the light -rrb- . I be really glad I buy this instead of a lcd screen . the basics : - come with a VGA connector for you computer - you do not need to buy it separately - it be incredibly light at 5 lb - very portable - the cord to connect it to the power supply be pretty short -lrb- estimate at 3-5 foot -rrb- , so you might need a extension cord depend on where you put it in you room - no speaker - you 'll need separate speaker . I just buy Sony gaming speaker to connect via usb to my computer for a full home theater experience
Projector	NEG	1	UNFORTUNALLY I have to SAY that this item be the worst thing I have VER BOUGHT in MY LIFE , I do weekly presentation at work & GUESS what , I almost lost my job over this item , it work fine a COUPLE of TIMES & THEN IT just stop it just would ` nt do anything . please DONT BUY UNLESS you know HOW to fix it ... SORRY
Projector	POS	5	as long as you be not work in a big theater , this be a terrific projector for everyday presentation . it be one of the least expensive on the market , and easy to use right out of the box . the control be super-easy and the hook up simple and clear . a nice sharp , bright image in a very small and lightweight package .
Projector	POS	5	I be a little skeptical of 5 star review , but this mount most certainly deserve that ! I recently purchase a Planar Pd7060 , and be in need of a mount with good adjustment , due to my low drop ceiling in my theater\/basement . -lrb- the Planar do not have a lens shift ... -rrb- as mention in earlier review , the instruction be lack , but the build quality of this thing more than make up for the shortfall of the literature . I have to make a brace behind the ceiling tile outof 2x 's and that probably take longer to do than install the projector . I be very pleased with all the tilt , yaw , forward , back , and side to side adjustment that can be make . it be very easy to square the projector to the wall or screen you be project on ... it have a variety of bolt include for mount you projector , I do not need to go to Lowe 's or hd to pick up any thing ... my Planar have three mount point , and the mount have 2 set of 3 adjustable arm , that I be sure will work with almost any projector . W there be set screw in every adjustable pivot point to lock you setting in place . this thing will not move ! pricepoint and versatility be top notch ! I order the black version , but this be the same model .
Projector	POS	5	i be use this projector in a linux -lrb- ubuntu -rrb- system . the quality of the image be perfect ... it be easy to set up -lrb- in fact , there be not necesary to do anything at all , just to plug it on -rrb- . the image size be always the same , it just depend of the projection distance . but the image resolution depend of the connection wire -lrb- if a s-video the max resolution be 800x600 , if VGA the resolution grow up to 1920x1200 ... -rrb- and the graphic card . i be project the movie to a white wall , and have a image size about 1.80 m diag with 3m distance between wall and projector . it be not necessary to turn off all the ligth because the high contrast ratio , but it be better if there be not a lot clarity in the room .
Projector	POS	5	Have have this for 10 month and it have perform flawlessly . even have a few power outage that shut it down unexpectedly and it still work great . on a 135 '' screen and seat 12 foot away , the picture be great . maybe 1080p would be better but most of what I watch be not 1080p and for the price and lamp life , you can not beat it . more hdmi input would be nice but you can always buy a hdmus switch . I only watch it on eco mode and the picture be great -lrb- window be completely black out and only ambient hall lighting from downstairs -rrb- . even with light on , it do not totally wash out the screen . I be very pleased with this projector and it should last I a while until 1080p projector with longer lasting light source come along -lrb- at a reasonable price -rrb- . do not know about 3d because I be a cheapskate that will not pay $ 100 for glass .
Projector	POS	5	this be a winner . Works very well , color be good , and adjustable , frame alignment for key ning be good , quite a package for the price !
Projector	POS	5	I use the Vantage Point cgupm12-s to mount a Panasonic pt-ae200u projector . the mount be easy to put together and install , work great , very adjustable , well make , look good . I would highly recommend this product . I call Vantage Point to make sure the mount would work with my projector , they return my call and be very helpful .
Projector	NEU	3	although it do the job represent , the camlock to hold the screen in position be very flimsy and during the second use I have to shore it up to prevent the screen from fall down .
Projector	POS	5	I be very happy with this purchase . the projector screen be truly excellent . I like the fact that it come with two remote control . I also like that the you can stop the screen at any height you want . the motor be very quiet and you can hardly hear it . the screen really make the color of my Epson 8350 Home Cinema 1080p projector really come alive a show its 1080p capability . I make my family room a home theater and it really look amazing . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that want a high quality electric projector screen . buy it and you will know exactly what I mean . excellent price and excellent quality . the Favi hd-150 projector be under-priced .
Projector	NEG	2	I love the size but , picture quality be lack and I buy mine so my wife could use it at school in a room with the light off . I guess there be still too much light because it be impossible to see . I should have save my money . great concept just not bright enough
Projector	POS	5	this be my first projector . all I can say be wow . I use this projector for everything . it be my computer monitor and my tv . I go from a 28 '' lcd computer monitor that I be happy with to this projector which I be thrill with . there be nothing like play a game and fight a 6 ' troll that be actually 6 ' on the screen ! my big concern with buy a projector be clarity and screen refresh rate . dvd , blu-ray , Netflix all show clear and beautiful . fp and online rpg like WOW and eq2 be all clear and smooth . there be no bluring , artifact , or lag from this projector . the bad ... black level . they be not terrible but at some time the dark or black area be a little wash out . this be in a totally dark room . it be also be project on super-white photo paper -lrb- diy screen -rrb- . for the lower cost of this projector and the longer bulb life I can easily live with this . also , text be sometimes a little blury . not a lot , just a tiny pinch . but it may not be the projector . clean the lens with proper lens cleaner clear some of it and I may need to look into a new screen or tighten my current one -lrb- it seem to be a bit difficult to get the DIY paper screen perfectly sag and wrinkle free -rrb- over all I love this projector . UPDATE : after 1044 hour on the bulb -lrb- 9 month -rrb- it go dim for a day then go out with a pop . Epson be easy to contact . I send they a email . the next day they send I a email ask specific question , one of which be my address . two day later I have a new bulb . Free of hastle , Free of charge .
Projector	NEG	1	this projector do not work properly and the vendor do not respond to inquiry . the product do not come with complete warranty information or address for service . there be no contact information for the manufacturer . you be better off with a name brand and\/or local vendor .
Projector	POS	5	I purchase this projector because of its size , I can easily carry it with I from home , classroom , and meeting . it fit in my purse and along with a netbook make for a very versatile , easy to carry system . the image be bright clear and easy to see , and the speaker be very good . we child hook they computer up and view the screen on the living room and they bedroom wall . it be easy to move around ~ one of the girl use it with she rocket team in the backseat of the van so all team member could see and discuss the computer output , and need change for the next qualify launch . it can be use everywhere , even outside to watch show on the front porch . the price make it most affordable . I have be delighted to have it .
Projector	POS	5	I buy this for my husband for Christmas . nice general alarm clock with a few extra . the large display on the ceiling be awesome ! no need to crank neck around pillow in the middle of the night . the nature sound be ok . the time be pre-set , so all that be involve be plug it in . it have a flashlight as well , but we have not use it yet . overall it be a nice alarm clock .
Projector	NEG	2	so , I do a ton of research before make this purchase , and I be still blind-sided by poor design choice across the board on the pk301 . First of all , I be mac base , so in order to convert my video file -lrb- why do this not offer the ability to play back more codec ? -rrb- I have to load up handbrake . after several hour of completely waste time convert video to the claim acceptable codec and fail to have any of they work on the projector , I sit down and begin to search for a answer online -lrb- the proper info on how to handle the video file convert for mac user be not include in the manuel -rrb- I manage to figure out the very strict guideline for the file conversion process . I begin convert a few video to test the projector and put they on a 4gig microsd card . the first video I transfer be a 22 minute tv show . the file size come to be around 540mb . it do not work . I spend another half day struggle with this until I try change the file 's extension from . m4v to . mp4 . miraculously , once I do that , it play fine . would have be good to know this a day earlier . seriously ? seriously ? ok . so after all that , I finally have the proper -lrb- and somewhat tedious -rrb- direction on how to get these file prep to work on this thing . boy , let I tell you , you better not be the spontaneous type , because the the time it take to prep a video file for this thing be enough to kill the spirit of any group hope to watch a video outside on the fly . second major problem be the battery life . now , EVERY single write up I find online mention some fabled `` extended 5 hour battery '' for this thing . where ? where be it ? I 'll pay for it ! I have the money . 200 dollar ? fine ! fine ! where the hell be it ?! it do not exist . that be all there be to it . it be not real . do not buy this thing because of that `` 5 hour battery '' you have read about on every single tech blog that mention this projector , because it do NOT EXIST . so , as a alternative , there be third party adapter that do not come package with the proper cable to be use with the pk301 , so who need that ? yet another ridiculous brick wall separate I from really enjoy this projector . sure , you can find a extra batter -lrb- the exact same one that come with the projector -rrb- for 30 buck ... but where the hell be the 5 hour ? where ? where be IT?@!!!@!!!!! the next problem be the internal firmware . come on guy . Update please . and post the update on you website and make it easy to find and implement on both MAC and PC . this be just ridiculous . if one of my movie file be bigger than 2gigs it will not show up as a valid file ? be you serious ? why ? so I have to go through the messy process of trial and error in order to break my movie file up into multiple smaller file on order to use they on this projector ? this be absolutely unnecessary ! get in there and overhaul the firmware of this thing and update it ! make it better ! add more codec ! allow for the recognition of larger file ! release the extended battery ! what the hell be the matter with this company ? it could be so easy to dominate the pico projector market with these simple product adjustment and additional support . the other problem here be the provide cable . if you want to use you iphone or ipad , you 'll need to dig around and figure out what sort of adapter and nonsense you 'll need . I have not bother yet , but I be sure it will probably set I back another couple of hundred buck and about 4 daisy chained cable before I have thing set up . from what I have read online you 'll get you Iphone or Ipad connect , but the slightest movement could result in the cable lose they connection . you 'll have to jiggle they in order to get it back up . wonderful . why not one cable ? directly from the Iphone\/Ipad , right into the projector via usb or mini hdmus ? do this exist ? well , if it do , I be sorry I do not spend the better part of my week painstakingly search the deepest part of the internet in order to find it . I guess it be my fault . I 'll get right on that . let I free up my schedule for the rest of the month so I can devote every wake moment to comb the endless span of the internet in order to find this nonexistent direct connection ipad\/iphone adapter and `` 5 hour '' extend battery . to be completely honest , I would not be this upset if this product be not so so close to be incredible . I have thousand of movie and tv show save as AVI , DIVX , etc. . I be ready and willing to spend more money on a -lrb- good -rrb- extend battery . I would spend money on a simple Iphone \/ Ipad adapter . come ON .
Projector	POS	5	I read a lot about how the packaging on the product do not provide adequate protection for the projector screen during shipping . the company must have read those because the packaging might have be able to stop a bullet . the item arrive in perfect condition even with some dent on the box from shipping . the screen itself have no wrinkle or crease . go up and down very easily and I pair it with a optoma hd20 at a throw distance of just over 15 ' and it look awesome . I could not be more excite with my home theater . I highly recommend this screen . it really stack up compare to much more expensive fix frame screen .
Projector	POS	5	this amazing little piece of technology have blow my mind . I turn my empty bedroom wall into a 50 '' screen . I have show family member travel photo at a moment notice . I have impress a few young woman at the bar . quite simply , you have the ability to project a screen of vary size anywhere - it be quite the feat and really quite fun as you watch other `` ooh and ahh '' at this technology . enjoy !
Projector	POS	4	this projector be definitely the one you want if you be look for one that be affordable , light and convenient . I be a teacher and I love this because it be so easy to set up and use and the display be clear and just like that of those other big and bulky projector . I can actually carry this one in my bag without any hassle . it be compact , and do not need to rear up , do not overheat ... I just can not say enough . . I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! the only reason why I give it 4 star be because of the tripod stand ... due to the imbalance weight , set off by the cord on one side . . the tripod keep fall . so I simply just do not use it and prop it up on book instead . my son first birthday be come up and I intend to use it to project picture at he party . it be so small and light weight ... they would not even know it be there . -lrb- smiley face -rrb- do I say I love this projector !!! well I do ! definitely a good buy for half the price !!
Projector	POS	5	5 minute out of box and watch a movie . the video quality be really good for how much we pay for it . it be project onto a paint wall and look better than many other projectors\/tvs I have see recently . at about 16 foot from the wall the picture be huge , maybe equally 16 foot . have the sound go through another receiver and speaker set up make it feel like be in a theater . my wife 's friend see it and think she would get one too . really happy with the purchase so far .
Projector	NEG	1	I be so excited to get this projector , but I be on my second one thus far , and needless to say , I be not happy at all . the first qumus I receive work great ... for one day . after that , it do not matter what device I plug into it -lrb- blurry player , iPad , iPhone , xbox -rrb- , or in what order I plug the device in , or in what order I turn on the devices\/qumi , or which hdmi cable I use to do it -lrb- I purchase several and try they on to no avail -rrb- , I repeatedly and consistenly receive the `` no source found '' message . needless to say , I be not pleased , so I send the unit back and request a replacement from Amazon -lrb- who have be nothing but great throughout this horrific process btw -rrb- . Guess what , I receive the replacement in record time . Guess what , same hdmus handshake issue . these unit be either not build well or Vivitek 's quality control be abysmal . bad customer service as well . there be get to be something better out there . very dissapointed .
Projector	POS	5	the only negative thing I can say it be for the bolt hole configuration for the ceiling support if you use a generic product . that be a great product for this price !
Projector	NEG	1	get the lamp , unpack it then put it into my sharp xr-10x projector and turn it on . wait for a couple of minute but the lamp never illuminate . the Projector say the lamp have a lamp circuit failure or be burn out , even though it be brand new ... either way it just do not work at all
Projector	POS	5	this be a good travel projector . it work well in medium to low lite . you have to buy a extra adapter to connect you ipod . the battery only last about a hour .
Projector	POS	5	just get my Electric Favi Screen 120 '' -lrb- hd-120 -rrb- , all i can say be perfect , im satisfied with the quality of the screen , the place on where i order it -lrb- Ace Photo Digital , 3rd seller party at amazon -rrb- they didnt use ups\/fedex to deliver the item but use this company call `` Home Direct '' and all i can say be awesome customer service , they be call I everytime to update the status of the item , the box be perfect and the delivery guy really handle the item with care . overall im satisfy . note : if you install this thing on a drywall ceiling like i do , i recommend use this anchor  Red Head EZPPL100 E-Z Self-Drilling Plastic Drywall Anchor -lrb- 100 per Box -rrb-  this be Screen be great with Epson 8350 on a 12 foot throw .
Projector	POS	5	so far , so good ... work just fine , and everything be as promise !! thank you . great value in a very timely fashion !!
Projector	POS	5	have this screen for about 5 month now . awesome product . everyone be surprise about how economical this screen be , but same quality as the expensive one , and more low profile than a lot of the competitor .
Projector	NEG	1	this projector be not worth you time , put you 80 $ towards a better machine . the bulb blow after six to eight movie worth of use , the fan be quite loud , and the color be off . the resolution be so low that video game text be unreadable and detail be blurry . we have try various image size and distance from the wall , it simply have too low of a resolution to display text or detail appropriately . there be no keystone setting , so the projector must be place in a straight line , directly across from the wall , and the plug be very short , so projector placement be a issue . I would not put this in a child 's room either , as the bulb blow if the unit be knock , and the unit produce a lot of heat . you would be better off spend a few dollar more and get a projector that will not require constant bulb replacement and provide a sharper picture .
Projector	POS	5	I just love this projector ! use it for Movie Night under the Stars ! Easy set up ! it be a great product for the price .
Projector	POS	5	great product , especially for the money . come with every piece you could possibly need . the seller be exceptionally great . I receive the product before the estimate arrival .
Projector	POS	4	the potential for this little projector be fantastic . but along with other reviewer , I feel that the technology be not quite on par yet to demand the price . what would be useful be a plug and play device that would allow a travel business person to easily -lrb- note the word : easily -rrb- queue up presentation on a laptop , etc for view in a board room , etc. . when I see this little projector , that be my first thought . I use a  Apple MacBook pro MC700LL\/A 13.3-Inch laptop  after search on the web , I find more information on the 3M site regard this little machine . unless you be desire to watch certain type of media -lrb- movie , ppt presentation or video -rrb- , I could not get the device to work . what about the simple concept of projection ? project my screen up onto a larger screen -lrb- if use a laptop -rrb- . I could not successfully accomplish this . perhaps a later iteration of the product will be more flexible , provide more instruction and fewer cable and confusion . the projector be not short on anything except instruction on how to use it . it be not as plug and Play as one would think . the ONLY real thing I do with it be watch a movie from my ipad use a include cable . not very useful since there be not enough sound capability to even count . this little projector be probably just at the beginning of it be type . I have confidence that in the future new iteration will be better and more intuitive . 3 star .
Projector	POS	4	I actually have work with EPSON unit with similar specification to the vs315w with regard to input and output , and find this a very comfortable personal fit . if I be to gauge the market for this I would push it toward people who be not early adopter and probably be use 3 or 4 year old computer , dvd player -lrb- heck , even VHS player -rrb- , and do not depend upon high quality sound . people with older equipment -lrb- I -rrb- will like this projector most . VGA video input and display be excellent . rca cable audio\/video input be excellent video , audio not so awesome . usb audio\/video input work , but be overall inferior . hdmus input ? not a issue for I . if you need it , do not get this box . the sound quality through the projector be mediocre which should not be a surprise for any projector of this class . the video be not for cinephile , but if you do not push the projection distance or the room lighting , the video quality can be excellent . set up for optimal distance and lighting be something that be almost only resolve in the specific environment where the equipment be use . my requirement be old school - primarily be able to use VGA to VGA for video input , or to use rca cable for audio\/video input -lrb- primarily video -rrb- . about the only time I would use the build in sound be when I be test something , or in a emergency when I do not have time to set up as I wish . the vs315w 's speaker be serviceable , but in the same way that a lot of laptop and tablet speaker be serviceable . best use in intimate setting , you will hear the sound , you will not be impress . even though it be market for its portability and easy set up and play , this be not my first choice as a stand alone . my one test with the usb input be quite unimpressive . the driver install on laptop easily , and it hook up easily . static video display -lrb- slide -rrb- be fine , but motion can be `` iffy . '' sound be actually similar to the other hookup , but with such crummy video I be not sure that matter . I also set up this unit in these two way : 1 -rrb- hook up video with VGA to VGA cable to 4 year old Dell Inspiron laptop . screen be about 20 foot from projector in a `` medium '' light room . for sound in this scenario I just run a small sound out patch cable from the Inspiron into a separate boombox and use that for my portable speaker . I have find very few projector have any decent sound . you would be surprised how use a portable sound system with nice speaker can enhance the video experience . anyway , follow by a little tweaking use the vs315w 's pretty standard menu system , and rely on the excellent automatic anti-keystoning feature -lrb- plus I love the manual keystone control button located conveniently on top of unit -rrb- I have a excellent 1280 x 800 wxga image project in a couple of minute . I run some dvd video through my pc and notice some jaggedness and some color problem - the fancier the video -lrb- e.g. , Transformers -rrb- the worse the performance . animated film come across beautifully , but they do have simpler color pallet and less demand on motion . the one powerpoint presentation I use have no true video , but quite a few animation which display to perfection . 2 -rrb- hook up video and audio with rca cable from my $ 20 Memorex dvd player . Video and sound be almost exactly as above . again , I prefer external speaker so I detach the white\/red rca sound connection and run the dvd player 's sound through my boombox again . obviously , none of this be the portability be market -lrb- carry around a dvd player or laptop , with extra boombox and this projector -rrb- . I give this four out of five star because it do what it say it do it within the publish specification . one star be knock off because the one fairly unique feature , the usb plug and play , do not seem to be ready for prime time yet . I 'll personally be use this primarily for in-office presentation in the configuration describe above .
Projector	POS	5	this be a total awesome projector ! I believe it be one of the better one for it be price & the picture be totally awesome for the size it can project . definately get what you pay for , so do not be fool into buy less expensive projector that will disappoint , when this will satisfy you home Theater craving . sure if you can afford higher Lumens , contrast , & \/ or resolution . this be a great starter projector until the more expensive price start drop more & all plazma & other become more affordable .
Projector	POS	4	the product arrive as promise on time and pack well . install lamp into projector and do have a burning odor when it start up , but seem to be work fine and odor go away . we will see if it last ! if it do it be a great price !
Projector	NEG	1	8\/16\/11 : I have now enter the 21st century with this alarm clock ! it have so many wonderful feature ! first , the number be nice and large , so it be easy for this Baby Boomer to read ! it also have a projection feature that project the time on the ceiling ! so I do not have to look at the clock to see what time it be , just take a look at the ceiling ! second , it have a automatic time zone feature . in program mode , select the number that correspond to you time zone and voilum ! it automatically set it for the time and date ! Third , it have two separate alarm . depend on the type of wake-up call you want , you can set alarm 1 for a gentle wake-up call -lrb- soothing sound for example or easy listening -rrb- and alarm 2 for those urgent , immediate wake-up call on the day you have to get to work asap . and you have you choice of soothing sound : bird chirp & chime , ocean wave , etc. . you can program the alarm to set off 7 day a week , Mondays-Fridays only , or weekend only . that be a great feature so you do not get wake up to you favorite Heavy Metal station on the weekend ! it have a backup battery system that will still wake you up even if you have a power outage during the night . my favorite feature be the `` Sleep '' feature , in which you can set the clock to play soothing sound for 60 - 99 minute . this help to put I and my little pre-school son to sleep . it shut off after the alloted time . the instruction be easy to read and follow , although you do have to read they to figure out the feature . 8\/19\/11 UPDATE : I have be force to lower my rating from 5 star to 3 . I guess that be why this clock be only $ 29.99 . after about 3 day , it start to do some wonky thing . I be use the `` Sleep '' feature to play the soothing sound mode and that have stop work . when I press it , the display alternately flash the time and a radio station . I keep have to play with it until I can at least get the soothing sound to play . it have a very long , thin wire antenna which could easily break off , so that be not so great . alarm 1 seem not to work all the time . I keep refer to the instruction to reset the `` Sleep '' feature and alarm 1 , and I do everything step by step , yet the `` Sleep '' feature do not work and alarm 1 be iffy . the instruction be not very good when you be try to troubleshoot . too bad , because the feature be really nice on the clock ... if only they would keep work . 9\/2\/11 UPDATE : Radio no longer work . soothing sound do not work . Sleep mode do not work . I set alarm 1 for 6:45 AM and it somehow switch on its own to 6:45 pm . drop rating to 1 star . I have have the clock for almost a month , and it seem more of its feature stop work . I do not recommend this clock . the basic clock still keep time , and the projection light work , but that be about it . 9\/15\/11 UPDATE : alarm do not work at all . the only thing this clock do be keep time . the light that reflect the time on the ceiling still work , but all the other feature do not . I have never have a product go bad so quickly . 9\/20\/11 : clock be DEAD . have to unplug it while clean . when I plug it back in , nothing display . never have I have a product that die so quickly as this one . save you money and buy another brand . do not buy this clock . Timex be know for watch , but not alarm clock . total disappointment .
Projector	POS	4	we have review the Optoma pk-201 pico projector on Picopros . it have virtually all the connectivity you would need and produce a sharp , bright image . see the full review as well as many other here : -lrb- ... -rrb- Paul Picopros.com
Projector	POS	5	we have only have this for a month now . we get it as a replacement . it have a great picture . a lot brighter than we last projector .
Projector	POS	5	this be the first projector I have purchase and I be very happy with it ... especially for only $ 200 . great value , I be very satisfied : -rrb-
Projector	POS	5	just like everyone else i do my own research for week . be debate on a 1080p device or 3d ready device with 720p . come down to this sucker and i aint look back ! personally i like be amaze and on top of be amaze i like save money = -rrb- . that be say this be the perfect projector for I to get because i of course take advantage of its 3d processor ! i buy the viewsonic vp3d1 converter and it work great ! i first test it out with my xbox 360 but have some trouble at 1st because my output setting be at 1080p and this device -lrb- viewsonic vp3dus -rrb- only read 1080us . once i switch the setting to 1080i the projector also allow the 3d option to turn on . as far as the quality of this projector its brilliant ! good for day and night setting . color be awesome and quality be good as well . use through hdmus port which native be 720p 20mhz but with the viewsonic converter it automatically convert it to 1080i 60mhz . only when its actual 3d content will it then display it at 720p 120mhz . as far as the glass i buy the optoma dlp lnk hz1 . my testing be still not complete as i still have to get a blue ray 3d player . im very impressed and satisfied with my curent set up . in all great 3d home theater set up for $ 1k
Projector	POS	5	let I start by say I like to buy american as much as possible . with that say ... I see no american company that can match the price of this quality product . the screen be bright and full size as advertise . the review that I read be dead on in regard to the 5 star rating . I have to wait about a month to get it as they be all sell out even from FAVI . the screen do curl slightly on either edge as -lrb- i guess -rrb- all non-tension screen do . however the black border be wide enough that it do not affect the picture at all . the motor be a little noisey and the screen seem to go up and down slowly . however at $ 163 for a 92in electric projection screen -lrb- deliver -rrb- you cant complain -lrb- I know I just do -rrb- . when people come into my theater roon -lrb- convert basement -rrb- they think I win the lottery and spend a mint on a new home theater . truth be tell I have less invester in my 92in , 7.1 , Blu-Ray system then I do in my 42in plasma 5.1 dvd system in my living room . so I guess except for support a China base product I love it so far . and yes when I be hungery and out of work I will need to eat my projector , projector screen and most of my other electronics ... still cant beat the price - deliver ...
Projector	NEG	2	I purchase this projtor base on the mostly positive review . First of all please note that this be not a hd projector . it simply accept hd signal via HDMI for example and the video signal be be downsize to VGA picture quality . furthermore , the color be completely off . I be debate with myself if it be worth it to send it back and get another projector and ask friend who be over and the verdict be that this hurt they eye . do you research and be aware of these factor . if you want a better picture , then simply go with a name brand .
Projector	NEG	2	this be a good concept however the delivery of the product be cheap at best . the container be make of metal that be too thin to actually hold together . critical bracket be break when I receive the unit . also the screen be dirty and this should never happen in a new product . would not buy another one .
Projector	POS	5	I get mine on sale last year . what a bargain . great pix , versitile , & super bright ! we can watch it in the daytime it be so bright . I use it on the road for my show so it get use & abuse a lot . it be still run perfect on it be original bulb . when it be not on the road it be use as my primary widescreen tv at home . this unit will not show full the resolution of true quality hdtv , but do a excellent job . many hdtv signal have be downscale , upscale , dowscale again , recompressed , & reprocess so many time by the time it reach you home , most of the channel be not true hdtv quality anymore anyhow ... esp . signal through cable & satellite . I guess the FCC have not pass any law for hdtv quality yet . the unit have more than enough resolution for ordinary DTV & DVDs . for some reason , I do not get eye fatigue like I do watch other projector a few hour . the factory preset be not that good & seem to be for watch ordinary analog TV & VHS tape . fortunatly it come with 3 user settable preset with a very wide array of setting & tweak that make it a top quality performer . I buy the component input adapter for it from Infocus . the quality of the adapter cable be poor & pick up plenty of RFI . also after carefully unplug it only a few time , one of the connector fall right off the adapter . poorly , cheaply design adapter concider most infocus product be specifically design to be use on the road , set up & tear down easily & quickly all the time . the connecter for my other road equipment do not break after year of heavy use . fortunately for the road & at home the s-video connector do a excellent job . do not ever use the ordinary rca-jack style composite signal jack on a hi-end tv or projector . the signal will not be good enough . any good tv will just make the poor signal quality more obvious . the above reviewer must have get a bad unit or one that be bang around during shipping , or be drop . these be durable unit , but with too much bang around , you 'll have problem the reviewer describe . the grind sound come from the color wheel or blower fan be knock out of alignment . I also own they older lp-350 xga model & use a few of they other model . so far I be very happy with all of they I have use . although my very old lp-350 still work like new , I have do some mod on it & the lens to increase the contrast ratio , brightness & bulb life . I be surprised that if I can do it , that infocus do not offer a mod plan for they to do it for a price . they will not even sell spec & technical service datum on they old machine . I guess they want you to pay a arm & leg for they to do repair , or buy a new one . I have have to fix a few infocus projector out of warranty after they be bang around or just get well use & old ... with no help or sevice datum from infocus , even though it be request . fortunately , dlp projector have be around for a while now , so there be plenty of qualify tech familiar with they in just about every town who know how to fix , mod , & upgrade they at a fraction of the cost infocus will once they be out of warranty . from what I read in the past , you be better off send it to a local tech with experience with dlp machine for repair rather than back to InFocus . they seem to do a better job cheaper , & know what they be do . Infocus will not even to tell you where to get special tool need to take they apart . I wonder if they know how to service they at all . it be one thing to build one , but another thing to troubleshoot & fix 'em . I give 5 star for the product , not for the service , because I service all my own equipment so do not need they . do not take these thing apart yourself people unless you know exactly what you be do & experience . you can ruin or destroy they if you be not very careful & knowledgable .
Projector	NEU	3	this project be very decent for the money you pay the picture image be not bad . however I be very excite to learn that this projector come with a spare bulb as we all know how expensive they could be . this be one of the main reason that drive I to buy this model once I recieve the item and try it out the bulb inside the projector be break . so much for the spare bulb .
Projector	POS	5	I be hesitant in buy a non familiar name FAVI , but by read the other review and what i be look for , this be the best bet . I be first impress by the packaging it come in . I read a few reviw where customer box be beat up and not work properly when the item first arrive . but with -lrb- retail ace -rrb- i be very happy with the packaging . second , i be impress by the quality of the product . the motor of the screen be very quiet . other customer have problem with the motor be too loud , but not with favus . after install the screen -lrb- which be very simple -rrb- i hook up my ps3 to it and see a dramatic difference in the quality . honestly im very happy with the screen and by purchase this great screen with such a great price you cant go wrong . Dont get confuse by purcash the $ 500 + screen when you can get a great product at a great price !!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS !
Projector	POS	4	I have use this with both my macbook pro and also my ipad with no problem . the re be great and the image be very bright . flawless performance .
Projector	NEU	3	basically this product be purchase because of the low cost and its description , take into account some feedback from other buyer . my expreiencium with it work very well , but in the dark , in a room you should turn off the light so you can watch it . he sharp left to say , especially the more control you must take care that the same projector , because he be the life of the projector . if you get lose or lose , it be like if you lose you projector , you may be handicap .
Projector	POS	5	absolutely thrill with this purchase . Pictures look great and dvd look super . exceptionally bright for it be size . razor sharp picture . other have comment about excessive fan noise but it be not so bad as to be a huge drawback . on board speaker however be very weak . but I be still thrill with the picture . love the size and weight of the projector . feel very sturdy . and a special piece of advice to those that purchase this ... when power the unit down let the unit run it be course in the shut down process ! it be very important that the unit cool itself off before it automatically turn the fan off . so do not power it off and then go and pull the plug out from the wall . let it run until the fan cut off -lrb- 90 seconds to 2 minute I think -rrb- .
Projector	POS	5	this be my first screen projector I purchase and I love because it give you a theater look and feeling . but , the only flaw to the projector that be throw to the screen be that it be hard to adjust to the size and you have to keep position the projector . the screen be not the problem it the projector throw so buyer beware to make sure you know the size of screen because if the projector do not throw right on the screen it will appear off the screen slightly or to much off the screen . once again it be not the screen that be the problem it be the projector that have to throw the image . other then that the screen be wonderful and I love it . for better imaging it be best to mount the projector in the ceiling for better throw . other then that I can not wait to use it outdoors !!
Projector	POS	4	I end up buy this Epson as it have the combination I be look for : size : as I need something very portable . money : as I do not want to spend over $ 600 . clarity : as I need to do PowerPoint presentation in well light medium size room with audience from 5-70 . I would say the this projecter exceed my expectation in all 3 category . the size be smaller than I expect . it fit perfectly along with my MacBook in the same briefcase which be not that big . the usb connection to my Mac work great and no setup need . it connect to my Mac via usb and via the include video cable -lrb- of course you need to have the MAC video adaptor if you wih to use the standard video cable -rrb- . calrity be great and the picture be sharp in the native 1024x768 resolution , enough in a well light room with a screen size of about 100 '' use economy mode . the only caveat be the fan sound be a bit loud , so in a smaller area it will be noticeable and will require you shift to economy mode , which be extremely reasonable . my thought be the projector small size have to do with the fan be noisy as there be no easy way to discharge so much heat through a small opening without much noise . lead projecto size be so small be tempting , but be a bit on the weak side for daylight . I check all of they -lrb- Optoma , Viewsonic , Acer and LG -rrb- . Casio be awesome but cost be -rrb- $ 800 , and the fan get a bit loud on this model as well . to get something in this size in lcd , I would have have to go to SVGA -lrb- 800x600 -rrb- . so for a combination of size , clarity and cost , this one be the best I could find . for $ 500 , this be a great deal . the carry case that come with it be great look and very functional , although I do not use it as like I say before - it fit in my pc case with ease . bottom line , if you need something that to use for powerpoint presentation and travels in the same case as you notebook , this be the one . it be easy to connect , it turn on and shut down super fast , and it auto correct its positining in a smart way . for the clarity and size , it be worth more than $ 500 . if you do not care about the size , there be many other option that will not be as loud as this one .
Projector	POS	5	finally , a projector that deliver on all front - I travel a lot in my role as a erp solution consultant and this projector be a must have . image quality be exceptional - that include the extra feature justify the higher price tag -lrb- have say that , I do not think this projector be overprice at all -rrb- . even in a room with standard office light the picture be very clear and text be also clear and sharp -lrb- this be often where cheaper model fall down -rrb- - brightness and contrast exceptional . I be not experience the noise issue that other reviewer be report - the fan be not obtrusive and be quieter than a lot of other projector that I have use . the light weight and size be perfect for true portability . the construction be by no means flimsy - very solid and robust . my aaa + + + purchase of the year .
Projector	POS	5	I have to write a review for this amazing product . I purchase my Qumi in August , so I have have enough time to play around with it and give a honest review . the picture quality be just amazing . I use to have a older Sanyo pj that be just standard def . replacement bulb for my Sanyo pj be $ 500 each ouch !!! the qumus seem like it be light year ahead of its time when I first see the image on my screen . the qumus do have to warm up for a few minute before the focus be clear . it be nothing major with 30,000 lamp life , if the few minute it take to focus bother anyone that much you can just leave this wonderful device on all the time -lrb- in eco mode -rrb- and you will never have to worry about the focus issue . sometimes I leave my qumus on for hour at a time because I do not have to worry about a bulb !!!! when I do leave it on for long period of time I simply switch from normal mode to eco mode and when I be ready to watch again turn normal mode back on and I be experience eye candy !! my wife like the pj also because it really do look like a oversize hdtv . I do have my Qumi in a dark basement , but I can leave on a couple of light -lrb- away from the screen -rrb- and the picture be bright enough . my brightness be not even all the way up it be like at 60 -lrb- can go to 100 -rrb- . as far as 3d be concern the qumus can put out a 3d image with extra hardware of course , but the qumus can do it . I watch Drive Angry 3d and the picture brightness be kind of dark , but in a dark environment the picture be still bright enough to enjoy a 3d movie . the qumus be a great product and the selling point for I be no more bulb to buy ! just turn on sit back and enjoy . you do not even have to worry about fall asleep with this many hour on the bulb . you could run this projector for 24 hour a day 7 day a week for 4 year before the bulb show any sign of fail . that be just wonderful ! fortunately , no one will run they Qumi for that long so therefore , you Qumi will last you for at least 10 year use it like you would you regular tv . hopefully by then the Qumi will be cheaper and I can have one in every room that use to have a hdtv . the future be look 300 lumen brighter , thanks qumus for a great product . I would recommend this product to anyone look for a economical way of enjoy hd on a huge screen .
Projector	POS	5	this cable trasmitt we pc signal and sound to a flat screen tv about 40 foot away with no problem . there be no signal issue and we be enjoy the option to view we digital content on the tv . the cable be rugged and feel like it be well make . I would purchase this item again with no regret .
Projector	NEU	3	I like this projector for its size . 8oz be so small , easy to carry , and fit anywhere . everything that come with it be great , and it come quickly . initially , it have a large , sharp picture . however , soon after receive it , dead pixel begin to appear to the point it be unusable . currently , it be be fix under its warranty . sorry I can not give any more information as to how that turn out ...
Projector	NEG	1	impress by review i get this projector but very disappointing ... it have scratch all over the body cover more than that project get over heated and get switch off every 10 min : -lrb- : -lrb- : -lrb-
Projector	POS	5	the projector be awesome for power point and work presentation . we be a small school and do not need to spend in excess for a major piece of equipment .
Projector	POS	4	look for a bright , portable , quiet projoector ? this be it . great keystone control and color depth and brightness . only downside -- zoom effect be highly lack . do not expect to shrink or enlarge the image much once you have the projector set up . but for the money -- perfect projector .
Projector	POS	5	this be my fourth projector and my second unit use a DLP chip . I can easily see rainbow in single chip dlp projector but this one almost completely eliminate they . I can still see a few rainbow , especially when there be bright object in a mostly dark scene , but it be hardly noticeable to I and none of my friend have be able to see they yet . if you be one of the few people who be bother by the rainbow effect , you may still want to demo this projector before purchase it online . I be originally use a gray screen in a light-controlled media room but the black with the darkchip3 be so good I move to a Stewart Filmscreen studiotek130 screenwall and the picture be spectacular . I recommend use a white screen with this unit . there be no gap between pixel or mirror dimple so the image be silky smooth . after calibrate with dve , the color be incredible . Colors pop , black be black and whites be white . Optoma have a zero dead pixel policy and a nice warranty . they also offer affordable -lrb- cheap , imo -rrb- extend warranty and upgrade service plan to meet you need . if you be in the market for a top-of-the-line single chip dlp projector , I honestly do not think you can get much better than this .
Projector	POS	4	Easy to use , fun for both inside and out . we use it for the WII and movie . Picture quality be like go to the movie , not hd . still , we watch most movie on this projector . Great for kid 's sleepover . my only issue be the sound level . it need on external speaker jack so you can place speaker in front . may be hard to hear when you sit in front of projector . I would definately recommend this for outdoor fun viewing .

Projector	POS	5	we need a projector pronto on one of my project . I volunteer to order one , and really find a good deal at Electronics Expo . good price , fast shipping , and very good quality product for a reasonable price . will use this seller again .
Projector	NEG	1	the VIVITAR 5000 arrive with the inner , MANUFACTURERS BOX , UNPROTECTED FROM the outer SHIPPING CARTON . both carton be intact ; HOWEVER , I assume it WAS drop very hard from a CONSIDERABLE HIGHT ... three of the four lens in the projector be knock OUT of THEIR BRACKETS and LOOSE in the VIVITAR ASSEMBLY RENDERING the projector completely inoperative . contact the shipper BROUGHT IMMEDIATE STATEMENT that it would be pick up at MY HOME ASAP BY UPS for RETURN and the send of a new unit .

Projector	POS	5	I finally get around to remodel the bedroom and do a little over and beyond the `` honey do list '' . since we be remodel , my wife finally agree to a tv in the bedroom but do not want any wire , amp , speaker , ect . in the room to clutter up the new clean look . so I hang a flat panel with this Yamaha ysp-1100 under it . -lrb- I highly recommend the wall bracket for a application like this -rrb- . the sub be hide in a undisclosed location and yes I hide the wire . step 1 complete . step 2 require I to make it work and make it easy . the auto-calibration feature be a snap . my bedroom be rectangular and the ysp-1100 sound amazing ! there be sound come from all around the room but look honey , `` no speaker '' . I program it be `` my Beam '' feature and so when one of we nod off , the other can still watch tv and not get the `` can you turn it down '' line . well it pass inspection from the Executive Director of the Interior aka the Mrs ! bottom line , it sound amazing , look cool and I highly recommend it . in fact , now my condo-livin ' brother-in-law want one and yep , it be be add to he `` honey do list '' .
Projector	POS	5	I use this to install a hc1500 mit . projector and I could not be happier with the product . it be very heavy duty , and have many adjustment . I can not think of a way it could be better .
Projector	POS	5	buy this in a hurry 14 month ago . over 2000 hour on the lamp so far . great picture for nightly movie with dinner . foreign film , comedy , everything play well for a family of film buff . Easy size adjust for various aspect ratio . lack focus control on remote , but fine for we ceiling mount .
Projector	POS	5	we old projector die , but the carosel slide holder be still good . they match the new projecter perfectly .
Projector	NEG	1	this projector need a lot of darkness in the room . the focus on it be very sensitive also . you basically get what you pay for , do not have high expectation for this device .
Projector	POS	5	I love this video projector ... for a incredible price it be turn my family room into a movie theater ! when I put CHICAGO in the dvd player and see it project by the InFocus x1 , I know I have what I would want all my life ... my own theater !! the clarity and color be absolutely amazing on my 84-inch diagonal screen .
Projector	NEG	1	we purchase a BenQ pb 6100 projector . if the overall quality of the projector be fine , such be not the case of the lamp which blow up in less than 6 week !!! and worse benq do NOT honor they international guarantee and the support center do not respond to the email for exchange the lamp -lrb- price 400 $ ! -rrb- . overall a very poor support . my last boxlight lamp be still run after 4 year . this be my first benq but surely the last . a strong suggestion , do not buy BenQ .
Projector	POS	5	so far I have have my projector for about a week and it work perfectly . I buy this know the cost and not expect the performance I would get from a $ 1000 projector . I assume anyone look to buy this do not have 500-2000 dollar to spend and just want a projector on a budget . so far this be it . I buy a refurbish one and get it ship for $ 230 . I have be use it everyday about 9-12 hour as a second monitor . it come with a extra bulb and all the cable list in the description . the cable and power cord be short so unless you plan on have it close get a longer cable . it say 800x600 but I have mine set at 1024x768 and it accept the signal use vga cord but anything over and the screen turn blue and say no signal . I try s-video hdtv out on my card but nothing display right unless I put it to 480 . I plan to get a vga to hdmi adapter and try the hdmus input on the projector . I hope then it will display 1080 without it be scramble . I hook up coaxial with expand cable tv and run the scan . it pick up the station but it must have the old style because none of the hd in between station work -lrb- ex-10 .1,10.2 -rrb- . some of the station be wrong and i would have to go under each one to manually adjust the frequency to get the right channel and get the clearest picture . also have to set the sound to the right kind to get that to work . I then try a antenna and nothing work so you will need a converter box to get those channel . I have spend much time tweaking the contrast ect . on the projector and my graphic card to get the picture right . the keystone adjustment be just up and down so you need to project straight parallel . the picture size depend on distance from screen so i recommend a ceiling mount so you do not have to have it setup on a table in the middle of the room . it have adjustment for both ceiling -lrb- flip -rrb- and rear -lrb- reversed -rrb- mode . for pixel and clarity I have mine setup about 9ft away with a screen size of almost 6ft wide and about 5ft tall . from 3 1\/2 foot and closer it have a obvious look through a screen effect . the pixel size with my screen size be 1\/16 inch square . right now i just project on a white wall and look good from 5ft back and beyond . my dislike be ; 1 . the fan be loud 2 . it have blank on the input side for usb , scart and card reader . I assume in the next model those input will be put in but its a bummer not have they in this model and see the spot for they . 3 . I have a longer vga cable but with the location of the input on the projector -lrb- cover be too close -rrb- the screw be not long enough on the one side tighten it in . overall I recommend this to whoever want a projector but can not spend over $ 300 . what convinced I to buy this be the fact bulb be 30-40 dollar and last 4000-6000hr . I could have spend $ 250 on a use projector that blow this one away in picture quality and spec but then I would be stick pay $ 200-300 every 3000hr on a new fixture . what I want be a huge picture I can use as much as a tv and not have to ration out the hour i put on the bulb . if you have any question feel free to comment and I hope my review help . just remember if you want perfect quality expect to pay for it , do not fool yourself into think this can compete with a $ 600 + projector .
Projector	POS	5	I set this up last night . I make no change to the color . my wife , son and he friend each be blow away by the better picture than we have with we Sony . brightness be a key issue for we as we screen be 215 inch diagonal .
Projector	POS	4	if you be in a situation where you have ambient light , or a large screen to fill this projector fit the bill . the important part be the six segment color wheel . a lot of dlp projector with this type of light output will cheat and use a seven segment wheel . the Seventh segment be white . that increase the brightness but wash out the color and ruin the contrast . those that be sensitive to DLP `` Rainbows '' will be very happy with the image quality . the projector support vertical and horizontal lens shift -lrb- critical for properly align the picture to the screen -rrb- , however it be a manual stick on the front of the project . zoom and focus be also manual by move two large ring around the lens . the build quality of the case be middle of the road , which be fine for fixed installation , but I would not recommend travel with it . give the price point of thousand less than compete projector those be fair compromise .
Projector	POS	4	every thing work . it do not need to be SDHC , regular sd can work also . it be very light , clear and the battery seem last quite some time . rca out work fine also . I do not have iphone so I do not test it . only con be the speaker be really bad and hard to understand what it be talk about . luckily my wife only need it for photo .
Projector	NEU	3	we do not have a television anymore , just a dvd player and we computer . the 3M Pocket Projector be great for we purpose - we can set it up anywhere and watch a show on any blank wall -lrb- or ceiling , or a cheapie cardboard screen if the wall be occupy -rrb- . the picture be a little dim in light room -lrb- to be expect -rrb- and of the four volume setting I find level 3 be a bit too soft and level 4 be a bit too loud in we 10x12 room , but that be minor . we camera tripod fit perfectly , and there be a jack for standard headphone for when my munchkin want to watch something for the umpteenth time that I just cant stand to listen to anymore . love it ! four and a half star ! - 09\/30\/11 Edited to add : I have have this unit for a year , and unfortunately now it overheat and shut down if the volume be turn above level 2 . the laptop do not always recognize that it be there either . not terribly convenient anymore , since we need three electrical outlet to watch a movie : dvd player , projector , external speaker . downgrade to three star .
Projector	POS	4	this be a pretty good value for the price . I wish it have focus on the remote -lrb- it be manual on the lamp -rrb- and I really wish the picture would scroll down smaller -lrb- it be too big for my screen from across the room -rrb- but it work properly , have good color , clear picture , and be easy to set up . vent get quite warm , pay attention to the warning label . good compact product . fast shipping from Amazon .
Projector	POS	5	this be my first projector mount , and will likely be my last . I be very hesitant to install a mount to begin with , my handyman skill be somewhat lack , but I really need to get my projector up and out of the way . I use this with a Epson 8350 . install the bracket onto the projector be a breeze , as be install the mount into the ceiling . the fine tuning of the positioning of the projector in the mount take a little time , but only because of my `` OCD '' . the adjustment screw hold the projector firmly in position and I have have zero issue with vibration or have to re-adjust the mount . for the price , this mount simply can not be beat imho .
Projector	POS	5	it be much more powerful than I expect . I like the size . it be too bad HP discontinue this model .
Projector	NEG	2	I buy a pc last year with the nVidia 3d system , it come with a Samsung monitor and it look fantastic . I instantly think `` i need a bigger screen '' so I go to nVidia 's page to view compatible display . the Optoma hd66 be and still be list as be compatible an support . so I buy one ... well guess what ? it be neither compatible or currently support . if you search the nvidium page you will find that if you hd66 be build before August of 2010 -lrb- that be right , August of 2010 ! -rrb- it will not work . I then call Optoma tech support and be tell by the phone tech that in order for it to work , it have to be send back to the factory for modification and that I would be responsible for the shipping ... I tell the guy that that be outrageous and I would simply return it and get something that actually do work as advertise . in case you wonder , I purchase the Acer h5360 . . I should have purchase it the first time around , not only do the 3d work flawlessly , it have way more feature than the hd66 like `` auto keystone , auto orientation , color wall compensation '' to name a few . if you look for a 3d projector that really deliver , you can wait two month till the actually compatible hd66 's hit the street -lrb- and hope they work -rrb- or you can get the Acer h5360 . of course deal with Amazon be the only way to go , the return of the hd66 be simple and I be enjoy real 3d in my living room on the Acer .
Projector	POS	5	do not get I wrong , there be room for improvement but for the price tag this little projector deliver . let 's start with the sound , I agree this projector do not have audio out , but this be not a issue with I , when use hdmus with my laptop because you can use smart audio software to disable the projector audio and send the sound straight to you laptop speaker or external speaker plug in to you laptop . I have Windows 7 and use a p500 Toshiba satellite laptop . I be able to connect this use a hdmus cable to both my DIRECTV HD receiver and laptop w\/hd and get 1080i picture with a 100 + '' 16:9 widescreen within approximately a 15 to 17 foot distance . if you can afford something more expensive I would say go for it , if you be look for true 720p or 1080p hd . however if you be on a tight budget this little projector be great and the picture do not disappoint even for hd . I be so happy I settle for this and do not spend so much more to get a hd -lrb- label -rrb- projector . this be very portable and I be use a regular camera tripod as a stand , and the whole experience be just awesome .
Projector	NEG	1	just like another person say , this product be garbage . I buy the 120 ft screen . I install it -lrb- pay someone to do this -rrb- and roll it down to start view a picture on it . the screen look great and I be happy until it be time to roll it back up . the retract mechanism do not work and my screen wont roll up no matter what I try . now Amazon want I to pay to ship this back and its look like it will cost a fortune due to its size . such a headache !!!!!!!!
Projector	NEG	1	the whole part be solid except the screw , shame when a screw break inside the connect plastic side of the projector , it ruin everything .
Projector	NEU	3	we need it the same day it arrive and we be able to use it without hardly look at direction , so ease of use good . but the clarity of a power point we load be not as good as we have hope . be not like the crisp demo they have load on it when it arrive .
Projector	POS	4	I love the picture quality . I hate the lack of internal memory . it would be far better if they have more . I have have to get a mini sd card to add what it lack . other than that it be great to have here in afghanistan .
Projector	POS	5	this be my second projector , and this one have much better feature . it have everything you need to watch a movie anywhere , all you need be some power . it have a lot of option to adjust the screen to adapt to any viewing location . it come with a travel case so that it stay well protect in transit .
Projector	POS	5	this be a excellent business class lcd projector that be easy to use right out of the box . the Epson be plug-and-play for pc , -lrb- mac require a driver installation -rrb- use either a VGA or usb connection . the usb cable be not include . there be also a composite video input as well . the projection be bright and clear , with vibrant color , even in partially light room , which make it ideal for business use . Powerpoint animation look good , and photographic background appear clearly define in medium light . the projector resolution be 1024x768 , which be standard resolution , and not widescreen , but since most screen roll out longer than they be wide , and many business environment be still use standard definition , this should not be a problem . the unit be reasonably light weight and compact , and have most feature that the average business user would need for presentation in the boardroom or on the road . even dvd movie be project pretty good , but not as well as presentation slide in medium to brightly light room . I would not recommend this projector for home movie view - there be better projector on the market specifically design for that . however , in it be class , I think this be a extremely well perform lcd projector .
Projector	POS	5	we order this because we older tv finally give out on we . I have to say that I be extremely pleased with this product . if there be some light in the room the picture be still very good . I would not say hd quality but it be a projector what do you expect . in a dark room hook up to we hd box the image project on we plain wall be better than the hd tv we buy a couple year ago !! it really be a great product . I imagine that with a screen behind it during the day would make the quality of the picture better . I would recommend this to anyone . for the price especially you can not beat it .
Projector	POS	4	I have have this for over two month now . the picture be a little lighter than I would like during the day -lrb- we have big window in the house -rrb- , but in the evening it look spectacular . we just project onto a white wall and it feel like we be in a movie theater . the volume be adequate for we living room , but it could have be a little louder . I also like that you can just insert a dvd and it power on by itself . this have make watch movie much more enjoyable , and it look better than the more expensive tv of friend that I have see because the picture be larger . I would give it 5 star if this be the whole story . the other day , it start make a beeping noise . another reviewer complain about this . it beep incessantly , like one beep every three seconds , and it be loud enough that it effect the audio . right now other people be in my living room watch a movie that I want to watch that I absolutely can not watch because the beeping be on my nerve . I be try to watch it on instant view on Netflix via the computer . I have do this before without a problem . one of the reason for get this projector be that we could hook the laptop up to it and project . it be work great for picture thus far . but it be beep the other day with the laptop , and it be beep today . so far , I have not notice beep with a regular dvd , but it do beep when a camera be hook up to it . this absolutely should not happen to technology this sophisticated . it sound very similar to the beeping that happen when the power be turn off and on . what a terrible idea to begin with . why create a machine that can beep at all in the first place ? it beep once it be turn on . it be not do it as some kind of warning , or because it be too hot . it have rest for over 24 hour . it be do it because there be a flaw in the machine itself . I be go to find my warranty and either get this replace , fix or return . it be really a shame because it be a cost-effective and nice machine otherwise . why give thing the capacity to beep that do not need to beep ? update : the next time I use it with the computer , it do not beep at first , but I have to stop it for something , and then it start beep again . I let it rest for about five day before watch another film via Netflix , and even some youtube astronomy video -lrb- which look beautiful by the way -rrb- and I do not have any beeping problem . I hope the beeping disappear , and I will call customer service if happen again . overall , I love the thing , assume that the beeping problem can be take care of . second update : still beep over a month later . consistently . I be extremely disappointed . final UPDATE : thanks to a great two year warranty , I be able to get the problem fix . they replace the light , and it seem to be work fine . they say that this problem be a rarity .
Projector	POS	5	buy for Iraq deployment ... awesome 5 ' + screen on the wall of my CHU -lrb- trailer -rrb- . definitely need external speaker\/headphones , but in a darkened room the picture be great .
Projector	POS	5	this clock do it all . love the ocean sound and be able to see the time on the ceiling . I realize that all this be not necessary but for the price you can not beat it . my daughter in law love it and order one too .
Projector	NEU	3	just remember , u get what you pay for . it be a cmo , not ccd . just wish u could take a picture and not video only .
Projector	POS	4	first , let I say , I would have give this projector 4.5 star if the rating be available . basically , it be a really good projector . it have everything you need , and the picture quality and brightness be really good . however , this unit be really big and not just a little ugly . I mean , I suppose the picture quality be the primary objective , but could not they have make it just a little prettier ? it do not actually look that much worse than other unit in shape , etc. . but it be huge , which make the utilitarian appearance stand out . also , it be white . which mean that if you want to use it as part of a home theater setup like I , it be more visible in a dark room . ugly and more visible make a bad combination . I be really happy with my projector . I be sure I 'll get a lot of use and satisfaction from it . but the first thing that go through my mind everytime I look at it be : `` wow ! that be a big , ugly projector ! ''
Projector	POS	4	the light blow out on my projector . this product be exactly as specify and just what I need . quick delivery time . thank you
Projector	POS	5	I be a little tentative before buy this projector due to the 800 x 600 svga picture , but I be pleasantly surprise that the picture be fantastic . it be bright and vivid , even with some ambient lighting . it do lack a hd input , but as another reviewer -lrb- blaser -rrb- note , you can get around this for less than $ 15 . buy a  VGA to RCA Component RGB Cable - 1.8 m - m\/m  if you need a hdmus input , this will do the trick :  VGA to HDMI Cable M\/M , 6 FT , Black -lrb- Video Card support necessary -rrb-  with these cheap accessory , you can use this projector for 100 '' screen gaming , tv and movie watching , and even computing . as a additional note , we use ours for work seminar and have it run all day with no heating issue .
Projector	POS	5	I be look for a projector to show Harry Potter for my son birthday and to watch movie outdoors this summer and my brother , who also own this model , say to try this one out because he love it . well he be right . the picture in a dark room be incredible . we have show it on the wall and on the EPSON DUET projector screen -lrb- which be pretty cool too -rrb- . we have watch the final four -lrb- from a dish network receiver -rrb- , Shrek 4 -lrb- from a Samsung Blue Ray Player -rrb- , Legends of the Guardian -lrb- from the PS3 -rrb- , and Tron -lrb- from a dish network receiver -rrb- . the color be all incredible and the black level be great . the only minor issue I have be that the projector would not find my Samsung Blue Ray player with a 25 ft hdmus cable , but it would with a 10 ft cable . not a projector issue I be sure as the 25 ft cable work with the projector and the PS3 . in a well light room the projector look okay -lrb- obviously not as good as when the room be dark -rrb- . with a little light filter into the room , the projector still look really good . I also adjust setting accord to one of the other review and it seem to make the picture even better than it look out of the box -lrb- which be still really good -rrb- . if you need a great little projector at a great little price , go for it .
Projector	POS	5	I live in a condo and have no room for a 100 '' permanent screen . I have a nice tv and surround sound setup , but for special movie or event I want a BIG picture . so I buy this screen with the intention of put it in front of my tv when need . this way I can still sit on my couch and still have my speaker orient correctly , etc. . some of the review scare the heck out I . -lrb- damaged arrival , etc -rrb- . Mine be package very well . first I have to remove tie wrap that hold cardboard corner edge on all 4 side ; much like a molding that run down the entire length of the box . then , I open the box to find another box inside that one ! open the inner box reveal foam wrap material and foam corner . the screen be inside this . it be in perfect condition ! the only criticism I can see be that it be not 100 % flat . but roll up\/down screen never be . I watch a movie , play some PS3 , and the lack of perfect flatness be not noticeable to I . in all , I love the purchase ! I consider give it 4 star since it be not `` perfectly flat '' , but then give it 5 because its not fair to expect that and more importantly it be not noticeable .
Projector	POS	4	do not pay attention to the review suggest that the bulb be a hassle . this be a good product , and I think I know what happen with he . the first bulb probably have a problem , and that be why Toshiba replace it at no cost . but if he install the next bulb incorrectly , the lifespan be shorten exponentially , so be sure to do it right . and as for the price of the bulb , they be expensive , but he be exaggerate just a bit . I just buy one on the internet a week ago for $ 260 -lrb- tax free -rrb- and it be already here . as for I , I use my projector extensively , probably 5-7 hour a day . it last about a year and a half for I , which be more than I think it would . all in all , this be much better than a big screen t.v. , and cheaper ... good buy .
Projector	POS	5	this be my second pj and I love it . it be smaller and brighter than the hc1500 I have . I want a 3d set up so I buy this along with the 3dxl and it have be a amazing experience . watch bluray be kick ass !! and play PS3 in 3D be too much !!! best purchase I have make in a looooooong time . - Abel Z.
Projector	POS	5	this be the first projestor we have own but we be very impressed and can not imagine how the picture coutl get better .
Projector	NEU	3	I get the product relatively quickly and it work as intend however I think if this be sell as a universal mount it should come with way more assortment of screw and washer\/spacers in order to accomodate most projector . also the joint could use some lock washer in order to prevent they from move under weight .
Keyboard	POS	5	always a satisfaction to buy a Microsoft product . and this product be not different , exelente comfort and usual to who pass much time typing .
Keyboard	POS	5	this thinkg work great ! I stream tv show through my computer onto my tv . I use thing as a remote so i can do everything from my couch ! the battery last a very long time too ! it hasnt die on I yet and its be leave on for 5 day .
Keyboard	NEG	2	I love Logitech , and I hold they product to a higher standard than the rest . this one be well-designed , but it have a serious problem -lrb- for gamer , at least -rrb- . overall , this be a good , attractive board -- assume you do not get the problem I have . the board work most of the time , but randomly , sometimes a couple time a hour , the light will blink and it will turn itself off . then , even when the board become power again , it will not work . this be insanely annoying in FPS game , especially multiplayer one . I have make sure that this be not a issue with my computer itself . it be isolate to the keyboard . ignore that problem , the board be pretty good . it be comfortable , feel solid , and have lot of button -lrb- include 18 macro on the left side , very useful -rrb- . it be not ergonomic at all , but that be not a big issue for gamer . the key have smooth response with just the right amount of push force , and the board look good overall . it be not without its shortcoming . the lighting be somewhat uneven and sometimes look a bit cheap . if you have you keyboard right in front of you monitor -lrb- s -rrb- , the light key may be harder to see than normal white one . I really wish all the blue key be as bright as the yellow m1 key . the board include two usb port , but they be only usb 1.1 . it would be nice to plug mouse into they , since it would give a wire gamer more travel slack on the cord , but for I , I find it too risky to plug my mx-518 into it because of the risk of lose both my mouse and keyboard to the power loss . the lesson I learn ? fancy gimmick do not a gaming board make . light and fancy frill be a excuse to skimp on other , more important thing .
Keyboard	POS	5	I be look for a mouse\/keyboard combo . the best mouse that I could find be by logitech , but be not pair with a keyboard . so I buy this keyboard and it go perfectly with my mouse and the computer .
Keyboard	POS	4	price at $ 99.99 be a bargain . with the upcome Honeycomb firmware come soon this differently will be the streaming media to have . I love the feature and easy access with the include keyboard . I have the roku streaming media as well and use both due to that some content can not be find in one or the other device . but over all be aim to stream more content via internet integration and will get better as soon the new release version become available .
Keyboard	POS	5	use my laptop at home I find myself touch the cursor pad , and move it around what I be typing . also my old mouse be act up , so I get this combo pack . it do and excellent job & I would recommend it to anyone .  Logitech Wireless Desktop mk320 with keyboard and mouse
Keyboard	POS	4	I drop the cash on this expect just a average product , or just a cheap knockoff of the much more fancy $ 30 cover from the iSkin website . I be pleasantly surprise when I open the package and stick it on , and find that it just happen to be pretty dang snazzy . it look good , feel good , and fit really well . the key line up perfectly , none of that awkward double character effect . the backlighting be subdue a lot , but not so much that it be render useless or anything . as far as typing go , it feel natural . it take about 2 minute to get use to it , then the `` this be weird '' effect wear off . not to mention , this cover just make any typing SO SO comfortable ! the post do say high grade silicone , and they deliver on that ! overall : Worth the money , but I would caution buyer about the packaging when ship . seriously ? a envelope ? I pay $ 4.95 to have this ship , and it come to I in a old brown envelope . the product be fine , but there be much that could have go wrong . beyond that however , I highly recommend this product , it will extend the life of you mac at least 5 fold .
Keyboard	POS	5	ok - this thing be really inexpensive ; which be great . I really only buy it for the colorful splash it would give my computer , and it do that perfectly . here be the irony of the whole purchase ... within a half hour of the box deliver , a spill 1\/2 a open soda all over my laptop . without this sweet cover , my computer would have be toast . BEST $ 5 I have ever spent !!
Keyboard	POS	5	as a full size keyboard and full fuction mouse with great range , this be a excellent product . set-up take a minute or so and the connection with the computer be do from a very small usb connector . since I rarely use all my usb slot this work perfectly for I . when the connector be put in , it automatically download the driver to Windows 7 . I be use the combo a couple of minute after open the box . what I like about the keyboard be that be extremely easy to get use to and full size . I rarely make a typing mistake , it have all the key I need and I have go back a good 20 foot and it be still within-range of the usb connector . there be really no waste space on the keyboard but at the same time it do not seem crowd . but this be the one drawback for some people that I want to point out . the keyboard be long and rigid . it could become a transportation problem depend upon how people want to use this product . if you be use a small netbook this would be a excellent product at home or at work , but if you want it as a travel companion be aware of the size . the mouse also have great range , good feel , and it have work on every surface I have try it on without lose any accuracy . the software will install if you want a small screen box that allow you to do cap and number lock from the screen and also show you the connection and battery status of the keyboard and mouse . Bottomline be a good quality product and a good value for the price . it would make use a netbook or even a laptop much easier . battery be supply , set-up be easy , and you will be up and click and typing in a couple of minute . just know what you want . this be a rigid-non folding keyboard that be quite long . if you be ok with that , then this be a excellent choice .
Keyboard	POS	5	buy the wireless keyboard and mouse for use it with my MacBook pro OS X 10.6.8 . Works well for all the basic function . note on keyboard 1 . Amazon state operate only with the window pc but check with Logitech confirm it should work fine with the Macs as well . 2 . out of the `` fn '' key capability I could only make the power off key to work . all the other be tie to operate for window . 3 . from the additional extra feature key locate on the very top of the of the keyboard , I could make only the forward , play , reverse , volume and folder key to work . calculator key do not work . 4 . basic qwerty keyboard work fine . 5 . use the `` window key '' as the Mac command key to operate you regular mac feature . it work well for my need . I have not experience any obvious issue with the mouse and it seem to work fine . as for battery life it all depend on usage but I know its not bad as I have not have to replace battery since I buy it . tip : switch off the keyboard and mouse at the end of the day or whenever you do not intend to use the device for a long period of time . this definitely conserve battery power .
Keyboard	POS	5	when my 3-year old Microsoft wireless keyboard bit the dust last week , I have to briefly use a spare , straight , non-ergonomic keyboard and it feel awful . what a relief when I get the Logitech keyboard in the mail yesterday ! very comfortable to type on , fit my keyboard tray just right , feel better to type on than the Microsoft keyboard do . and the laser mouse that come with it in this combo package also be a pleasure to use . the keyboard have a lot of functional capability that I probably will not use , but that be just icing on the cake . the comfort , for I , be the best feature of this keyboard . this be a excellent choice , if I do say so myself .
Keyboard	POS	5	my girlfriend want this for she MacBook pro . she purchase a pink case on Amazon as well and I think she would like this one and she be be want a keyboard cover . as soon as she get it , she love right away .
Keyboard	POS	5	when I really like a product , I be always curious about the negative review . with this keyboard , it appear that these concern personal preference that no single keyboard can fulfill for all user . I guess that some day there may be a keyboard that can be modify by the user to any sublayout , key size , and the like . this keyboard can not do that , but it be about as perfect for I as they come . the keyboard layout be standard and straightforward : no touchpad , special key , etc. -lrb- well , there be those speaker key above the numeric keypad . . I do not use they , but they also do not make the keyboard larger -rrb- . I like that because it keep the size to a minimum without diminish the usefulness -- for I . it be not particularly important to I that it be really thin , but I really like that look . now the important stuff . the key feel good to I , and I think that as long as key have good tactile feedback , you will get use to whatever keyboard you use and come to like that feel . you brain adapt , which mean that if you use another keyboard with a different feel , you will not favor that at first either . someone do note that the f and j key be not as easy to feel as on some keyboard , but you get use to that as well . I be attract to this keyboard because I sometimes like to work in a room with muted illumination . I would find that sometimes I would need to punch a key that I do not use much -lrb- say , a f-function key -rrb- and would struggle to find it . that be not a problem now . I start use wireless keyboard 2 keyboard ago , and will never go back to cable . I love not have another cable on my desktop . plus , I can type with the keyboard in another position if I have to -lrb- troubleshoot the computer , etc. -rrb- . the tradeoff have always be the battery , but the rechargeable nature of this keyboard be wonderful . I charge they first when I get the keyboard about a month ago , and it be still on full . and , if the battery need recharge , I just plug in the usb cable for a hour or so , and can still use the keyboard . I have to admit that I really like Logitech product , have be use they since the first 3-button -lrb- ! -rrb- mouse in the early 1980 's . I have never use a Logitech product I do not like . maybe I be bias .
Keyboard	POS	5	the item be great , it work especially well in poorly light area ! the back light keyboard have be the best I have see and I highly recommend
Keyboard	POS	4	the Steelseries g6v2 be space efficient , heavy , and have a excellent tactile feel to it . it be a perfect keyboard for those who never have a mechanical keyboard before . the only criticism I have be that the shift key and backspace feel different and worn compare the the rest of the key and that the Return\/Enter key displace the \ | key down near \/ ? which be tricky to get use to .
Keyboard	POS	5	if you be in need of a serviceable replacement for you Mac keyboard , at a fraction of the price of a Mac brand keyboard , this be the keyboard you want . it be a little noisier than the Mac keyboard , but in term of user-friendliness and styling you will not do better in term of function or price . the media key at the top of the keyboard be handy too . the only superfluous key seem to be the power on key at the top right , which will not actually power on my iMac . I still have to hit the power on button on the back of the iMac unit itself . other than that , I find this keyboard a great , neatly-priced replacement for my old Mac keyboard , which start to lose key function , key by key .
Keyboard	POS	4	overall , this item be well worth the money . I would like it if it have more clip on the top of the screen but overall it be secure and fit well . look just like the picture .
Keyboard	NEG	1	this adapter would not connect any work PS\/2 keyboard to the usb port on either of the two pc I need to connect . very unsatisfactory . I solve my problem with a different -lrb- keyboard & mouse -rrb- adapter .
Keyboard	NEG	2	this keyboard be cheaper than its Sony brand competitor for a excellent reason - it be simply not as good . I be a fairly good typist , and this be \* much \* slower than use Graffiti to enter information .  you have to poke and push very hard to get the keystroke to register , and the divide nature of the keyboard make it very difficult to get up any speed at all . I could not type more than a few word without have to go back and add miss or extra letter .  I would only recommend this keyboard if you can not cope with graffitus at all . enter any large amount of text will simply take you too long and drive you insane with the pointlessness of become a two-fingered typist otherwise .
Keyboard	NEU	3	this be a great keyboard in theory . I love the feel and consistency of the key , and the variability of the backlight . I can do some serious typing on this keyboard and enjoy every moment of it . well , assume I remove all of the macro key , which I do . they get in the way -- I align my hand by feel , base on where my left pinky find the edge of the last row of key . if you stick a extra column of key there , I line up too far to the left and disaster and frustration ensue . for a day or so I try to jam my pinky in the crevasse between the macro key and the normal key , but that be uncomfortable and make it difficult to hit Tab . then I try to position my hand in a more traditional typing posture , which do not work very well . I could have stick with it and re-learn to type , but I like the way I type now and do not want to change , so I pop off the macro key and all be well . only downside be , the blue led be pretty bright without key to obscure they . I might paint or tape over they . issue number two be that in low light , the painting on the key be very hard to see because it be dark gray . the light-up portion of the key be fine -- perfect , in fact . the altered font do not bother I at all . what do bother I be that I have to lean in and closely examine the key to figure out what they shift function be because I can not see they . Blue lead + dark gray paint + black key = very poor usability and visibility , especially in low or no light situation . lastly , my keyboard arrive defective , but it take a day or two to notice how . the spacebar be just a little too loose , so when I hit it at any kind of angle with my thumb , it will grind against the x or the m key , depend on which thumb I use . this cause superfluous xe and m , cause I lot of frustration . I try to adjust the spacebar to see if it be out of alignment or something -- there be nothing I can do , it be just not work right and have to go back . so I have request a exchange from Amazon . unfortunately , it be out of stock and I be still wait for a new one after two week . in summary , I like this keyboard and can not imagine use anything else anymore . I just wish it be better design and better manufacture .
Keyboard	POS	5	this keyboard be great . it install instantly and be work flawlessly ... for a reasonable price . the curvature of the keyboard be a nice touch as I do a lot of typing .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I originally give this a high rating but remove it when , after have it for only a couple of week , find that a entire row of key stop work . I originally like the price , about a third of a Apple original , the light and compact frame and the action of the key , but seriously , I will not buy this brand again and will think twice about the re-seller as well .
Keyboard	POS	4	personally , I love this keyboard . no one be more resistant to change than I be , so it be highly unusual for I to try , let alone use , such a untraditional-looking product . this keyboard do take a little get use to -- make no mistake about that . the hardest thing for I have be find the `` 6 '' key -lrb- across the top -rrb- -- it be on the leave `` half '' of the keyboard , a fact which my right hand sometimes have trouble remember . yes , the arrow key be a little small , and the Insert-Delete-Home-End-PageUp-PageDown key be not really `` instinctively '' position , but the Delete key be the only one of these that I use a great deal , and it be still at the bottom left of that set of key , just where it should be . I use a standard keyboard all day at work , and I have no problem go back and forth between the two , so that should not be too big of a issue among prospective buyer of this product .  while I have no wrist problem , I know that I do not type `` correctly . '' I have try wrist pad before , and I utterly despise they . I be not the type of person to buy something because it be `` ergonomic . '' frankly , I buy this keyboard because it be `` unusual '' and because I still trust Microsoft 's name on a product . as it turn out , I get a comfortable keyboard that just so happen to significantly help my typing posture -- not a bad deal . you can buy a keyboard with a bunch of internet and shortcut key , but why waste money on those little extra ? give this keyboard a try , especially those of you who just can not stand wrist pad , and I bet you -lrb- and you wrist -rrb- will come to really like this product .
Keyboard	NEG	2	I give this product a try hope to use it to control my media laptop connect to my home theater . it look and feel solid in the hand and come in a nice box . unfortunately , while the product work fine close to the laptop , if the unit be more than 4 foot away from the receiver it only work intermittantly and by the time you reach 6ft away it do not respond at all . it just do not work when I be sit on my couch try to control the laptop . also for some odd reason if I use the laser pointer -lrb- which I honestly care nothing about -rrb- it would break the bluetooth pairing and you would need to use another mouse to re-connect the device I may have recive a faulty unit but I have notice other complain of short range as well so I have decide to return the unit for a refund and explore other option .
Keyboard	POS	4	good product ! - the keypad feel good - soft and rubbery . - soften key click slightly , but more than that it change the sound . I like the new sound more . - I be sure it protect the keyboard well . nothing 's happen to it yet since I get the product today , but from other review it protect from spill , dust , dirt , etc. . but a couple of problem : - CAN NOT see the letter on the key with the backlight - normally it shine through the clear letter on the key but it do not anymore . this be probably the biggest problem with it -lrb- and clearly not a huge deal -rrb- - it be be less than a day of use it and a tiny hole have appear . I do not know if it be there when it ship or if my brother tear it , or if it be a problem with the product itself , but it be there -lrb- although it be really really small . -rrb- - came in the mail so it be a little bent , and not quite a perfect fit on the arrow key or the edge . - dust stick to it since it be a little sticky . I have not wash it yet but hopefully it 'll be easy to wash . over all , it look , feel , and sound great , but it do not work as well as I hope . but since it be on sale when I buy it - go down from 20 dollar to 2.48 - it be definitely worth the price . I would buy it for up to 5 dollar - buy it for any more would be a waste .
Keyboard	NEG	1	do yourself a favor and save yourself the 90 + dollar . this thing be a flimsy , cheap plastic piece of junk that rely on the pressure of two plastic piece , compress together to keep itself attach to you chair . I be very excite to try this out , since I renovate my office a bit and remove my formal desk , and now need a place to rest my kbd and mouse . talk about depressing . the box it come in have better production value . first , the keyboard tray be completely separate from the rest of the mount item , so at any second the thing be bump , jiggle , or downright fall off during normal movement . not to mention it be literally a black piece of plastic no better or bigger than the smallest , cheapest cut board you could buy for you kitchen . next , the armrest mount , when mount evenly have a little piece that fit inside in order to adjust for the curve of you chair armrest . this piece will fall out with hardly any provocation . also , the bracket that hold the front and back in place be do so with screw - that 's right - it be not like they be adjustable , smooth piece that snap into place like you would expect - you literally have to take these small rough edge bracket and screw they into the bottom of the armrest cover . and because you be simply hold they in place with pressure - guess what - any bump against the back of the armrest cover and the whole thing slide forward dump everything in the floor . oh and do I mention that if you use this on a chair with a wood frame you just scratch the hell out of the wood ? yea - you do . additionally , the armrest sit in so far that unless you have a super-sized chair base , or be anorexic , you can expect to not be able to spread out , or sit as comfortably as you like , or on some chair , literally have this thing dig into you . I could see where you basic , run of the mill , 30 dollar office chair with a short back and tiny armrest would probably do ok with this thing -lrb- but then , why would you need it since you would probably have a desk to go with that kind of chair -rrb- , but for 90 dollar - I mean really - 90 buck ?? - you would be better off get one of those laptop station with the beanbag bottom that fit in you lap for half the price . I literally put this thing on three different chair , test each one for a full hour or so of normal operation , and throw it back in the box . mobo should be ashamed of themselves for put such a price tag of this crap . this be not worth it , but spend you money how you want .
Keyboard	POS	5	i recently buy this item as a christmas gift and i test it out to make sure it be worth what i have pay for it . and it be ! this lightweight keyboard be a must have . i do not have any reception problem and the mouse be so great . it feature many shortcut for internet surfer . it be comfortable and stowsaway easily when not in use .
Keyboard	POS	4	I have recently be give the opportunity to work at home . by which I mean , the boss tell I that `` nobody in this office want to look at you dumb face any more '' . ` Opportunity ' , ` ostracism ' . it be all semantics . anyway , if my face and I be go to work at home , I want to do it in comfort . so I set about make myself a ergonomic space to work in . if I really want to cast off the shackle of workplace injury , I have to escape from the desk . with this keyboard , I can type in any position -- sit in my chair , hold it in my lap , lie on the floor , or stretch out on the couch . especially stretch out on the couch . grant , I can not see the monitor from there , but as long as the keyboard be in my hand -- or by my foot , or under my head while I be doze -- then I be ` work ' . a awful lot of my email start out `` Dear fksannnnnnn ... '' , but that be a small price to pay for eliminate repetitive motion injury and wonky back spasm . awesome product !
Keyboard	POS	4	still love the layout of this keyboard . I can not stand typing on a standard keyboard for over a few hour , and this one seem to fit I best ergonomically . it be a little pricey for be so loud -lrb- clickity click click -rrb- , but still my favorite solution .
Keyboard	POS	5	I get this a replacement for another keyboard that die on we . we have only have it a few week , but no complaint here . it work well and do not feel cheap .
Keyboard	NEG	1	`` Works with you exist hdtv and cable or satellite system to provide seamless access to the web , you tv , compatible dvr , and Android app ... '' no , it do not . the revue do not give you `` seamless access to the web . '' and it do not allow you to download and run android app . I buy a revue when it be first release . since then software `` update '' have make it actually do less than when I first get it . when it first arrive I could use it to browse and play video from my media server . now , it display `` Network Error '' as I try to browse folder on the server and , if I be lucky enough to be able to list the video in a folder , it display `` Video Error '' for about half the video I try to play . the hardware be great . the software be not . we have be promise update to the software for month and all we get be `` security update '' that break existing functionality . until the software be fix , statement like `` Works with you exist hdtv and cable or satellite system to provide seamless access to the web , you tv , compatible dvr , and Android app ... '' be out-right lie and false advertising .
Keyboard	POS	4	I be use the keyboard for a computer I have hook up to my live room television , when I be sit on my couch . need to get a usb extension cord to make sure the keyboard could see the receiver , but after that it be work pretty well . miss letter sometimes when I get in a fast typing groove , but overall , it work great for its purpose , be a convenient keyboard and mouse pad together that I can use across the room . a standard keyboard and mouse be definitely better , mean more precise , and less miss , if you situation would allow for it .
Keyboard	POS	4	I buy this keyboard for use with a new raspberry pi . unfortunately , it cause problem with the r-pi and force you to unplug the keyboard and plug it back in again after about 50 keystroke . otherwise , its a nice keyboard for the price . Works fine on my Mac . some of the key be a bit small and it will take some get use to .
Keyboard	POS	4	great product ! it be a minor adjustment get use to key , as they seem to ` stick ' at first . -lrb- though the skin be soft and smooth , not tacky . -rrb- in particular , the space bar be a issue for I , need too apply more pressure for it to work . less of a problem , now that my finger have adjust . also , I love that the keyboard be protect from the usual dust\/dirt , require less cleaning , and less worry about spill ! the color be fun , too . I 'll probably order the blue and the black , too !
Keyboard	NEG	2	feature be great , however it have some issue where if you press the space bar on the top right corner , then it produce friction with the body of the keyboard . the friction thus cause the space bar to not go down at once or it cause the user to have to apply more -lrb- un-ergonomic -rrb- pressure .
Keyboard	POS	4	I have have no problem , the keyboard be good and I enjoy typing on it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy this as a replacement for a old -lrb- but good , I think -rrb- Gateway keyboard . this be the best keyboard I have use in my 30 year of use computer . well build and for I it be the Rolls Royce of keyboard . the fact that it be a smaller layout work fine for I . I have average size hand that fit very nicely on the soft touch key . plus it be a classy look piece
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use this keyboard at work for year and like it so much that I purchase one for home use as well .
Keyboard	POS	4	have the infrare version as well this by far be the best ir need to be point to the computer and you need to constantly check the screen if you mistype anything its not the case with this BT device love the size love the mousepad work great def reco
Keyboard	NEU	3	Disapointed in the `` super-loose '' feel of the mouse scroll wheel and the mouse 's smallish overall size . also , I would have prefer a larger keyboard delete key which be on other model .
Keyboard	POS	5	I receive this today in the mail and start use it as soon as I open the box . it require 2 AAA Batteries so if you do not want to be replace the battery every so often I would recommend buy some rechargeable one . now for the main review ... \* the keybaord be very slim and it have a nice look to it . it really do look like a original Apple Keyboard except the material be different . \* if you dont use it for a certain amount of time the keyboard automatically stop work with the device until you press a button on the keyboard . this be very convincent in order to save battery life . \* it have numerous button the control feature such as the brightness of the screen of the device and the volume of the device . this be also very convinient instead of go into you setting to change something like that . \* I be a pretty fast typer and there be no lag what so ever on this keyboard . I have have other keyboard before in which I experience lag , but not in this one . overall this be a really great keyboard that I recommend for all of you that want to type faster than use you touch keyboard . I rate this product 5 star out of 5 star ! no bad thing about it what so ever ! I hope this review help you out !
Keyboard	POS	5	this be a standard Dell keyboard . as such it be very high quality , it be great to find one at this price .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I switch over to bluetooth keyboard and mouse from the lenovo after 6 mouth of use . i be shock how fast the bluetooth keyboard be compare to this . the rollerball be bad on my hand and do not move that far .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I buy the mouse\/keyboard to supplement my office laptop for two reason :  1 -rrb- for ergonomic reason , I want a wireless keyboard that fit into my desk 's small pull-out keyboard tray , while still allow room for a full-size mouse on the same tray . the keyboard fit perfectly . the keyboard be similar in size to a laptop keyboard , so do not buy it if you want a regular full-size desktop keyboard .  2 -rrb- the idea of a in-air mouse seem cool . ok , it be cool , but it be not easy to control smoothly . the only situation where I 'll use the in-air function be when I be give a presentation with my laptop screen be project onto a wall screen , and I need stand away from the laptop .  as someone who have suffer a previous repetitive stress injury related to computer usage , I find my hand hurt use this mouse within the first hour of use . in my opinion , the mouse be too narrow , cause I to unnaturally clench my hand around the mouse to grasp it . as such , I do not use the mouse . everyone be different . test this mouse at a store , if you can , before purchase .  my solution be to buy a separate Microsoft wireless mouse . yeah , that be right , I have separate usb antenna for my keyboard and mouse plug into my laptop . it be a shame about the Gyration mouse be narrow , because I think a in-air mouse would have good potential for people with certain disability . a crude measurement show perhaps a 3\/8ths of a inch difference in the width of the front end of the two mouse , but the contour of a wider mouse be important to I .
Keyboard	POS	4	if you spend a lot of time in front of a computer , you should invest the money to get the right keyboard for you usage . Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard rate somewhere between three-and-a-half star and four star for those who risk carpel tunnel syndrome from overuse of computer mouse , e.g. , in corporate financial analyst circle . the UltraNav keyboard mitigate problem cause from overuse of computer mouse by incorporate TrackPoint and touchpad point device on the keyboard itself . compare to the grip that be require to actively control a mouse , the TrackPoint require pressure from only one finger ; while the touchpad can be control by a light touch . as other reviewer indicate , Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard be lightweight , and of a solid build quality . I find the UltraNav 's trackpoint to be perfectly configure out-of-box . other trackpoint device -lrb- I have use Dell and HP Compaq corporate laptop -rrb- feel `` loose '' by comparison . the UltraNav 's touchpad support virtual click -- which simulate mouse click by quickly tap on the touchpad ; and virtual scrolling -- which enable quick scroll down or across a window by slide one 's finger down the right side of the touchpad , or across the bottom of the touchpad , respectively . the touchpad 's driver software enable both feature to be tailor to preference , and come with a practice `` game '' to help ensure that one 's preference be just right . the UltraNav TrackPoint come with a third button -lrb- in addition to the standard left - and right-click button -rrb- that can act either as a scroll lock or a magnifying glass . both the touchpad and TrackPoint may be adjust for left-handed use . both be also simultaneously active , but one or both may be deactivate or set to use a subset of they feature . I keep both enable ; I use the touchpad to move around broadly , and the trackpoint to move around and select item more precisely . with Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard , a mouse be no longer need . the downside to the UltraNav keyboard generally revolve around its lineage as a ThinkPad laptop keyboard . like most other laptop keyboard , the UltraNav keyboard have tiny function key , and tiny Insert , Delete , Home , End , pageup and pagedown key . several keyboard function -- include the three volume button , the Fn key , and the blue mechanic -lrb- thinkvantage -rrb- key -- may be render useless for those who do not pair they UltraNav keyboard with a Lenovo computer . Lenovo should have be smart enough to include software to help such user remap all of those non-functional key to do something more useful . this keyboard also lack Windows key -lrb- the Windows key and right-click key -rrb- , and instead have -lrb- previous Page -rrb- and -lrb- next Page -rrb- key . I be not convince of the utility of the latter , because it be just as easy to press   and   to move backwards and forwards in a web browser . the UltraNav keyboard also include two usb 1.1 port ; which be less useful today than when this product be introduce , since many usb device these day can take advantage of higher usb 2 speed . remember to install the UltraNav driver - before - plug in the keyboard into you computer for the first time . Windows Vista 64-bit user should consider use the latest generic driver from synaptic because Lenovo 's Vista 64-bit driver do not support virtual scroll for the touchpad . both the Synaptics and Lenovo driver however , do not support the magnifying glass action for the Trackpoint 's third-button . Lenovo 's UltraNav keyboard merit serious consideration from those seek a solid alternative to computer mouse , and can sacrifice a bit of keyboard functionality . hopefully the next version of this keyboard will incorporate with Windows key -lrb- since they be make available in the ThinkPad 60 series keyboard -rrb- , usb2 port , and maybe multi-touch support for the touchpad .
Keyboard	POS	5	I get a new Lenovo Thinkpad x201 with docking station to replace my old corporate rig , and alas there be no place for a serial keyboard -lrb- dinosaur -rrb- , so I need a usb keyboard . this keyboard look like it fit the bill , and since I also already have a nice Logitech wireless keyboard\/mouse setup for my home system , I think I would give this keyboard a try too . it work perfectly , install automatically in Windows 7 . it be very comfortable to type on -lrb- fast -rrb- , and have really nice no-slip rubber foot on the bottom . you literally can not go wrong with this as a good basic keyboard .
Keyboard	NEG	2	buy if you enjoy turn off the numlock key every time you turn on you computer . otherwise you password will fail . the designer make a stupid gaffe with this design . most recent computer have remove numlock setting in the bio . so buy this if you like to remember to do unnecessary task . in other word the keyboard be the opposite of convenient - frustrate to use . enjoy !
Keyboard	NEU	3	I be use this on a Toshiba laptop , and it work as soon as the bluetooth wizard configure the device . the problem be , once I shut off the keyboard , I have to go through it all again . however , window bluetooth manager show the device be connect , but the keyboard do not even transmit a signal . at this point , I have to remove the device from the list device , and re-install it . then it work , just as before . but , I drive a limo and will use it to allow my customer to browse the web for tv and music video . and , thus , I need two . one for they , and one for I up front , in case something happen and I have to fix a problem . so , with the dongle that be in the drawer , they both work fine , at the same time . the bluetooth dongle I have , get confuse or something . but , I can not figure out why neither of they will function , even though they be connect , accord to window . that be a bit of a hassle , have to re-install they , each time they be turn on . but , that be most likely a system problem w\/my laptop and not with the device . I have see comment that the sensitivity of the pad be not all that great , and I find it nearly equal to any mouse . a slight more effort , to get the cursor from one end of the screen to the other ... . if it be not for have to re-install everytime I turn the unit back on , I would have ZERO complaint ... ; - -rrb-
Keyboard	POS	4	I be concern when I order this keyboard that it be not original from Toshiba , but I buy it anyway because of the price . it fit perfectly , be easy to install and work perfectly . the only difference between the original one and this one -lrb- other than the `` l '' key quit on the old one -rrb- be that all the key on the new one be glossy . it really do not bother I , just want to let you know , just in case you care . great product , well package , and easy to install . -lrb- I find installation instruction on the net -rrb- . enjoy a keyboard with a `` l '' key finally .
Keyboard	POS	5	this be one of the few usb to PS\/2 adapter that work with Cybex \/ Avocent KVM switch without skip , multiple entry or lack of power draw from the keyboard PS\/2 input . the cable be thinner than the older version of the same model from IOgear but I have not see any degradation of performance .
Keyboard	POS	4	this work really great on my Mac Book . it be really necessary to prevent those white key from get dirty and to keep out crumbs\/dust . I type so much that six month later , the color on some of the most frequently use key be start to wear off , but it still work fine . it be not so much purple as it be bright pinkish-purple .
Keyboard	POS	4	for 96c and free shipping , this item be a steal ! the texture itself feel really soft and smooth . -lrb- personal preference -rrb- stick on the key , and doesnt slide off . almost Perfect fit . i only wish theyd cut out the white character so the keyboard back light would go pass through they .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I be typing on my new Kensington keyboard right now . it be just fine . the only problem for I be that it have no usb port . my fault for not look closer at the description . I just assume they all have usb nowadays . oh well .
Keyboard	POS	4	after check out the web site try to find out when this product would be available , it arrive ! what a cool look product ! it come in a neoprene case and have a metal look to it .  what I like the most about the product be input address and email . if I would of have this product when I first buy the old Palm pilot year ago , I would of save hour .  the only downside I see to the product be that it be not a `` durable '' keyboard . you have to have it on a flat , hard surface to use -lrb- not on you lap -rrb- . the w-fold do not lock once it be open , so make sure you keep it on a desk when you be use it and do not just pick it up with one hand like you can with you pc keyboard .  if you type memo , email or travel with you Palm , buy this product !
Keyboard	NEG	1	Logitech rep in BestBuy say that this unit would work with all hdtv that have a hdmus port . incorrect . you need to have a hdtv that have the circuitry to accept hdmus version 1.3 or higher .
Keyboard	POS	5	let I say this first of all . if you do not like noisy tactile keyboard this one be not for you . if you have use a IBM model m or one of the old Northgate keyboard you will love this keyboard . I have have computer since the old Heath kit and then buy a Northgate computer with the state of the art Intel processor - a 386dx and with the computer come a Northgate Omni keyboard . I love it . that all that ledt of that old system . Long toss but keep keyboard . the Model S Professional be the keyboard I purchase . it be the one with the letter key . they make one without letter so be sure of what you want . I have have it now for a couple of week now . it have the feedback that I like . you know when you press a key , you hear the key-press as well as feel the positive feedback . it seem to be very well make . it be not ergonomic as there be no wrist rest . it be not a media keyboard but I do not use those feature anyway . I have own a Logitech Wave and k350 keyboard and a Microsoft media keyboard -lrb- 6000 -rrb- . I just do not like the feedback from these membrane keyboard . oh yes it be a wire keyboard with a two port usb hub located on the side . to get the full benefit of the unlimited n-key rollover you need the old style ps2 port and in addition a usb port so that the usb hub on the keyboard will function . very expensive but well worth the price .
Keyboard	NEG	2	not satisfy . very difficult to pair . if you could , it disconnect in a minute . too small , key combination be difficult to use . no amazon , no return !
Keyboard	POS	5	I have be use the Logitech Combo mk520 with keyboard and Laser Mouse for a while now , and the operation be so seamless that I generally forget I be operate wireless at all . I have always use wire keyboard and mouse , and of course find the wire restrict - especially when I need to access the rear panel of my pc for any reason . my one previous experiment with a wireless mouse be short-lived , communication be inconsistent and eventually the software\/device crash . no problem here . setup be very smooth . although some prior reviewer note the keyboard touch be either better or worse than they be use to , personally I do not see any difference . I do not use many of the special key or feature . as note by many other , the calculator key be most handy and welcome . the music related function of mute , volume , next\/prior track all operate perfectly . I understand that the f1 - f12 key can be program to perform different function , but frankly I be not that interested . I use this equipment on my home pc , and for my purpose the additional programming be unnecessary . mouse operation be identical to my prior wire mouse . scroll be smooth . I do have to get use to the fact that if I accidentally knock my mouse to the right , since it be not physically connect to anything , it will indeed crash to the floor . it be a bit alarming for the klutzy , especially that one time the case pop up . but it be not overly delicate , and pop the case back down result in no harm , no foul . overall , this be simply a outstanding product in my experience . if anything , I have experience fewer problem with the Logitech wireless combo than I previously have with hardwired keyboard or mouse equipment .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I purchase this keyboard look for a cheap wireless keyboard and touchpad combo . at a distance of around 12-15 foot the response be ify . within range the device work well except for the most annoying thing about it . the device refresh every 30 seconds or so and this be especially irritating when try to watch a movie . it will also slightly move the cursor from time to time which make it worse . sometimes you get what you pay for .
Keyboard	NEU	3	my Targus Stowaway keyboard for Visor Deluxe seem to have die over the weekend after eighteen month . actually , it be a internal conflict within the Visor . I have add a jumper wire inside the Visor so I could charge from my hot synch . cradle after a corresponding modification to the cradle ... my stowaway keyboard work just like before after make this modification . then I download Targus ' lastest version of the driver for the keyboard . a couple of day later the keyboard be completely non-responsive . I have remove the jumper now . I later find the real problem be that my Visor be in its final stage of life . the keyboard do have a nasty habit of cease to communicate with my pda . by experimentation , I learn that a soft reset follow by a warm reset get it go again . the keyboard work well when it work , but too often it do not . again , this be probably more of a problem with the Visor than the keyboard .
Keyboard	NEG	1	this product do not work at all with my system . it do not lay flat , and be very difficult to type on . I have to write a lot for my job , and it be very difficult to use .
Keyboard	POS	5	then you need this keyboard ... take a little get use to but once you master it , you pain will go away over time . also keep other from use you keyboard !!! love this ergonomic product .
Keyboard	POS	5	I receive this product on November 5th 2011 . it be perfect ! it take 4 day to ship for free with super saver shipping . specification : 5.9 x 2.3 x .5 inch -lrb- l x w x h -rrb- , weight : 100g or .22 pound , operational range : 10 meter -lrb- for real ! -rrb- ! pro : small , good range -rrb- 10 ft , back-lit keyboard , small usb receiver that go into keyboard , look exactly like picture -lrb- have same button -rrb- , nearly all button find on laptop keyboard , come with usb splitter ; one side charger and other side female usb -lrb- genius -rrb- , button be easy to press , fair price -lrb- cheapest on internet -rrb- , laser pointer , and great bonus sleep feature . con : none . only thing be that this be make by favus entertainment if that somehow change you decision . if I ever need another wireless keyboard , this be the one I 'll buy for sure ! thanks , pjdsmt
Keyboard	POS	4	I buy this as a backup to my wireless keyboard . I do not want another old keyboard clutter my limited workspace , and this fit the bill . it always work when I need it , and when I do not ; I just roll it up and shove in the back of a desk drawer .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have to order a new keyboard after my original with my iMac succumb to the effect of a cup of coffee . the new one work great . I be very pleased with Apple product .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I brood on buy the virtually indestructible keyboard for several month . all the review I read tell I not to do it , but I do anyway . so why should not you buy this keyboard ? simply put , the key touch response be horrible . you can not fly over the key like you do with a normal keyboard , because they require a lot of pressure to input the letter you be typing . second , the key be lay out strangely . for instance , the spacebar be actually two key instead of one long , thin bar . so if you hit the middle of you spacebar by habit , you thumb will land in-between the two . also , the backspace button be the size of a normal letter key , which make it difficult to reach when touch typing . it be just very poorly design and not useful to anyone who type by touch . however , the illumination be pretty neat , and it do roll up as describe . I be hope it would work out for I so I could wipe it off when I spill a soda or drop a crumb in-between the key ... but this be not my solution , unfortunately . I can only recommend this keyboard to someone who be a `` hunt and peck '' kind of user , since they will probably be able to focus enough pressure on the key that the stiff input will not affect they typing style . for the speed typer , someone who use they computer nearly all day every day , stay far away .
Keyboard	POS	4	I have not use it as much as I could , but it have do exactly what I expect . I connect it to my vizio vtab108 easily . I type something on evernote and on dolphin browser . feel a bit weak but the key respond well .
Keyboard	POS	4	I recently purchase this mk320 wireless keyboard and mouse from Amazon . both be work great and catch the signal from good distance . I try from 5 foot and it be work fine . I would say consider this price -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- , this iteam be worth by .
Keyboard	POS	4	the keyboard sport slick design , unique functionality , and it be the most comfortable keyboard I have ever use -lrb- in 15 year of pc use -rrb- . it be a little buggy when use with a KVM though . it will take some get use to , but once you learn how to work with a ergonomic keyboard , you 'll have a hard time go back to a regular keypad . it be a must-have for my fellow carpel-tunnel survivor !
Keyboard	NEG	1	typical Microsoft nightmare . first the instruction for pair the keyboard to the computer do not clearly state you have to type the passkey number \*\* on the keyboard \*\*\* & PRESS ENTER to PAIR the keyboard with the computer . I spend hour try to get the keyboard to work . what throw I off be the first time I set it up , I do not have to type the passkey on the keyboard . the keyboard and computer drop the connection and when I try to re-install it would not pair with the computer . bring it back to Staples for a replacement . -lrb- too bad I do not find out until too late that my keyboard be function - it be the documentation which do not work . -rrb- get a new keyboard , get it to sync once , then it drop the connection and I could not get the keyboard to broadcast - keep push the bluetooth button to make the keyboard discoverable , but only get a green light and no flash red . then no green light at all . Staples be go to be sick of I try to return the new keyboard for the old one , but this be a disaster . look for a HP or Logitech bluetooth keyboard .
Keyboard	POS	4	although you should be able to use this keyboard with any computer , it be ideal for use with Thinkpad laptop . I have a Thinkpad x series . I spend almost half my time at location where I be directly work on the laptop 's keyboard . but other time , at home and at the office , I have a docking station and a external monitor . with that setup I use this keyboard . since the key placement be almost the same , it be very easy to switch between the laptop and the external keyboard ! however , one thing that I do not like be that although the key be shallow like laptop key , they do not feel the same . they be softer .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I usually do not bother write a review but for this specific item I feel like it be a duty to do it . I be one of those early adopter that buy anything new and never return they regardless of if they suck or not . I be very excite to get that brand spanking new Google tv but what a appointment it have be , the Google tv do not bring anything to the table period , it do not a little of every but very poorly . the build in web browser be useless since you can not install any plug in nor open a new tab , the keyboard do not have a light build in so forget try to use it in a dark room , the app ... well there be pretty much nonexistent , no storage space ... if you goal be to watch a bunch of movie and video on the internet you can just forget about it , the Google tv just will not find anything for you . it be a great idea but fail execution , use it for a week then return it .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have have my mouse and keyboard for about a year now , and so far , no problem . I still have the orginal battery in my keyboard . here be a little list of thing that I do not like about the keyboard and mouse : ... . . none . here be a list of what I like about this mouse and keyboard : ... ... . . everything .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I have order this item twice and neither time do I receive the item shown\/described !! instead of receive what you want you will in fact receive a crystal cover with no keyboard cover !!!
Keyboard	POS	5	I be just browse around to see what keyboard be available and I be surprise to see the trusty Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite still on the market . I have be use this keyboard every day for the past eight year and it have not fail I yet . what be especially great about this keyboard be its easy cleaning . after remove the 10-15 screw from the back of the keyboard , the key pop out in three section : left hand , right hand , and number pad . I scrub these with soapy water and a brush and rinse all debris away under the powerful spigot in my bathtub . I let the key section dry for a few hour and reassemble the keyboard . I have be do this every few month for eight year and I have yet to strip any screw or break anything . the last time I clean it , I use a little bit of rub alcohol to remove some of the palm oils which be embed into the plastic palm rest . this keyboard look as good as it do in 2002 , and none of the key have begin to show any wear either ! I have to agree with other reviewer that the arrow key layout be not the best . I remember use the prior model of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard about ten year ago , which have a better design with full-sized arrow key . I be consider order another one of these just to keep it in the closet in case the one I be use to type this review break , although I suspect that this one should last I 10-20 year give its current condition .
Keyboard	POS	5	wow ! I be a -lrb- girl -rrb- gamer and I have be want this for quite some time now and I be thrill . the key be so smooth ! typing be a breeze with this . I love that I can control my speaker with the wheel on the right side without have to go into sound setting or the volume control on the speaker themselves . it make it much easier when it be right there in front of you . I have yet to use the macro as I have be a bit too busy play game to be honest , but I plan to fill they all soon . it will be nice to not have to type all the information now that it be a simple press of a key . my profile disk would not work , but get the dl on Logitech 's web site be no problem . I have be miss out and really glad that I finally get this . it be more than worth the wait !
Keyboard	NEG	1	I like the concept of a keyboard that could dock my ipad2 , sync it , and charge it . too bad Apple do not make one compatible with the ipad 2 .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I do not like this product . the keyboard function do not work consistency . the pointer do not work .
Keyboard	NEG	1	before Gyration Inc. can compete in the Mouse & Keyboard arena , they must learn to design product that be completely in sync with Windows ! I even take extra step in download all driver need from the Gyration Website , but this slick and very design drive package still could not give a `` Ultra Performance '' . the keyboard would sometimes read and sometimes not ... and the mouse would force Windows to crash ! it be too bad , I want it to work . I guess I should stick to the `` Old School Products '' with more experience .
Keyboard	POS	4	I like this keyboard a lot it work well and even though I do not think I would use the extra programmable key I do sometimes . the problem be that I sometimes hit the Back and forward key when it would be better not to . mostly it be my fault but I think the could have be place better . the last Microsoft Natural keyboard I have have a screw up arrow keypad and that be why I buy this one to replace it . I be use to the standard keyboard configuration . I like this keyboard because it be standard for the most part with a few extra . this time they do not change the basic setup they just add to it .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I pick this set up because I want a second one of the keyboard -lrb- which I love , see my review  Logitech k350 2.4 Ghz Wireless Keyboard  ... not . the mouse be full-sized and full-featured . very flexible with the software as far as reprogram the button . however , there be two feature of this mouse that will cause I to either put it in a drawer for emergency replacement or just give it away . 1 . the scroll wheel : I have two other Logitech mouse that I use most of the time : a MX Revolution and a Darkfield Performance MX . both have very fast scroll wheel . once you get use to that , you never want to go back . this mouse be painfully slow in comparison , and , although via the software you can reprogram it to two other scroll mode , both require move the mouse on the desktop rather than just move the scroll wheel . 2 . this be the real deal-breaker : the finish on the top of the mouse be gritty and irritate my palm . I use this mouse for about 4 hour , do normal `` stuff . '' my right hand be back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse , but mostly I be click around the web and my system . at the end of the time , the palm of my hand , in the quadrant under my pinky and toward the heel , be irritated . I could not figure out why . then I compare the finish on the m510 to my other two and realize that the other be MUCH smoother . I check my husband 's stash of sandpaper , and I would say that the m510 have a finish on the top that be just a bit smoother that 600 grit wet or dry sandpaper . apparently I do not settle my hand all the way down on the body of the mouse all the time . part of my hand hover just high enough that it `` brush '' over the surface of the mouse . I never realize that before , but now that I know , I 'll never buy a mouse without a smooth top surface again . if you mousing technique be different from mine , this could be a great mouse for you , but not for I .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I buy this from clearance monster use . it arrive with a note inside state there be no battery and no manual but it do not illuminate so I be highly disappoint ; ok I understand it be use but the paper work inside never say anything about it not work and I feel you folk rip I off besides the fact that when it arrive the inside of the box and some of the contents look like it be throw around and not properly pack NOT HAPPY that I still need to turn on a light at night and be the sole purpose of buying .
Keyboard	POS	5	the first one I receive be doa so I get a refund and order another one . I have have the replacement for about three week and it be great ! the keyboard charge within a couple of hour and it use the apple 30-pin connector so it be very convenient in that respect . I have not do a rigorous battery test on the key but I have use they for a couple of hour straight without a hitch . the key go into sleep mode after a couple minute to save battery and reconect in a second as soon as you strike a key . it conveniently have a switch on the side so when you do not need it you can just turn in off . it have all the key like a regular keyboard . the right shift key be a little weird to hit as well as the delete key , they both take a bit of get use to but not too bad , other than that it be a relatively nice keyboard to type on . I be write the whole review with it . there be also a whole set of very useful function key at the top such as brightne , home button , search , select all , copy , paste , cut , play pause , next track , previous track , volume up and down , mute , and lock . the keyboard be hold on by pretty strong magnet and can be remove if not need . the case be synthetic leather and it feel nice , it have a loop to hold a stylus below where the home button go . the inside surface of the case have a suede feeling . all of the opening for button , mic , speaker and camera be well place and easily accesible . the be one mod I have to do however ; the flap that hold the ipad in place start get some play and the ipad gigle around a bit and I get nervous about it fall out , specially after read a review that it have happen to somebody so I get some velcro with the sticky back and put it on oposite side of where the flap meet the case and problem solve , my ipad be securely in place and I can take it out easily if I need to . with the couple of flaw it have the price more than make up for it , and at $ 35 you can not go wrong and get a great keyboard case for all of you that need to type while on the go .
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy this keyboard\/mouse combo because I need a way to play my computer game that be display via hdmus to my big screen tv . this combo have a huge reach and I have never have a issue with the signal be drop or laggy . I buy these somewhere around 5 month ago and the original battery be still display as full with pretty heavy daily use . never see a mouse like this one , do not have the typical red laser eye for tracking , have no light at all actually , but it literately work on anything include my jeans . Logitech do it again , I be weary of spend this kind of cash on a keyboard and mouse , but I be very happy I do .
Keyboard	NEU	3	I love everything about this keyboard except for one problem when i be typing , at anormal speed , it type a million of eaaaaach letter , like this , i do not od that with the a be in each , the keyboard do . its really annoying , especially when it also go for the backspace . mean that if I be at the end of `` each '' and want to fix those a 's i would press backspace and my enitre sentence would be delete . besides that its great its also constantly behind , by like a full second
Keyboard	POS	5	I buy the Saitek Eclipse II Keyboard as a upgrade from a smaller illuminating keyboard . I really like the feature on this . it be well lay out and very well build . it be get a nice weight and feel to it . the key feel great while typing and actually have a little bit of texture to they . even the character on the key have style . I especially like the glossy black finish to the main board part . the illumination be not terribly bright , but it be enough to find the key in the dark and make it look cool . the color can be change with the press of a button and the intensity of the light can also be adjust . it do not come with direction , but everything be pretty easy to figure out . great keyboard !
Keyboard	NEG	1	the '' \ '' key be located somewhere very uncomfortable -lrb- below `` enter '' -rrb- . as I do a lot of programming and need to type the key pretty often , it be just a painful to use the keyboard . I regret I have not examine the layout of key carefully before purchase it .
Keyboard	POS	4	you can not beat the price on this keyboard skin . I like that it protect the keyboard - it add a barrier from liquid get into my laptop in case of accidental spill , and keep dust and lint from get in between the key . it feel good with its nice rubbery grip , but it do take a little bit of get use to . con : it do not fit perfectly snug so there be a few area on the edge that slightly buckle . the rubbery feel take get use to so at first you typing will slow down because it feel like each key be stick -lrb- even though it be not -rrb- . you can not tell if the cap lock be turn on because it cover the little light . overall I recommend this skin and I actually end up buy another one for my daughter too .
Keyboard	POS	5	I have read up a lot on the black widow from Razer , and I be honestly not so sure I want to buy it after all the bad review and the forum post that people keep say they be have issue with the keyboard , but eventually I choose to take the risk , I mean Amazon have a amazing return policy so if something go wrong I could always return it . anyways the keyboard arrive quickly and I have be use it for roughly a month or two and so far have have none of the problem post by a lot of user . the back light be perfect for work in low light , and I 'll admit the key do clack a little loudly but its not really a problem for I . as other people have mention , yes the font be a little weird at first but it really be not hard to get use to it , or the swap of the number and alternate symbol on they . all in all a very good product that have spoil I , as I refuse to use anything but mechanical anymore !
Keyboard	POS	5	great product and love use it ! I have have it for about 2 month and have not have any technical problem with it .
Keyboard	POS	4	I like this keyboard a lot . it be on a little expensive side , but I think it be worth all the money in term of comfortness . if you be familiar with the layout of a natural keyboard , and if you do not need look down every time you type , you will love the comfortness of this keyboard like myself . the soft padding and the reverse tilting -lrb- bottom side of the keyboard be lift with the stand include -rrb- seem to give I extra mileage every time I use this keyboard . since the last one I use be a Microsoft Bluetooth Elite , it would not be fair for I to rate the responsiveness of this keyboard . I be not a gamer , but I could not stand the jumpy sleep\/wake mechanism of the bluetooth keyboard -lrb- otherwise Bluetooth Elite be a very solid product ... stylish , too -rrb- . finally I decide to go back to a wire one , and I do not seem to have the problem any more . if you be , however , a sniper typist , one-shot-one-type , I see a small problem . with the reverse tilting , probably you will find yourself do extra neck workout , reach out you head to look down every time you type . also if you be not fully familiar with the natural keyboard layout , probably you will sometimes have to look down and you will find that you finger block you view to the letter on the key with the stand attach . sure you can use this keyboard without the stand , but then probably you can find a alternative choice ... something even cheaper maybe ... the keyboard layout be what you can expect from any natural keyboard . however , the extra function key -lrb- favorite , sound on\/off etc. -rrb- layout do not seem quite intuitive , and icon on those key be hard to recognize . as a personal opinion , I wish those icon illuminate for better recognition , if they have to have low contrast against the luminance of the key . there go my 5 star keyboard .
Keyboard	POS	4	the keyboard work excellent all around , the only thing you should be aware of be that some of the non word key be closer to the word than normal keyboard be
Keyboard	POS	4	once you use a color backlighted keyboard you 'll never like any other . if you like to be online in a dark room , it be the best ! the Saitek Eclipse keyboard be durable , survive multiple drop onto hard floor . but the key can become blur as paint wear off . also , the Zippy backlit offer more color combination , more control and be prettier . the Zippy be shiny , piano black with flatter , quieter , more responsive key . the Zippy be more compact , which not everyone will want , but which better suit I . compare for value and feature . I have own 3 Saiteks , but love the Zippy more . zippy bl-741 usb V. 2.0 512 Color Gradation Illuminated Backlight Keyboard be available on Amazon for $ 44.99 + $ 5.99 shipping .
Keyboard	POS	5	this cable be very simple to use and be about $ 45.00 less than the name brand model that do exactly the same thing .
Keyboard	NEU	3	this cover be not a great fit for my keyboard , but it do stay put once you have type on it a bit . it take awhile to get use to , but now that I be , it really have speed up my typing and protect my key from get dirty . it be easy to pop it off and clean it , but then of course it be weird to fit it back on . however , I try typing without it the other day , and it be a very odd feeling , so I guess I have get use to it . the main reason I feel it speed up typing be because you finger will not slide around the key , and with the extra friction you do not have to be as precise . the reason for my rating of 3 be that the blue be considerably lighter than it appear in this picture - much closer to sky blue than to true blue . I would have return it but do not want to deal with the hassle .
Keyboard	POS	5	pro : key have excellent feel and the program key make fly Microsoft FSX much easier con : blacklighting could be a litle brighter on the high setting but still very adequate for fly at night with only ilumination from the monitor ' purchase for the blacklighting and programable key feature and have not disappoint . keyboard dimension w\/o wrist rest 21.5 w x 8.5 deep . I have to re-adjust my pull out plastic keyboard tray to accodomate the depth . my old keyboard be 6.0 deep and I need the new one to clear the desk overhang to allow access to the very top control . I rarely use the top control and could have leave the old tray in its original position . the back lighting be blue and have 2 brightness level along with off and the adjustment key be above the f-12 function key . the wrist rest be easily detach and since I do not type other than email I have not install it as the additional depth would have add another 2-3 inch . it be a great gaming keyboard especially for Flight Sim use
Keyboard	POS	5	work great !! go the best buy way and have to return asap as they key board have a range of 3 foot this unit work great up to 30 foot away from laptop hook to plasma tv
Keyboard	NEG	2	some the key be in wierd place and backspace button be small rather than rectangle a little hard to get use to
Keyboard	POS	5	I read some of the negative review and I be hesitant , but I seem to have get lucky because mine have no problem and this keyboard be amazing . none of my key be touch each other like some older review complain of , and the feel of the keyboard be perfect . I love the feel and the sound of each key click as a I compress it . the speed of my typing instantly rise a substantial amount , while the error I typically make have be reduce . I have use this for typing papers , programming , and gaming . it be great for all three . my reaction time for gaming have increase due to the short actuation point of the mechanical key and I be typing faster and more comfortably when work on homework . I highly recommend this product to anybody consider the purchase - it be completely worth the money . though I would recommend wait for a Friday when Amazon do electronic deal because the keyboard often drop below $ 110 then .
Keyboard	NEG	1	I recently purchase the Logitech Media Keyboard . the numeric key on the right side of keyboard do not work . it come with almost no write instruction -lrb- I would have be satisfy with something print on the box -rrb- . Logitech help do not offer 24 hour \/ seven day a week support . -lrb- they must not have pay they Indian & Russian phone bill ! -rrb- the key imprint look like they be put on with whiteout and they must have be try to save money because they be at least 1\/64th of a inch long . the CIA should buy  Logitech 967740-0403 Internet 350 Vista Qualified Usb Keyboard - black  altogether a complete waste of money and perfectly good cheap plastic !
Video_Games	POS	5	there isnt much I can really say about this series that hasnt be say to death but ill be the first to tell you , they be right . the sheer scope and size of the game and its contents be just mind blow with ton of thing to do while you be not try to finish the story . . you could easily put 30 hour into the main story and a amazing number of side mission and minus game to do , and the new social system be great as well which allow you to `` hang out '' with certain character from the story which can benefit you as the story progress depend on who be cool with you and who hate you Main game 5 out of 5 . lose and damned Ill admit im nowhere near finish with it but imagine they take regular gta4 , give you new interior location , new character , car , and even radio station then throw in the attitude and kick arseness of son of Anarchy and you have L&D; . and last but I assume not least be the ballad of gay Tony , havent even touch this one yet and ill be honest with the pure length of the main game + l&d; it might be a while before I get to tony . . all in all its a solid production where Rockstar didnt cut any corner at all , top notch voice act , well think out minus game that dont feel like a grind , i could go on and on about the great stuff in this game but I wont however , I do have one last bit of information . it have multiplayer with up to 16 in some of the most insane action and chase outside of a Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer film , wanna know more quit be cheap and buy this package , i pay 20 for it last month and I wouldnt be unhappy if I pay a full 59.99 +1
Video_Games	POS	5	I be a avid fan of Nintendo . still , I feel the release of the 3d be a bit rush . the launch game be lack , be mostly remake or gimmicky game try to show off the capability of the new system . with this game however , Nintendo hit the sweet spot . they have make a truly amazing game on they revolutionary new console . the platform feel spot on , with game play from 2d and 3d Mario game . if I have to describe it , I would say it be 2.5 d , if that make any sense . it be like a 2d platformer , but instead of have just a foreground to play in , you play in multiple foreground and background . this game have tanookus fever . there be tanookus goomba , tanooki bullet bill , tanookus bowser , and of course , tanookus Mario . defeat goomba with my tail be something I have not do since Mario 3 . this game be HUGE . in order to have a 5 star file you have to complete all level , get all the star coin , complete all level as Luigi , get to the top of every flagpole , and get to the top of every flagpole as Luigi . con : the tanookus suit make thing almost too easy , it almost feel like cheating . in the last couple of level be hard in a bad way . they only give you 30 seconds to complete they , with clock scatter over the level that give you 10 extra seconds . and they use Shadow clone , shadowy Mario doppleganger that follow you every move , damage you if they touch you . it make I feel as if I be run out of a building that be go to explode with a gunman chasing after I . overall , the good outweigh the bad , give you no reason to pass up on this game .
Video_Games	POS	5	we purchase Epic Mickey for we 10 year old son for Christmas . he be a avid gamer and have play through almost all of the Mario game , as well as a few Link game , so we be very surprised to see we son have such a difficult time with the game . the reason why he be have a hard time with it be not because it be difficult to control - on the contrary , it be very easy . it be because it be the type of game where you really need to take you time . epic Mickey be not a `` rush through and finish it out to win it '' game , but be , rather , truly a epic adventure . you get to be Mickey in a entirely new -lrb- or old , depend on how you look at it -rrb- world , where he need not only to save himself , but to help many other . the game change depend on how you play it . if you help out a lot of people , for instance , they 'll be there to lend you a hand when you may need it . or you can skip help other and can just rush through the game yourself , but if you do this the game be a bit more difficult . pro - the control . you get to run around and paint and thin thing . how much fun be that ? grant you can not paint or thin everything , but there be a large number of thing that you can paint and thin , and what you choose to do change the way the land around you look , truly personalize the game . - the sheer size of it . it be huge . it be a game where you can run all over the place and still not see everything , much like Disney World itself . - the sentiment . we just get back from Disney and see some of the same thing , like `` mean '' street and the Disney statue , be so sentimental for I . and watch Mickey 's animated face when he see Walt 's statue - priceless ! con - the camera control - you do not have full , complete camera control like you do in some game , and I can see where that would be frustrate to some people . to I , however , it be just another challenge to the game , and it do not bother I too badly . epic Mickey be a great game - not the easiest game , but definitely great . it actually get emotion out of I whenever one of the character be unremembered by Mickey , and when they talk about be forget about by the world . any video game that can not only challenge you and intrigue you , but also make you feel emotion , be a good one to I .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I have enjoy all the other game but the folk on this line be correct ... it be terrible . I spend six hour try different way to configure it to work without success . the character sometimes move and cast spell and then they just stand there . I have a friend who also have it and have the same problem . since they make the money I be sure they do not care , but this game be something that should be replace with something that work . this will be the last one that I buy and I be over 60 but young at heart .
Video_Games	POS	4	my daughter and I be huge Broadway fan and really enjoy play just Dance so we be eagerly await Dance on Broadway . at first , I be a bit offput by the relatively bad rating compare to just Dance . I think this be because it be a different kind of dancing . instead of the frenetic movement of just Dance , most of these song be a lot slower and require more measure and control movement . also , the game be not as sensitive and have a less refined score system . as for the graphic , there be not any trouble for we to see the dance . the outfit be also kind of cute on the avatar , and it be a welcome change . I also think it be a pretty good aerobic workout if you be willing to move you foot and actually follow the dance ! if you do not move you foot , yes , you will probably will not get as intense a workout as you would with just Dance . 4\/5 because you always want more song .
Video_Games	POS	5	I buy this for my 5 and 7 year old girl , and we have 5 boy between 4 and 8 at we house and all of they love this game . very fun and aerobic , and all the adult love it too . I recommend it ! Great for family night !
Video_Games	POS	4	try to control the plane with you computer keyboard can be very difficult . other than that the game be totally awesome . all though I think they make the flight control a little more flimsy which can account for make it hard to control some of the plane in the game . even with these setback , I love Microsoft Flight Sim 2004 . the detail be more realistic than other version of the Flight Simulator . I take off from the Salt Lake City international airport and actually manage to land a 737 on the landing strip in Las Vegas . the 737 be my favorite plane because once you up in the air , you can put the plane into autopilot and sit to enjoy the view . have read the flight manual for the Boeing 737 , I can say that all the control be right where they suppose to on the plane . I also like to set the weather to thunderstorm . I find it more interesting to see lighting storm go on under I when I be 35,000 foot up ! if you look into take fly lesson this game will defiantly reminder you , there be a lot more to fly than just get the plane up in the air . Flight Simulator 2004 will give you a sure opportunity to fine tune you fly skill .
Video_Games	POS	5	first let I just say that I be very bias towards MGS , its my favorite series . also I buy my PS3 at launch for this game alone , but still I have to say that this be the close to perfection than any other video game in history . first let start with the greatest part of mss4 , the story , simply put , it answer every question a fan could ask . its one of the greatest story of any media . next the graphic , true they be some game with better graphic , but the environment and everything go together perfectly . the sound in this game be unbeleiveable , its so realistic , and the soundtrack can rival the Halo series . finally game play , this be probably the most satisfying game I every play , epic boss fight to the in game battle that rage on the battle field , its so awesome . in my opinion if you have a PS3 than you owe it to yourself to play this game , and if you do not go to a friend -lrb- or make a friend -rrb- with a PS3 .
Video_Games	POS	5	if you be go to buy a Dreamcast , you should probably make this you first game . very fun and fast gameplay , and interesting storyline . you explore in huge area call adventure stage to find action sage , where you destroy enemy and complete one of the three objective . the first one ussually be to get to the end of the stage , second , do that with 50 ring usually , and third , complete the stage in the time limit . this , of course , be as Sonic . there be 5 other character to unlock along the way with different objective for the stage . also , there be a virtual pet part that you can feed they and do other thing , then put the on you memory unit to play with separately . this provide hour of fun . the graphic in this game be stunning , and the music be awesome and set the mood in the stage . this be a great game .
Video_Games	NEU	3	this game be great in many respects . it be a follow up to Mount & Blade , what I feel be the best medieval mount fight semi-rpg of all time . that say , it be a lot to live up to . Mount & Blade Warband fall short of the original and have a lot of bug -lrb- lot ! -rrb- . it appear the developer tweak the game in favor of multiplayer mode and fail to deliver on the single player aspect , forget to expand on the rpg element and to make the world believable . if you be into multiplayer , you be in for a treat . if not , then you may want to wait until the price drop down to $ 9.99 or until more patch be release to fix the bug , or the mod community have have a chance to release some interesting work to play . some of the notable bug I be see : \* - random rainbow artifact with the graphic when roam around the tavern \* - random graphic glitching during combat \* - nerfing of the couch lance ; it be nearly impossible now to be a lancer \* - nerfing of archer ; it be near impossible to hit anyone with a bow or crossbow , even when aim for expose body part , especially when you be on horseback \* - a bug where if you repeatedly re-assign the marshall role to any other lord under you , you relationship with the other increase ridiculously dramatically \* - after a battle , the battle summary that come up be miss the name of the soldier that die or be wound all in all , this game be not ready for prime time . I think it should have be in beta much longer . fortunately , Taleworlds be great at release fix and patch for customer . if you do make the mistake of buy it early and find the problem too annoying , hang on to you copy until the problem be fix or until the modding community have complete a few mod . this be easily the best modding game out there .
Video_Games	POS	5	the game be fun . pure and simple . the bunny be amusing and the fly dragon take concentration and work . the ice slide be outstanding and , again , take patience . if the game be too easy , people would complain ... if it be too hard ... people will complain . bottom line be - you can not please they all . but the way they make the character switch be a good , solidly easy play . I be look forward to the next one . great job , guy & girl .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I be 14 year old . it be kind of embarass that I could not get past the second level in a Rugrats kid game . I 'll keep try , but for now I would not reccomend this game .
Video_Games	NEG	1	in many respects this sim be inferior to fs2004 . the frame rate be terrible and the aircraft viewpoint too fussy to get to quickly . anyone with fs2004 and with good add on scenery I would advise to stay with it . my computer be state of the art with dual core pcu , Nvidea 7900GT graphic . over New York in fs2004 with all slider max out I get over 35 fp , with FSX I get 7 fp . with slider at normal and a slide show . I have since uninstalled my FSX and return to fs2004 .

Video_Games	POS	5	amazing , even more than amazing . since I buy it I enjoy play COD till max . I use to hate to play free for all but now its a pleasure . just get ninja pro . I recommend you to try it .
Video_Games	NEU	3	this be a amazing game , up until the point where software bug prevent the player -lrb- i.e. I -rrb- from continue the adventure . therefore , since only about 2\/3rds of the game be available for I to play I rate it no greater than 2\/3rds of the maximum . I 'll just mention the bug without use any spoiler . you 'll eventually encounter a cavern that you must enter and do something , but if you save after enter this cavern and then restart a confirm glitch in the game will prevent you from ever leave . I be incredibly disgusted with this situation and be not yet do deal with Nintendo because they solution be to start over from scratch or from a earlier save record if one be available . if I have it to do over again I would wait for a second release of this game , like a `` Player 's Choice '' release because it be likely that will contain a update build of the game with bug fix . you may also want to consider the Gamecube build because I have read account where people say that the bug be fix for the Gamecube release . this situation and other that I recently have have with Nintendo product have seriously dent the reputation for quality that the company use to have .
Video_Games	POS	5	well , first I buy the Sims Deluxe with 1 expansion and that get old after a while but now that I have this with all the expansion I dont know if it could get boring . there be so much to do now like adopt pet and go downtown . the possibility be endless !

Video_Games	POS	5	great game . graphic : the graphic have greatly improve since the original Halo . the bump-mapping have do a great deal for the game . throw a plasma grenade on the ground and watch the lighting effect . 10\/10 SOUND : I love the sound in this game , great music , and great sound effect . my only complaint be that the warthog sound less `` scary '' and the smg sound more like fully-auto cap gun instead of real gun . but other than that the sound be great . 9.7 \/ 10 gameplay : fun ! I love the new addition of dual weilding . I also like the way that you can board and enemy vehicle . these be just a couple of the many thing that have greatly add to the already fun gameplay of HALO . 10\/10 story -lrb- no spoiler -rrb- : good story . there have be many complaint about the end ... but I think the story be very immersive . I love it . although the end be slightly dissapointing . 9.8 \/ 10 MULTIPLAYER : in Halo this be one of the main attraction . in Halo 2 multiplayer could have make a game . its incredibly fun and addicting . now with the new addition of live you can play with new or old friend while on completely different continent . Multiplayer be what help make this game what it be ... a great game . 10\/10 VALUE : Definatly a game that will keep you occupy for year . 10\/10 OVERALL : Halo 2 leave I completely breathless ... well , it leave I with enough breath to say `` damn ! '' score :9.9
Video_Games	POS	5	Thise game have no perpose at all but it be addictive . you can play for hour try to get money to pay off debt or get cool furnture . this game be a must have for any gamecube . without it no gamecube pack be complete .
Video_Games	POS	4	this product be great for get the full flight experience . if turn up the weather scenery and graphic airport weather and the water look almost as high quality as flight simulator x. the only thing that I be bume about be no concord !!! . I think that if its go to say 100 year of flight the concord should be in there . the plane selection be very good though with plane rangee from the wright flyer to the boeing 747 400 also lot of airline to choose from ! . tip go to denver new tokyo airport narita I think and princess julianna international airport those be some high detail airport . overall this be a very good product .
Video_Games	NEU	3	fable be a game that aim way too high and have no chance of do anything but come up short of gamer ' expectation . yes , it be a good game . yes , it be worth playing . no , it be probably not worth buying , nor be it as deep and realistic as its creator profess . the game be short . I beat it in 12 hour and that include a fair amount of screw around . this be unacceptable consider it be developer claim that fable would be the greatest rpg ever make . the game be easy . if you be good at videogame , you will find this game easy . they say you can `` boast '' to make you mission harder , and while this can make indiviual mission tougher , it be not enough to make the overall game experience more difficult . the good\/evil idea be a good \* idea \* . implement it in a way that be satisfy to the player have yet to be achieve by any game and it would appear we have a long way to go . ca not really blame the developer for try but the morality element be painfully two-dimensional . the action be good . combat be fun and addictive . there be a good amount of skill and powerup to choose from when spend you experience , but again , the extremely short length of the game make all you careful experience spending feel waste . the story blow . take a stereotype fairytale and take away a few hour and you have fable 's story . the game be novel at first . it trick you . but as you play more you see that , at best , fable be a good action\/adventure game : not the ultimate good\/evil rpg that some have hope for . Rent it .
Video_Games	POS	5	I know every one be try to move away from wire controller , but I have to tell you , own this one be just too cool . I use it almost constantly , and , in the spirit of `` Tron '' I use it the entire time I be play the game . the controller be of the quality one would expect from XBox , and the light make a great conversation piece when you friend come over for game day . as for the game `` Tron : Legacy '' , well ... I would give it a 8 out of 10 . although I will be leave a review of the game when I purchase it , -lrb- I use Gamefly for my rental -rrb- I will leave some quick feedback here as well . the graphic be awesome , the control be simple enough to master , and the puzzle be engage , and yes , sometimes even a little frustrating . the most glaring fault with the game be all the jump . thankfully , fall to you death do not set you back to badly . although some of the jump be a aggravation when try to master they . and those be only the one that require flawless execution . as a long time fan of `` Tron '' and the original arcade game -lrb- which I would own if I could find one -rrb- I find that the new movie and corresponding game stay true to the spirit of the original movie . one of the few game I have find that do not suck after see the movie , and the controller just add to the legacy . a must have for collector !
Video_Games	NEU	3	pro , it be a great product by Microsoft . the sensor be amazing . however , it might not be suitable for small apartment . and also xbox do not play blueray
Video_Games	POS	4	absolutely love this game !! I do not know why people complain about the wiimote and nunchuck , because I think they be quite compatible as controller . the graffic be terrific as be the storyline , and if you be not use cheat , the game be just difficult enough to keep you interested , but not so difficult that it drive you nut and you give up , and chuck the wiimote at you poor hdtv . I really love the little village ; they be so quaint and charming -lrb- you have guess it ; I be a chick -rrb- ! the only thing that I dislike about the game be the end : you can not go back and free-play after the grand finale . -lrb- I be hope to return to the cute little village and make Link & Zelda `` create '' little sword-and-shield-yielding baby ! ; -rrb- ha ! -rrb- unfortunately , this kind of end be typical of Zelda game . why oh why ???

Video_Games	POS	5	I must say , I spend a good two month decide on what headphone to buy for my xbox360 . I finally decide on the Turtle Beach x41 . I be concern about feedback , interference , crackle , and every other thing people complain about in other review . I have experience nothing but crystal clear 5.1 surround sound . I have have the headset for a few week now . I do not know if it have improve my gaming in black op , it be a bit overwhelming at first . hearing every bullet , bug in the air , music playing be a amazing . I actually think I be experience feedback on Grid in Black op ... but it be simply the fact that my team spawn in domination next to the power station . the buzz be something I have never hear before even with my surround sound speaker . I have the receiver set right on top of my 360 with 1st generation wireless network adapter , a wireless router , and my iMac run use airport in the next room . still no feedback or interference , even use Comcast and they crazy throttling . one complaint be that the chat volume control take some fiddle to get the right volume set . first time I use it I be blow away at how loud my friend be . overall , very pleased with this purchase . so be my wife ... she do not have to hear the announcer say my killstreak over and over !
Video_Games	POS	5	word can not express how incredible this game be ! I want to start this review by come in with a bit of a background on myself . I first get into elder scroll when I hear about skyrim be release in 2011 when it be 2010 . honestly , it look great . so I pick up oblivion because I think that would give I a idea . now many may disagree with I . but I be not too impressed with oblivion . I have some fun , but I be scare a lot from explore , and the main quest with the oblivion gate be terrifying . I put in many 10 hour into that game before I call it quit . so when skyrim first come out . I wait just a bit to hear about . I be then fortunate enough to get it as a Christmas gift and even the first scene just blow I away . for return fan , this have -lrb- for I at least -rrb- every aspect of oblivion that I do like , and everything else be near perfection . this game be the most true to a rpg theme than any other . from the start you can truly do whatever you want , whenever you , however you want , as whoever you want . the race create a great mix of culture and dispute , with different benefit and like to you character . the universe be immense and you completely fall into this beautiful world of conflict and distress . the most amazing thing . if you pick up this game , you have just pick up at least 50 hour of entertainment . over the course of 3-4 month . I have play over 100 hour of this game . it be mind blowing . how be a game capable of such a defeat ? the quest be great , and you do not even have to do the main quest if you do not want , and the guild quest will be just as intense and lengthy as the main quest , so you have plenty of fun . every skill be improve base off how you use it . be you into stealth ? sneak around , pick lock and pocket and you will get better as you go . more of a brute ? collect heavy armor and some strong weapon and take the enemy 's head on and become the strongest man\/woman in skyrim . it have a adaptional feature , so it really customize the game to you liking . and you can even build you own weapon and armor with the smithing skill . and for the first time magic be as strong as the other lifestyle . so you can finally live as a mage if you like magic . and learn at a college ! it be phenomenal ! if you a fan of medival castle age or fantasy , you could not ask for a better game . it be simplly perfect . on a scale to 1-10 I would give it a 9.8 and the only reason it be not perfect , be because there be a few bug . I have not experience as many as there supposedly be . but I can not ignore they , and for that reason it be not a perfect ten . but it be as close as one can get . it be a very open world game , and rumor have it that a expansion pack like dlc be to come soon that may even open up the old word of morrowind or cyrodill -lrb- previously release title in the series with a new gen touch -rrb- which I be unbelievably excite for . I can not stress enough how amazing this game be . even if it do not sound like you kind of game because of violence or quest , just try it , and see for yourself , because you want be able to drop it once you try it !
Video_Games	POS	4	the game be fun . there be no doubt about that . it probably appeal to the younger audience , hence the e rating . I find it to be clever . it follow the storyline of the movie but be able to deviate in appropriate way . for example when Buzz be navigate through a room , it may switch to he fly through space . it be as if he be get play with , use a child 's imagination just like the movie . the game incorporate the touch pad intermittently so there be a good mix of the control . you can unlock level for free play by collect the pixar ball . my biggest criticism be that it be not challenging , but I think it be appropriate for the younger gamer . by add the free play , it be good for replay value .
Video_Games	POS	4	if you go to a U.S. elementary school in the ninety , chance be you play this game . this version be exactly how I remember the old game from my grade school day . hard work and creative design reward you with success in the game . Poor design and poor planning lead to failure . and let not forget that if you get bore , you can build roller coaster to no where that send people fly to they explosive death . could this game be any greater for a grade school kid ? play this game year later be entertaining , even addictive . the objective of the game usually revolve around obtain a certain park rating and a certain number of guest . often time , these objective can be complete with a lot of time to spare , and it can be pretty bore to just sit around wait out the clock . one thing that be sometimes annoying about this game be that you must use the CD while play the game . this would not be a big deal , but sometimes as you be play the game , you will start scroll to another part of a game level and the game will momentarily freeze . it will freeze for 5 seconds or so while the CD spin up and provide the necessary information . I wish the CD rom would just load all of the necessary file onto my hard drive so I would not have to deal with delay . but it be a minor issue , and the game be still enjoyable . for some add fun , you can look up cheat for the game online . many of they involve re-naming guest in the amusement park and they will do certain thing , include wave , painting , take picture , etc. . some cheat will even make the go-kart drive faster . if you be look for a game to take you back to you younger day or you simply want to instill the capitalistic value in you child\/spouse\/video game play pet Roller Coaster Tycoon be the way to go .

Video_Games	POS	5	this game be one my favorite . the graphic and detail be good and quite entertaining . it seem that the game be innitially create with younger people in mind , but I be 22 and I enjoy play . it start out easier at the begin like most game and gradually get more challenging as you work up the higher level . there be some level which still kick my butt -- I be ashamed to admit . what I like about it be there be a lot of free range adventure where Spyro be able to roam about seek out hidden treasure and place . not everything you look for be readily obvious . I would recommend this game for anybody who like adventure and level type fantasy game without all the blood and gut . it be also a really great game for kid as there be no profanity or anything of the like involve .
Video_Games	POS	5	great game , great support from Blizzard in get it to run on my new IMac .

Video_Games	POS	5	roller coaster tycoon be a game that you build you own theme park . it might look boring , but once you start play it , it be very fun and creative . this game 's get lot 's of cool ride like corkscrew rollercoaster , inverted coaster , swine ship and gravitron and more . and there be lot of mild ride and shop like car ride , space ring , gift shop and pizza . this game be creative be because you can almost do what you want to do in this game . for example , you can make a vertical loop go through a vertical loop when you build a rollercoaster . but there be also some problem . you have only two kind of objective in this and that be makeing guest come two you park and increase park vaule . this might make the game boring but you have to accomplish these objective in different park situation . like you have lot trash in you park or something like that . I give this game 5 star because it , s very creative and with a little imagination you can build a park that even you be go to be suprised !

Video_Games	POS	5	very fun game . I buy it for my nephew and he love it . of course , he have to have the 2nd one now .
Video_Games	POS	5	the best adventure\/puzzle game I have ever play . the graphic be state-of-the-art and the story line be very original and most intriguing . the puzzle be challenge enough to make you think , but lack the frustration I have encounter with other game . it be a nice relaxing game with the appeal of a great novel , except I get tire of Dan and Olivia -lrb- two minor character -rrb- . I agree with some of the other review that the end be slightly abrupt . I want to see a full-size automaton mammoth . hopefully there will be a sequel continue Kate 's journey .
Video_Games	POS	4	I buy this , it work great for literally 20 minute , then it stop work . manage to get it work again after mess around with the driver and now it work perfectly fine . for the hassle I go through to make it work , its worth the price , you just might have to play with it a bit to get it work .
Video_Games	NEG	1	I could not wait to buy this game , but now I be go to . the DRM be reprehensible and I will not purchase until it be go .
Video_Games	POS	5	this version do not use the nunchuk . yay ! I have give up on game that use the nunchuk so this be a great change . the workout be vigorous , and there be some new fun activity that make you forget how much you be squat and jump . I agree with other who say that it be irritating that the remote and balance board lose contact and have to be turn back on even though they be not use for most activity .
Video_Games	NEG	1	when I first play this game at my friend 's house , I be astounded by the magnificent graphic and gameplay . WOW -- be unlike any other video game I have ever play in my life . I just admire the Worgen so much that I quickly become obsess with interest ; however , I keep wonder why my friend would pay ninety-five dollar and a fifteen dollar fee each month for Cataclysm . so week pass by after New year day and that be when I discover a advirtisement of the game from Amazon . I check the video , picture etc. . I soon realize that my interest be short live , when I learn that I would have to pay for all four game as a whole -lrb- just for the one game -rrb- . not to mention the fifteen dollar monthly fee for a battle.net account . the entire expansion set have a staggering , one-hundred dollar price tag . that be not all . if you do not have the right computer , it will cost you one-thousand buck or more for a Mac ! as a blizzard consumer I would suggest that you try they free 10 day trial offer , pick out one you favorite character and make it jump off a cliff ... why ? because it make absolutely no sense to pay for something so expensive . I be very disappointed and unsatisfied . no offense ; I apologize . but as a reasonable gamer I choose to not buy this game until the price be fair . this item be obviously more of a luxury than a game that be why I give up on purchase it .
Video_Games	POS	5	i have the original gta4 at first , but when i see this go on sale , i decide to splurge as well as use my promotional credit from before to grab this at a steal -lrb- around $ 16 -rrb- . even if it be at full price i would have still be happy come with gta4 , the lose and the damned , and the ballad of gay Tony , all on the one disc . the only trouble i can see be that each section need to be install on the PS3 . overall though , a great package .
Video_Games	NEG	2	I pick this up instead of the new medal of honor . the guy at Gamestop say it blow away mw2 and the new MOH . oh how wrong be he . First off , I be a very big campaign player . I play online sometimes when I get bore , but mostly I be into the campaign . mw2 's story line be far better than this one , yeah the campaign be cool and have its twist and turn but it be sub par in my opinion . I have see much better . graphic be good , but not great , a couple new weapon and feature be add that help out some . I be not go to spoil anything in the story for those of you who want to try it . online play be typical COD , more like WAW than MW though . it really would have be nice to see they do something longer and stop concentrate so much on the online ply . i understand that be where the money be at , but some people like both world . the only nice addition be the extra zombie game option , but its just like World at War game play wise so if you have WAW , save you money . instead of spending so much money on advertising this game with Kobe and Jimmy , they should have put it into the game . I can not believe I buy this . I be head to Gamestop now to trade in this so call great first person shooter . long story short , I should have buy medal of honor .
Video_Games	POS	5	this computer game have a such a wonderful environment to explore ! I wish there be more of it ! the 3-d animated character be a nice improvement over the 2-d animation in `` secret can kill '' . the puzzle be fun , and the game play be addictive . this game be a little bit tougher than the last game ... you really have to hunt for those clue . `` Stay Tuned '' be perfect for anyone who love a good mystery . it be a refreshing alternative to the blood , gore and evil in the popular software game today . I highly recommend it .
Video_Games	POS	5	I purchase another controller think it charge two of the normal PS3 controller and two move controlelr -- but it only charge one move and one nav controller . this one will charge 4 of any combination of move or nav controller . I also believe it hold they better than my other controller , provide positive feedback as to the charge status -lrb- and when it be do -rrb- and have a power button -lrb- my other one do not and thus be always drain electricity -rrb- .
Video_Games	POS	5	when Bungie announce that they be make Halo 2 , a lot of people think that they be just fix up the original one and add thing . Bungie then inform the public that it be build it all over again and this be much more than just a re-make . the game design and control be identical to the original , while the graphic be bump up a few notch . the texture take a few seconds to load sometimes mid cut-scene , but it be a improvement . you can definately tell the same people design the level in this game that do the last , as there be one or two that be pretty redundant and stretch probably longer than they need to . but overall , this game have many new thing to offer . First off , duel weilding weapon . you can still only store one weapon that you be not use , but the current one , if it be hold by one hand , can leave room for you to pick up another one handed weapon . in this case , you can fire both simultaniously or in whatever combination you want -lrb- alternate and such -rrb- because you right trigger control you right weapon , and leave trigger now control the left one -lrb- as oppose to the grenade , like normal -rrb- . this add much to the game on its own . second , you have a plethora of new weapon to play with . the covenant arsenal have be expand exponentially , and you can now wield the energy sword -lrb- a new favorite , as you could imagine -rrb- . you also get the fuel rod projector , which be the big gun that be graft onto the arm of the hunter - the covenant equivalent to the rocket launcher . it have a covenant equivalent to a sniper rifle , and a carbine also . Third , you can hi-jack vehicle . this be a major plus , but definately a skill to be learn and master . this will make multiplayer much more interesting . also , you can climb on enemy tank , pop the cover open , and drop a grenade in there to cook the pilot without waste a rocket like you have to before . fourth , the story be much more complex . there be more cutscene , and another goodie that be leave out of the previous review -lrb- or at least the one I have read -rrb- . while the story do not flow nearly as easily as the last game , there be essentially two story happen simultaneously . I be guess the story will combine later -lrb- I be only halfway through now -rrb- , but beside the one with the Master Chief , you play the Arbitor in the other . you be the disgraced elite that be in charge of the fleet in the first game . you failure to bring the Master Chief down and preserve the Halo have bring you much pain , and the suicidal position of the Arbitor . you play alongside the Covenant military as he , and run mission against Covenant rebel and other thing . this give much exposure into how the Covenant work and develop they much more so than the last game . two variation to the original classic weapon must be note . the pistol do not have a scope on it anymore , which will definately balance multiplayer game by limit those head-shot guru who never fight up close . also , the previous Assault Rifle , with its automatic fire and 60 round magazine be long go . in its place be the battle Rifle , with a 2x scope , but only a three round burst fire mode , and a 32 shoot magazine . sadly enough , take elite out with that be much harder because you can not bum-rush they while empty you magazine . the three round burst definetly slow down the effectiveness of the rifle in short range combat , which be probably why they introduce the sub machine gun , which be a high rate of fire , caseless , one handed weapon . of course , now you have to have both of they for the same advantage you have with the single Assault Rifle before , but it be a minor setback . I do not have access to XBOX Live where I be at currently , but I be sure this will be one of the greatest live experience to date . I know how much fun the orinigal game be in multiplayer , so this one , with its improvement , will be much better . all in all , the developer have make a game with the same addictive attribute of Halo , but with much more replayability , mass multiplayer option , and enough improvement to fill a football stadium . all of the other fpss I have will have to take a backseat to this . there be just nothing that can compete .
Video_Games	POS	5	this game be unlike the other . it be a lot more fun and interesting ! you start out in a train where all the student have something to say . you be already battle monster and explore the train . after that you start lesson and you get to be all the character ! you do so many thing and a lot of it you can do over and over . so buy the game , pleasant encounter await you !

Video_Games	POS	5	this be a great color gaming system that broght the fun of most of the game of sega 's genisis to a pocket version . the color graphic blow away any of it be competition at the time -lrb- except for the 16bit atarus lynx system , highly overlook -rrb- , and should have lay waiste to the gameboy , except for the marketing and pricing . it be tough to believe that the survivor from this time period be the gameboy . this be family friendly , still readily available and with many title in most use gaming store . very well worth look at and buy for younger kid that may not be ready for a psp . this have a few more maturer game for the pre-teens as well , so they can continue to devlop they interest beyond bubble bobble and kirby -lrb- even though bubble bobble be excellet , a classic -rrb- . Worth look at .

Video_Games	POS	5	the PSP be limit by have only one analog stick , and psp user know when play FPS game it become so frustrating . this game instead be a third person shooter , basically overhead , and the creator make this game as fun as it could be on the psp . you aim and shoot with the analog , you get grenade , a lot of weapon , after mission you be reward base on you performance and uncover of veteran money , basically you use this to buy more cool weapon . there be plenty of weapon , feature , mission and they include a update to bring another act with several mission as a free bonus , plus they include a update for free online play . a great package and a great psp game with a entertaining story line , fun game play and rich graphic .
Video_Games	NEU	3	my 3 kid realy enjoy each of they d 's one be buy new and two use . it be very addictive . one thing I would caustion parent about the d 's they break but not like you think . my daughter 's break on the second day she have owend it . we buy it use , so we have no idea how old it be and of course no warrenty by manufacture . my daughter give it to I to set the time and such . I do so shut it and then want to ck something open it again -lrb- this be with out sit it down -rrb- and as I open it the d 's hing crack . I do some reserch and find this be very common . so if you child hing break do not get mad at you child it be a failur flaw of the d it be self . I also strongly advise you spend the money for a screen protecter as they do get scratch up . they be fun but i feel they price be to high for they qulity . I hope this info help you in desige just how much you willing to spend for one . most game be $ 35 , - they go up to $ 50 , - but you can get they cheaper if you by use . beware of copy best way to avoid they be to buy from US seller only . please do not hold this info aginst Amazon or the seller on amazon i buy from , this be nentendo flaw not theirs .
Video_Games	POS	5	this and the final scene be my favorite . it be exciting , not too hard , not too terribly easy and a lot of surprise . Execept when you gotta find those damn bug I love every minute of it . no stupid puzzle -lrb- \* cough Blackmoor \* cough -rrb-
Video_Games	POS	4	excellent product . actually save a battery I be have problem with before . my battery refuse to charge , but with this , it get it right back to charge -lrb- the charge cable could have be bad , not sure -rrb- . it be small , take little space , and charge battery within hour . Great little product for the price .
Video_Games	NEU	3	as any metal Gear fan will tell you , the story and the way it be tell be just as important as anything in this game . and as the final chapter in solid Snake 's legacy , it function as the wrap up of all aspect of the story leave behind for about 20 year . and that be it be problem . after about 25 hour of sit back and listen to explanation that seem to be push into logic , I be not satisfy with my investment . it seem that the more I advance into the game , the less I play and even know how MGS game play out , I be still surprise at how little time I be get to actually have fun . I will not argue about production value or graphic and sound . this game look and sound above all else on the PS3 . but as a game , as something I would like to interact with and be a active participant in , it just do not fulfill my need .
Video_Games	POS	4	this third party battery be a perfect fit in all four of we wireless controller as well as the Microsoft fast charger . recharge time and length of useable time be similar to that of the Microsoft battery . while some reviewer have complain about battery that do not fit , I have to question why they do not send they back at that time . Amazon will exchange a defective product with free return shipping . at one third the cost of the Microsoft brand battery , these be a bargain .
Video_Games	POS	5	I would say this look good ; it seem to be add a firework show feautre , and a major game downfall be no show outside of the cinema . it should be good .
Video_Games	NEG	1	the DRM be insane . I can not even install the game to play on separate account on the same computer . they need to offer a family pack or something similar . I do not mind ` rent ' a game if the DRM scheme be reasonable but what be use for spore make it very family unfriendly .
Video_Games	POS	4	sadly , I have no broadband . therefore , i can not enjo what be probably the best part of this game . however , I have play the campaign , and i can tell you it be a little disapointing . the plot be dumb , and the charactor be thin . through out the entire game , the only threat to you be enemy mech , which pop up more often later , but during the begining it be just point and shoot . the strong point of this game be in the control scheme and the enviornment . almost everything be destroyable , form building to stone pillar and the local fauna . overall , i would only give this game 3 star . but i be allow for benefit of the doubt with the multiplayer thing , and give it 4 .
Video_Games	NEU	3	DaGeDar be a game where you control a DaGeDar steel ball and have it roll through a course . it actually remind I of Sonic the hedgehog with how you control the ball through loop and as you pass through item . you can receive Energy Chargers that refill you Turbo meter so you can go at turbo speed and fly through the air from a cannon . there be other boost and of course patch to slow you down or even eat up you ball so you have to start over . the game include 3 Championship Leagues , 7Zones , and 100 DaGeDar ball to unlock . you have to keep playing -lrb- racing -rrb- to get better speed and slowly you will unlock more and more of the game . so while the game be very easy to play , the challenge be to keep play to unlock more level and ball and get better time . my 3 year old love this game , that be how easy it be for he - now of course he have a horrible time and be not use Turbo or anything , but he be able to beat the level . for older kid it be the challenge of unlock everything and even compete against friend ! we only have one d otherwise I be sure my boy would love to race each other ! oh and the basic level and option you have in the beginning be okay but they definitely get cooler as the game go on !
Video_Games	POS	5	this have the control and proper feel of a xbox controller and I use this for my pc . I like not have to worry about battery . have a long cord that be the right length . a excellent purchase for a pc gamer like myself who do not need a controller all the time .

Video_Games	NEU	3	these controller be great but some require some work . I have bough 3 . 1 come perfect out of the box . 1 I have to open and realign the dpad and one of the shoulder button . 1 the right shoulder board be smaller than the place for it so I hot glue it into place . these work excellent but the manufacturing leave something to be desire .
Video_Games	POS	5	I have not play a battlefield game since bf2 on the pc . I have switch over to the call of duty series over the last few year and love they . I read some of the glowing review for bf3 and decide to give it a shot and have not be disappoint . I recommend download the hd graphic -lrb- which clock in at around 2gb -rrb- . they be great and they make you feel more immerse in you surroundings . I know people have complain about it take up hdd space , but there be only so much you can fit on a dvd . if you have the 250gb console , this should not be a problem . my only complaint with the game be : 1 - you can not customize you class in between round . I find this annoying because I end up adjust my kit during time I should be play in a round . be it the end of the world , no. . it be something that can be fix though . 2 - not be able jump out of the server you be currently on while in between round . at the end of a round you have to wait until the next round begin before you can quit you current server to join a new one . it take about a minute or so to switch in between map . again a minor complaint but one that can be fix in the future I be sure . I try go back to mw3 but find the run & gun pace a bit play out . I like the `` slower '' pace of bf3 , as well as the xp point bonus -lrb- like give ammo to or reviving\/healing -rrb- you get from interact with you assign squadmate -lrb- if you join one -rrb- . the destructible environment bring another level of play in . tank & rocket can take out wall , car & tree . finally , the weapon customization rock in this game . so many option to choose from . from tactical flashlight , bipod , IR scope to foregrip & underbarrel launcher . this be a must own title !
Video_Games	POS	5	first time play both these game , I enjoy they very much . GOW I be simply amazing with Pandora 's temple . very well do . GOW II be a great game but loose some of the luster that GOW I have . however , GOW II do prepare you for the highly anticipate gowiius -lrb- which I can not wait for -rrb- . either way , this be a steal . two great , great game at a reasonable price . enjoy .
Video_Games	NEG	2	I receive this game as a gift and find it to be time consuming but not that great . First off , you have to go back to board you have already be to like a hundred time , which really eat my patience ... secondly it be a bit vague as to which way i be suppose to go and how to get there . it be ok if you like a loooonnng game , but i be more of the super mario brother type ...
Video_Games	NEU	3	the game might be worth 4 star out of 5 . for most people it be probably great . let 's start with the UI . it be okay . not great but okay . the kinect really kind require different menu 's than something like the Wii - option have to be bigger and they should not be close to each other since it be way to easy to select something wrong with it if they be . and the icon need to be self explanatory . unfortunately this program do not follow those guideline very well . the UI be perfectly serviceable after you get use to it , do not get I wrong ... but be ready to select a lot of thing wrong until then use the Kinect . onto the workout . they be not too bad . I be okay with they and I be certain that the person that this title be aim at will be very tired when get do with a session . on the other hand I have be do daily workout with the Wii Fit for three year , ea Sports active for about 1.5 year and the gym for a year . I be not in that category and so I barely sweat ... at least as far as the program have go so far - it may very well get harder as I go . on the other hand , I love the tech - the body scan be useful . and the ability to control the program as you be work out with you voice be just plain cool . the program offer good feedback as you work out that be appropriate to the movement you be make . so for the right person this be a 4\/5 star . for I it be a 3\/5 .
Video_Games	POS	5	this game be go to be so cool because I love the other Roller Coaster Tycoon game . I wish you could be a customer in somebody 's park and you could pick on what ride you want to go on and then ride they . but I be glad this game be come out becuase I will be play it all day ! it will rock !
Video_Games	POS	4	as a electronically inclined college student who do review for store that sell this console , own one , and can actually afford to keep it interesting , I can tell you this much . the ps2 be a very advanced -lrb- consumer wise -rrb- gaming system that can keep the right person amuse for several hour . it do a little more than the other gaming system -lrb- for instance , it be dvd ready , play the game of it be predecessor , have both exensive brand name and not so expensive generic addition , and have a bigger and possibly better reputation -rrb- .  it also tend to get costly , as do the other system . my point here be that while you can certainly just buy one of these system -lrb- ps2 , gamecube , xbox ... or even the new gameboy -rrb- you should make note of the other option . for example : most of these system will run for about the same amount . however , there be downside .  the ps2 be dvd ready and the game ... well , there be more than you can shake a stick at . and if you buy they at the right time the price do not allow for buyer 's remorse . in this particular case I would have to say that if you have play with the original playstation and still have the game then the system be worth the cost .  however Nintendo fan should know that the Gamecube have the right competative edge to go up against the ps2 . it be light , the game be on minidisc , the graphic be plenty better than the n64 , and the controller be pretty much a game player dream come true . yet the game be slightly limited and still a bit expensive .  as for the xbox , I do not know all that much . I think I get too tired of microsoft computer game to bother purchase a separate console to play with . it be dvd ready like the ps2 . it have internal memory and networking capability and like I say I be a electronics kinda person . I just find it strange that I can buy a computer game for say $ 40 or I can purchase a gaome console for the same price that I pay for the ps2 and then go buy the game for that instead .  as a odd little end note : I think that the Xbox 's controller be a tad awkward . it be rather like a morph version of a ps2 and Gamecube controller . after say 25 minute of play a game on it you hand might start to feel quite exhaust . the reason may have something to do with the overall shape . like I say ... morph version .
Video_Games	POS	5	this be a great product that my 4 year old son love . he really like car , especially race car . this product have a number of fun and educational activity to do before Putt Putt can enter the race . my son love the race at the end , but he never rush through the activity , because he have such a good time do they as well . he particularly like have to go to the garden maze and find different fruit and veggy .

Video_Games	POS	5	we play this game yesterday at a friend 's house with a group of 5 kid who range in age from 3-12 . they all have a great time and burn off a lot of energy ! the gameplay be easy , the team play mode be great , and the kid have lot of silly fun . it be my first time play one of the just Dance game , and I will definitely be purchase the other just Dance game for I and my older kid , because we would prefer the song by the real artist . for people with younger kid , this game be fantastic fun .
Video_Games	POS	5	awesome , lot of content , great game , come with stand and 6 ar card . this game provide you with hour of diverse gameplay . at the beginning of each level you get to fit then you attack on the ground . you get to fuse weapon . this be the best 3d game ever !
Video_Games	NEG	1	I be excite to get this unit so that I would not have to always change out which system I have hook up in my little office on my little tv . the system work great , mostly . although I do notice some glitch , it be good enough to say that it be justify in price . good thing there be controller port for each system that work , because the include wireless one simply do not work . neither of they . at all . period . I be pretty tick off about that as it show they have no quality control whatsoever . I decide to return it and try again hope I get a work set . I might come back and post a follow up if the next set works\/doesn ' t work .
Video_Games	POS	4	I get this game on the first day . I be so excited since i love the first one -lrb- except for the final drive mission -rrb- . it be gameplaywise it have really evolve , which be a good thing . you can now jack the covenant vehicle with `` right timing '' . also they get rid of the health meter , another good thing . all in all i love it . but that doa not mean it be perfect . Let 's move on ahead to the `` not so good '' part . there be a lot of glitch in the fmv sequence of the game . some object pop in & out . and , `` why would i wanna play as a arbiter ? '' . that part totally bum I out .
Video_Games	POS	5	I love this game ! ice Cap be REALLY cool , along with Twinkle Park . when you enter Twinkle Park , you have to get in a bumper car and drive down a long but fun road . it have ton of loop and hairpin curve ... drool . and the ending of Ice Cap be cool , where you have to snowboard down the mountain to avoid a avalanche and then skid down and grab the Emerald on you way . the Storyline : Sonic be return to Station Square after a long journey and run across a liquid monster name Chaos . you have to fight he , and he turn into a puddle and slip down the sewer . then he be at the beach and see tail in he new plane , out of control . you have to get through Emerald Coast to save he . tail show Sonic a Purple Chaos Emerald -lrb- if they be emerald , why be just the Ice Cap one green ? O. o -rrb- and tell he it be the power source of he new plane . then he tell Sonic to meet he at he shop in the Mystic ruin . sonic arrive , but he be stop by Robotnik and have to fight he . I forget the rest , but at one point you have to fight Knuckles . when you be Amy , the end be pretty sad : e-102 die and the bird 's family fly away with the bird .  Chao : the Chao , also know as a-life , be little blue and green coo thing that remind many sonic fan of Tamagotchi . you have to feed they and let they sleep . you 'll notice that when you attack a enemy in a Action Stage , a animal inside a green bubble float out . grab the animal , and when you go to the Chao Garden the animal you collect will fly out . hold one up to a Chao and after glowing green , it 'll get a characteristic of the animal . only animal that have spark fly from they do this , though . if you give you Chao enough animal , -lrb- 20 once , 50 the second time . -rrb- it 'll sit down and form a white cocoon around it . the cocoon will fade and the Chao will look different and be a different color . if you Chao be limp or if you hurt it a lot , it will make a cocoon and die .  so , all in all , this game rule !
Video_Games	POS	4	battlefield 3 be a great game , but not without its shortcoming . First off , the campaign . in the beginning , I be originally concern that it be copy black op , but as other have say , this i impossible because black op be release about a year ago . the only thing battlefield 3 have in common be that the main character 's be interrogate and the campaign go through flashback mission . there be nothing else in common . the mission be fun , and it be all a plausible scenario , give the state of Iran right now . campaign be not solid , but it be not extremely bad . Multiplayer be , however , the strong suite . there be massive map , destructible building , and vehicle aplenty . the ranking system go a little quickly if you play too much but that be not a bad thing . Tactical flashlight be extremely frustrating , though , as a warning . there be unfortunately people online who camp and use other n00bish tactic , but do not worry about they , explosive always take care of those annoying failure . the serve be mostly fine , though ea and dice charge people who buy use copy of the game , which can be annoying to those who frequent Gamestop . it lag sometimes , though this can be forgive , see as how gigantic the map be . there be not a large selection of map , and play a lot make they get old , though not as fast as one may think . back to karkand release in December , so we 'll all be wait .
Video_Games	NEG	1	get a refund , as have many other . have nothing but problem with this game , and be very disappointed . I do not think they could ever fix all the bug and glitch in it if they try ! nothing like Dungeon siege 1 or 2 .
Video_Games	POS	4	I really love this game , but it feel too much like # 2 , they really do not improve a whole lot and the story be very similar . I think I actually like # 2 more so . I would say get it if you love the series , but do not be too impressed .
Video_Games	POS	5	the doom name have always be synonymous with fp -lrb- first person shooter -rrb- , so I be always amaze at how long it take ID to come out with a new iteration of the game with enhance play and graphic . let I just say that this game be worth the wait . the graphic be flawless , right down to the character 's arm hair . you can actually see realistic look dimple and razor scarring on the npc face ! I be get ahead of myself . the premise be rather straightforward . all hell break loose -lrb- no pun intend -rrb- on a top secret Martian research facility , and you character have be give the duty to set thing right . the monster be fierce and agile . the weapon be deadly . the environment be beyond spooky . my suggestion be to play this game at night with the light off and the speaker crank , and believe I , it will scare the living daylight out of you . all the weapon from the original doom be back , and look quite impressive , especially the bfg-9000 . a few extra have be add , such as hand grenade and the Soul cube . yes it can be a pain sometimes because you can not carry a flashlight and fire at the same time , force you to do without any light during critical firefight , but in my opinion that add to the horror and difficulty factor . creature aus be not that great , but let I tell you that these monster be much tougher than you remember from the original . imp can suddenly jump and strike you from 30 foot away , or even drop down from the ceiling behind you . the spider swarm you from every direction . the lose soul charge you at amazing speed from multiple direction . the gameplay can get repetetive quickly , but you heart be beat way too fast for you to even notice . with superb graphic , eery sound effect , and good playability , I say this game be a must have for any fp fan . FYI , the game run smoothly on my pc at 1024x768 at high detail with this setup : AMD Athlon xp 3000 + , 128MB Radeon 9600 pro , 1.5 gb RAM , 2x120 GB SATA strip raid .

I would go as far to say the most fun part of the game be the cell stage . f for effort !
Video_Games	POS	5	Video gaming be one of my favorite activity to do in the lazy time of the day . I be a console stud by heart and have a deep love for the console game . it be for that very reason I be very skeptical work with a video game that only work via a mouse and keyboard . worst of all there be just so many people daily who seem to spam the hell out of other like I say '' get use to it , it be way better ! '' and while this could be consider with game that require keyboard and mouse use such as final fantasy\/etc when it come to game like first person shooter , you learn to grow a deep hate for the w , s , a , and d key . not to mention in the heat of the matter who want to reach halfway across they keyboard to tap r to reload , or hit u to talk , or n to switch weapon ?! I be a shooter by heart and game like Team Fortress 2 , leave 4 dead , Borderlands and call of duty it take much more than just skill master a keyboard . you break you finger on the pad and lose a lot of esteem work that way if you be not into it . it be why that when I have recieve this controller for say game I be in heaven . I have spend week attempt to master the game and even as I have grow use to they the fact have remain I be not a pc gamer . with the mad Catz xbox controller I feel like I have the control again and the edge . most of all I have a one up factor over even the console controller : a smoother compact feel , a more sensitive grip , and full access control map to give I the comfort on which button I feel better with . I will say I be deeply skeptical over get a controller for the pc just as much as play on it . for all I know I be get a piece of junk and that worried I . I be glad to say I have it all wrong and in the end I now have another new console to work with that will provide I another full year of entertainment . : -rrb- a few thing I should mention however about the controller that be not specify be that this be not a exact replica of the 360 's version . this be design to be more compact and the control to remain tighter as a group . the layout be design , in my opinion at the very least , more forward for quicker response and certain button be redesign larger for use of ease such as the left and right bumper . the biggest thing I should mention be the leave and right trigger which be make in a hook like mannor that when tap feel so much greater than the 360 version . the bonus side to all of this be that it do not just stop on the pc though . this controller can also work on you very console provide the same awesome control . a word of advice however to user who be play Team Fortress 2 : in order to gain the full function of you controller you must enter you option menu , go under the keyboard section , go into advanced option and click '' enable developer console '' upon return to the menu press the wave key '' ` '' and then enter on the command `` exec 360controller '' without the '' '' at which point you controller will auto tune to the original control feature on the 360 . for all other game the control easily adjust and can be tune . : -rrb-

I be very impress by this game and glad I buy it . a great experience for any hockey fan !
Video_Games	POS	5	the multiplayer be really addictive . my first real foray into multiplayer . the single player feel like a on rail sort of game which kinda stink . I officially go full-on nerd and get a gaming headset for this game . it be so much fun . the update map be terrific . probably my favorite game thus far . ca not recommend this game enough . it be challenging but with some patient and weapon upgrade you 'll unlock the full potential for maximum fun . I love this game .
Video_Games	POS	5	I recently get this game for my 2 girl , age 5 and 3 , and it be one of they absolute favorite ! they love the `` strike up the band '' song at the beginning and have it memorize . they love choose outfit , groom the animal , and decorate the float . they ask to play this game all the time !

Video_Games	NEG	1	I buy a sharpshooter , a mini controller -lrb- whatever they be call -rrb- really only to play with this game . they do not work . at all . so , 2 star off for that . at least with kz3 you can fully customize how the move \/ sharpshooter work , with this -lrb- as far as what happen when you hit the iron sight button -rrb- you just can not . and it do not work . in short , do not even consider use this with a sharpshooter . I have really try to make it work , but no luck . once you hit the ironsight -lrb- zoom -rrb- button , forgehdaboudit . also , this be a completely different game than Res 1 and 2 . and , the problem be , that I really like resistance 1 and 2 . the two player split screen be horrible . it split you tv in half horizontally -lrb- the opposite of Res 1 -rrb- and it just come off feeling cramp . very uncomfortable . res1 work perfectly , no clue why they feel the need to change it . also -lrb- spoiler ? -rrb- : -rrb- let I ruin the game for you : every scene go like this . where be we suppose to go ? ahhh ! TOO MANY MONSTERS ! ! ! ! they be all dead ? ok . . where do I go next ? whereas Res 1 and 2 have you choose cover and take enemy out with headshot -lrb- my style -rrb- this be MONSTER MONSTER BUM RUSH BUM rush constantly . some people might call it `` intense '' . . I call it `` overwhelming-to-the-point-of-constant-frustration . '' -lrb- really ? I get hit by the 10 monster behind I because I be shoot the 20 monster in front of I ? yeah . . that be fair ! -rrb- : -rrb- my son and I be try to get through it , but tonight even he say . . `` wow , this game just be not very good , be it . . '' so , 1 star off for . . not match up to the joy that be 1 and 2 . finally , 1 more star off for this : the swearing . I know it be not for kid , neither be 1 or 2 . . but there be -lrb- comparably -rrb- very little swearing in 1 and 2 . plus , 1 and 2 be so good you could `` forgive '' it here and there . . this be not a very good game and it be back up by a annoying sound track of cuss word for no reason . Boo . so , here end another 1 star review . keep in mind I purchase many other product and game and be quite happy with they -lrb- and usually do not review they as there be enough positive review out there for you to read and help in you decision make . -rrb- I tend to only post review when I feel that the other side really need to be say in case you be try to make a purchase decision . in this case , I would highly recommend a rent or wait until you can get it use for 30 , especially if you be not into multiplayer like I . mho .

New course be a lot of fun and cgus characte be a exciting challenge in the 150cc race .
Video_Games	NEG	1	this be the first and will be the last securom product I 'll ever buy . the game start off good enough , but eventually just become tedious and pointless . give it to the local thrift shop while there be still a activation or two leave .

AlarmClock	NEU	3	I own my previous Westclox Travelmate for more than 12 year . it be the only alarm clock I own - or need . very reliable & accurate - for most of those year . it begin to go screwy only the last couple of year I have it . so I replace it with another Travelmate , just a couple of month ago . at first I be very pleased with my purchase , but this one be already exhibit the bug of the first Travelmate - almost right out of the gate . the time setting and alarm setting often change - spontaneously and mysteriously - all by themselves , sometimes several time during the same day ! since the problem have not go away , and since I can not depend upon it to process time accurately -lrb- a core requirement for a alarm clock , would not you say ? -rrb- , I have decide to replace it with something better . since it cost only a few buck , it simply be not a good use of my time to go through the hassle and expense of return it for a refund .

AlarmClock	NEG	2	Didnot keep this clock , be not what I want ... cheap clock with too many knob for my taste ...
AlarmClock	NEG	2	love how this clock look . but it do not keep time ... every week or so its behind twenty minute so I would not use it for alarm purpose . I be consider rebuy another one hope that one will keep time because I be attach to how it look in my little girl nursery . and yes , I have change the battery many time to no avail .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this clock be great for shift worker . another reviewer mention that tap the snooze button more than once multiply the user define snooze time by the number of tap . that be a nice surprise that I do not read about in the instruction booklet . the battery backup be nice in the event of a power outage . however , my old clock would keep track of the time internally and still sound the alarm -lrb- even the radio -rrb- at the correct time with no ac power apply . this clock save its setting but will not wake you if the power be off when you alarm should sound . as be mention in another review , the backup battery holder be cheap and oddly support . this force I to re-enter the setting the first time I move the clock . a wire on the holder must have be over the battery contact . I bent it away and it seem to retain the setting now . there be room for improvement but this be the first of its kind and it do what I need it to do . maybe the upcome `` Executive '' model will address some of these thing . regardless , I be happy with it .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a very nice little clock , especially for the price . I have no trouble get it to pick up a signal when initially set it up , and it have have no problem hold onto a signal wherever I have it in my house . I have not really have any trouble with any of the thing the other reviewer have note , except for one , and it be a pretty major flaw : the clock beep -lrb- loudly -rrb- every time you press a button . this include the button you use to turn on the light in the middle of the night , which I never use since it would disturb my husband . I decide not to return it because it meet my need for a travel clock\/alarm , and I really like that it be a atomic clock . I find it easy to check the alarm time setting , and have not have any issue with accidentally change the time zone .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have have this clock for just a couple of day but I be extremely impressed . I place it on the dresser in my bedroom and it be easily readable . I have have projection clock and these end up in the trash over time because the projection fade or become fuzzy - and I have have several - but this new clock without projection be the cat 's meow ! I feel that I need to see the time when I awake in the night and this clock have not disappointed I - the number be huge , clear and just perfect . the battery backup take a 9 volt and it be easily install . the packaging be not too much -lrb- I hate those form fitting one you have to slice you finger up to open -rrb- - this packaging be clear plastic but pop right off . needless to say I be very pleased and highly recommend this clock .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a awesome figurine . however , the snooze only go off for 2 minute , and if during that time you do not hit the snooze it will not go off again . the clock do not light up so you can see it in the dark , you have to push on the head to make it light up for a minute . so it be not a very good alarm , unless you set another one for back up .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I want a alarm clock to wake I up with something other than beep or a radio . I try the Sony ICFC707 clock radio which have more sophisticated programming than this clock . but the Sony have only 5 sound , all of which be too innocuous to penetrate my sleep mind . this clock 's designer include some sound for people like I who want a soothing sound to wake they up -lrb- I use the wind chime setting -rrb- . all in all , I miss the Sony 's programming , which include the 5 day programming . also with the Sony , you can choose different sound and volume level for each alarm and sleep function . this clock , as far as I know , have the same volume across the board . also , like other reviewer say , the increment between the volume setting -lrb- from vol 1 to vol level 2 -rrb- be just too wide . some of the sound be pretty hard to distinguish from each other , -lrb- ebb tide , oceanside & surf up , for example -rrb- so I be a bit unsure why they even bother to include they separately . the wind chime loop seem very short ; for wake up , it be just fine , for go to sleep , it might drive some people batty . pro : pleasant sound to wake up to which you can control the volume level con : somewhat unsophisticated programming -- one volume for all , no 5\/2 day alarm choice
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have have 3 of these clock over the past 15 year . my 2nd one just die after several hard year of use ... travel literally around the world multiple time . be sooo happy to find a new one on Amazon . this clock be the perfect size -lrb- smaller than a business card -rrb- , it light up with the press of the big `` light '' button , and it be easy to change the time & alarm . and it do not make unwanted beeping noise every time you want to press a button . they have be very durable and ... best of all ... it slide very easily into a briefcase or shave kit bag . it be perfect for the business traveler !
AlarmClock	POS	4	this clock have some cool feature . the bell be somewhat loud , but the flash light usually wake I up first . and I love it be look , with a couple of exception . as a designer , I be bother by the transparency of the left side of the clock , especially when my bedside table lamp be illuminate . also , the light for the clock face have a orange-colored hot spot by the ' 3 ' . I be not sure why that be , and if it be all of they or just mine . maybe I be be too picky ... I try to imagine that the original clock have these same defect , and try to love the clock anyway .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock be excellent for a bare bone digital clock . when I first plug it in , the time be less than one second off atomic time . I have plug and unplug the clock many time the past 6 month and the time be now about 26 seconds faster than actual time . the time and calendar can be manually adjust -- read the manual . the Daylight Saving Time can be disabled for portion of the U.S. which do not observe DST . the DST setting can be set to the new DST rule or old DST rule in the unlikely event Congress decide to go back to the old rule . by default , the clock be set to the new DST rule . in case of power failure , the display will turn off , but the clock will still run and the alarm will sound if the alarm be activate . the clock use 4 lr44 battery as backup . the manual say the battery last 3 year before need replacement . when change the battery , leave the clock plug in . this way , you will not need to manually reset the time and calendar . the downside to this clock be the blinking colon '' : '' and the display be bright . there be no dimmer switch .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	it be so small it do not bother I at all . if light really really bother you this may work . it be a lot of money for very little product . I now have a biobrite with white noise . I wish the BioBrite have a radio instead of a beep backup , but I be not asleep by then anyway since the light have wake I up .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	this little alarm clock be ok but there be 2 main flaw with it . First and foremost I sleep deeply and snooze a lot before finally wake . this clock only allow 4 snooze , 4 minute apart , before the alarm just stop go off . also , when you have a travel alarm clock with a fold over cover like this please put a gap and a slight hole so the snooze button can be hit immediately without open the cover . my girlfriend have a alarm clock almost identical to this from Timex that have long since be discontinue and it handle all these feature perfectly . you would think something so simple would be easy to find . hopefully they improve this one someday . in all other way the clock be great .
AlarmClock	POS	4	it arrive and work as promise . the only negative be that the light do not light up enough to see the time at night when you push the button .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I see this radio at target and think it look really cool . I like the old-fashioned styling and the blue display . unfortunately , I quickly find two major problem with this . as someone state earlier , the display be too bright-it light up my room like a full moon and there seem to be no way to turn it down . the second major problem be that the volume dial do not turn smoothly , rather it be notch in such a way that there really be no way to control the volume . on the unit I have , either the volume be down all the way , okay at the first notch , and way too loud on the second notch . I like the nature sound , but the bird sound be rather silly because they sound like snippet from a dozen different habitat and be distract . the flowing water sound nice , though . tuning be interesting because the frequency be in 0.05 increment . so , to go from 90.5 to 90.7 , you have to push the up button four time instead of just once . while this be not a issue to go up one frequency , it be annoy to go up 5 or 10 . lastly , the speaker poop out on the second night . so , the radio be absolutely useless at this point . the radio be nice look and a little retro , but unfortunately , there be just too many design problem that make it a waste of money and time . it be go back to target first thing Saturday morning .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I buy this for my teen daughter that be a hard sleeper . ordinary clock never wake she ; this one however , shake she and wake she . in fact , it wake everyone in the house on both floor . the color be rich and the vibrator be really powerful . I love it and so do she . now , I can be at work without have to worry whether or not she be go to get up . she have literally no option with this clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my mother want a clock with number she could see at night . the extra large number , the largest I could find , be very clear from across the room to she . it be use also as a sort of `` night light '' to see about the room if she have to get up in the night . you also have the option of dim the number if it seem too bright for you . Easy to set alarm , and shut off which she love . at a very reasonable cost it be a perfect gift for the senior citizen or anyone who have difficulty see .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I have read the review about this Elgin Travel Alarm clock , but it be cheap enough I think I would give it a try inspite of the review . plus it be cheap enough that if it do not work , I would have spend more time and money to send it back so I have decide in advance to live with it and chalk it up to a lesson learn . besides , I have a similar model make by Timex that last a long time . question : where have Timex go ? so now , I will live with it but I will warn other ! as soon as I put the battery in , I find out the light do not work . I buy this model specifically for the light ! DO not waste your money !
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a okay alarm clock that work well , be easy to set , have a nice snooze feature , and have a initial beeping alarm that be not too loud but loud enough to wake I with out startling I . if ignore , the alarm get louder & more insistent by degree - a good feature but I never need it . it be larger than I expect -lrb- bigger than a softball , for reference -rrb- but not huge . the second hand sweep silently around the dial , no tick - nice . I give this a 3-star instead of 4 because the adjustable back light can not be turn off , only down to quite dim . however , the item description lead one to believe it can be turn off . I do not like a light shine at I all night , so this clock be a constant irritation . if I have know it can not be turn off , I would not have purchase the clock . also , since the back light can not be turn off , it make the push-button light rather pointless .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	I own one fo these clock , and I be shop for a new one . this clock just be not bright enough to illuminate my room properly . I dont ` wake up . : - -lrb-
AlarmClock	NEU	3	the screen never dim off . you have three scale of back-light to choose from but no off -lrb- rather annoy if you like to sleep in the dark and have a watch to check at time -rrb- . also , the sound be 5-10 second recording that be loop over and over , and you start to notice it as you clear you mind to go to sleep . it do its job , but do not expect total relaxation , nor a natural like feel .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I be disappoint in the fm audio quality for the FM broadcast band . it sound limited and mushy . also it could not reliably pick up a distant station which I can now get on a boombox -lrb- I return this unit -rrb- . it be very well make and very easy to program and I would recommend it to anyone who only want FM as a extra and do not plan on listen to FM a lot .
AlarmClock	POS	4	a little expensive , but its very straight forward . for example `` alarm : on - off '' . you do not have to be a psychic to understand the control . very refreshing .
AlarmClock	POS	4	we have a Sony dream machine with the atomic clock function . it have no battery backup and occasionally somehow `` lose '' the signal for the clock and end up with the incorrect time . this atomic clock radio do catch the signal and do have the battery backup function . it be not a $ 50 or $ 100 radio , but do the job well . the only drawback have be the small switch which turn the alarm on and off . for the price , I would buy it again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a cool-looking clock that work great as a alarm . the main reason we buy it be because the digital face of we previous alarm clock be too bright . you can adjust the brightness of the face of this clock or not have it light at all . the `` moonbeam '' wake-up component do not work for we as far as wake we up , but the alarm that follow be pleasant and loud enough to work . but not too loud or obnoxious . this clock look great in we bedroom - very retro and classy . we want the green one for we guest room .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have a similar clock that I buy in Tokyo several year ago . the original be a Seiko that still work but the alarm on\/off switch become loose and can easily turn off r on just by move the clock in the night . I choose this clock because it be very similar . it work as advertise . the alarm be loud enough to wake the heaviest sleeper without be too annoying . if I have to complain , it would be about the size of the display which be smaller than I have hope . however , it be easily read from the bedside .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	my wife purchase this alarm clock for I for Christmas 2007 . it be the second piece of Coby electronic equipment that I have own . my experience be that Coby build extremely cheap -lrb- meaning , poor quality -rrb- product . my complaint with this product be : 1 -rrb- the product do not keep accurate time -lrb- gain about 7-8 minute per month - most likely a electronics design flaw that recur in each of these alarm clock -rrb- . 2 -rrb- the product `` hum '' through the speaker -lrb- a short in the internal electronics due to poor circuit board design - also a design flaw that probably recur in each of these alarm clock -rrb- . interestingly , when the product be power ON , like when the user want to listen to a cd but have not yet hit the play button , the hum quit . BUT , if the unit be leave ON accidentally , the alarm do NOT work . I know . I power the unit on to get the annoying hum to stop and be late to work the next day because the alarm never sound . 3 -rrb- CD door be overly difficult to open and close -lrb- a coefficient of friction design flaw that be also recur , probably -rrb- . 4 -rrb- the lead display be overly bright and no dimmer switch be feature -lrb- yet another design flaw -rrb- . 5 -rrb- all plastic part be extremely cheap . White plastic cabinet part be not the same color of white -lrb- do not match -rrb- . silver paint on button will obviously soon wear off , etc. . while this alarm clock have all of the feature that I be look for in a alarm clock -lrb- except for the dimmer switch -rrb- , the aforementioned list of design flaw force I to return the product as defective . bottom line : very cheaply build !
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be such a attractive clock . number shine bright in a variety of color . it get my pre teen up . amazing . she try to beat the alarm . haha !! Works great !! wonderful gift idea .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the auto-time set be a defect in disguise . we buy a older version of this clock in 2002 or so . it be hardwire to change the time -lrb- for Daylight Saving Time , DST -rrb- on the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October . spiffy ! the radio time feed from wwv provide Universal Coordinated Time -lrb- GMT -rrb- , with no signal indicate the time change , so the clock be design hardwire with a offset from that , change at fix date . then come the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which `` change the change day '' to the second Sunday in March , and the first Sunday in November , start in 2007 . we older clock do not read the newspaper , so base on its old programming , it `` spring forward '' two week late and `` fall back '' a week early . that mean we have to change the time zone four time per year to keep it accurate -lrb- in we case from Pacific to Mountain time and back as need -rrb- . if you be absolutely sure congress will never ever ever change the DST date in the future , buy the clock , it be well make and accurate . if the manufacturer add a manual DST switch , or figure out some clever way to tell the clock when congress change the date , it be also good . BUT if congress meddle with the time change date again , and the 2012 change date be still hardwire in , you will probably angrily discard this `` automatic '' clock after a year or two of setting and reset it , and miss a appointment or two . then you will buy one of the manual set one , which might be off a few minute , but not a hour . it be a pity that we lord and master in Washington do not think about detail like this when they ignore the sun and tinker with the time . more afternoon golf time for they , while you kid wait for the morning school bus in the cold and dark .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love this clock with it be so easily read numeral . it can be see so clearly in the dark , and from quite a distance . I buy it to replace another like it -lrb- different brand -rrb- which quit work after many year . I know when that one stop I have to have another as quickly as it could be deliver . if you have trouble see , and even if you do not , this be the clock for you if you want to see the time from a distance . thank you Amazon for get it here so quickly even with the free shipping .
AlarmClock	POS	5	after use for 15 year everyday and everywhere , somebody sit down on it and break it . I be so happy they be still availabe . until I get they for all my grandchild who be not bear yet , please keep make this wonderful clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be redo my apartment and want a old fashion look alarm clock . this fit the bill with its art deco look . I have the pink one and it be a beautiful shade of pink . not bright like some here have say . think pepto bismol ! nor be it the bubble gum pink that little girl love . it be more a medium shade of pink . it have a silver band around the bottom that make it so attractive . now for what be more important , how it work . it be easy as pie , you just set the time and the alarm follow the direction in which to turn the knob in back . switch the alarm to on and you be do . when it go off , first you will get 5 minute of a gentle light that flash to wake you up . if after 5 minute , you do not respond than the alarm go off . it be more of a old fashion alarm clock sound than the buzz of new one . also , if during the night you have a power failure it have a battery operate backup . it just take 2 aa battery . I be surprised how reasonable the price for this one be . I have price other for a lot more . it be a real bargain and I be glad to have it now . I would highly recommend this alarm clock to anyone who be look for one .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a really unique product , it be extremely loud , and it vibrate the bed , so it really do what it say . however it do not wake my 13-year-old up , I wish they make something that would spray water on she ... maybe that would work .
AlarmClock	POS	4	little bigger than I think it would be , but work great and loud enough to wake I up .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I purchase the Timex Solar atomic clock with the last few month and it be work fine and be easy to set up not like some I have have in the pass . it be accurate , easy to read and right on . R.L. Bush
AlarmClock	NEG	2	recieve this clock and like everything about it except the atomic feature do not work so I be return it . have try to set the atomic clock many time include overnight to no avail . if you do not need the atomic feature it be light weight and stable on the bedside table unlike other atomic clock I have have .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock be innacurate and problematic throughout its brief life , and then it have a stroke , and then it die .
AlarmClock	POS	5	my eight year old son want this for he room . it come in on time . the packaging be in perfect condition . it be easy to use , my son have use it to wake up for school by himself . look great on he night stand . he put it in a different pose everyday .
AlarmClock	POS	4	its not a big clock , its around 12 inch . the light turn red when you push the head . I really like it . the only thing i didnt like its that the alarm have a very low sound .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	the snooze and light feature do not work on Darth Vader , no matter how much I push he head . I 'll have to return it for a warranty check . have anyone else have this problem ? Edit : Amazon have be very helpful with the warranty .
AlarmClock	POS	4	I buy this sun alarm 3 year ago and it have make a huge difference in how I feel after wake up in the morning . alarm clock use to make I feel edgy and tense but wake up to a slow simulated dawn be really peaceful . I have the backup radio alarm set to go off if the light do not wake I but so far I have only need that maybe a handful of time in 3 year . you do have to make sure the alarm be eye-level next to the bed for it to work really well though . the only gripe I really have be that there be a way to dim the display light but it be somewhat complicated and everytime the power go off -lrb- which be a lot in Florida -rrb- , I have to look it up again . but other than that , this be a decent product that accomplish the goal of wake up peacefully . :0 -rrb-
AlarmClock	POS	4	I really like this clock\/sound machine . there be one big problem . the volume control control both the sound -lrb- ocean tide , summer night , etc. -rrb- and the alarm volume . so if you want to have the soothing sound lull you to sleep at night at a low volume -lrb- which I can not imagine want it very loud -rrb- then the alarm volume be the same and will probably not wake you up . sad defect for a otherwise fine item .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I already have this clock but I order it for my niece , my mom also have the same clock along with my neighbor ! no matter where you look , this be the better deal , you can not find it any cheaper , even with shipping cost . have a light go off instead of a noise go off in you ear from be in a dead sleep be a lot more peaceful for sure . it fit into the style of my 1950 's home for sure ... Amy
AlarmClock	NEG	2	this alarm clock be easy to use and set up . it have a large time read out . the biggest draw back be the soft alarm . it need need to be much louder .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have have my Sunrise clock for over five year and it have make get up , especially in the winter when it be so dark , much easier and less jarring than a blare alarm sound out of the blue . it finally die yesterday , and I order a replacement today . I 'll have to make do with a traditional alarm clock until mine come . I highly recommend the sunrise alarm clock !
AlarmClock	NEG	2	when I google `` slow wake alarm '' this product come up a number of time , so naturally I read the reveiw , like what I see and order it . however , when I recieve my item I be far from impressed . what I be look for be a alarm clock that would start out slowly and quietly then progressively get louder . this one do not . grant it be not a advertised feature , but I feel that it be something that come along with the product from the other review I have read . in reality this be a regular alarm clock that wake you up with you choice of beep or nature sound . not what I want . this one get a big thumb down .
AlarmClock	POS	4	in the photo , this clock look blue . it be in fact , black , not blue as picture . not enough reason -lrb- quite -rrb- to return it , but disappointing . the dial do glow nicely when it be dark if put into auto mode , or when the snooze button be hold down . it be slightly bigger than I expect , but not a great deal . I like the fact that the alarm start quite subtly , and get louder and faster in stage . it be on the softer side , for a alarm , which I prefer , but if you be a heavy sleeper , it may not work for you . the dial glow be quite green , but not horribly bright . not nearly as bright as my cellphone , for example .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I agree that the light be too dim to be of any practical use . why do they even bother ? but I find that hotel have clock next to the bed that I can check if necessary . I just do not trust the hotel clock alarm and they be usually way too complex to set . so I have be use these for year with total confidence . they be reliable , simple , easy to pack , indestructable -lrb- suitcase have be store in blaze hot and freezing cold attic -rrb- and easy to set . since I figure the battery be go to go one of these day -lrb- they be yearssss old -rrb- , and it be easier to buy new than find replacement battery -lrb- much less find a screwdriver small enough to open the back -rrb- ... time to order a few more .
AlarmClock	POS	5	item replace the clock that my father have since the 50 's . Terrific item '
AlarmClock	POS	5	DIDD not buy it for alarm purpose . BOUGHT IT to keep time . and that , it do , oh SO WELL . ALSO have a very large screen for easier viewing . all in all , a good piece .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock will not keep the right time . it keep kick back a hour . I would not buy this product again . I have have other La Crosse item that I have really like . this one be no good !
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I get this think a larger clock would be easier to see from part way across the room . I need to watch the second hand to time my stretch exercise . unfortunately , I didnt look closely at the picture . the silver second hand be almost invisible unless I move the clock to right next to my face so I can see it . oh well . the clock work well so far , and I like the nice green color of the face at night . it be very cheerful and good company . just look closely . a red second hand be easier to see . that be the alarm hand .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I buy one , love it , play it all the time , use the alarm function to wake up . today , it be not work . nothing I can do to make the light come back on , make the alarm work again . if I touch a button , it come back on for a few seconds . battery be use for back up only so not sure why it be not work ! need another clock now ...
AlarmClock	NEG	2	receive the Westclox Travelmate today , and just print the return label . the face light do not illuminate ; AM\/PM do not appear on the face ; the alarm be barely discernable , and yes ... my hearing be excellent . cheap , cheap , cheap . the designer need to go back to the draw board .
AlarmClock	POS	4	product arrive in a timely fashion . the `` inside box '' - a.k.a the manufacturer box be a lil bang up , corner of the box be crumple . product still work fine though .
AlarmClock	POS	4	leave my previous travel-size alarm clock in Paris and go through a couple different one -lrb- slight more expensive -rrb- before I get this guy . I be very satisfied . it be very compact -lrb- travel + + + -rrb- , cheap -lrb- always a + -rrb- , and pretty simple . everything have dedicate control . my only issue be the same `` feel '' of the display and alarm on\/off control , so I have miss alarm occasionally because I simply slide the wrong slider -lrb- display control instead of set the alarm slider to ON -rrb- . still like it a lot after about six month .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	this be a decent alarm clock . it be fully hollow inside so it be extremely light . lead light do help to not drain out battery . light be extremely bright and somewhat distracting . Shipping & handle be poor because something be rattle around when I receive product .  glowing led color mood change Digital Alarm clock
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a handsome product ; a storm trooper clock that be reliable to wake my son up to school everyday . do not have to change battery often ; a bit pricey , but recommend .
AlarmClock	POS	4	Works fine except that it seem to drift toward run a bit fast over time . large display be easily visible from many foot away .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	this clock break in less than 6 month , most likely because I use it everyday and do a lot of snooze . it be small so do not take up much space on the night table or suitcase . if it be sturdier it would get more star .
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I buy this alarm clock for my young daughter in oct 2010 . she sleep with white noise and I think that buy a clock with the noise feature build in would be both space-saving and money-saving . it look nice and be easy to use . however , as other reviewer have say , the volume setting be not ideal ... set at 1 its very quiet , at 2 its annoyingly loud . it be nice to have the dual alarm - we set the second alarm for 8pm , put she to bed at 7:15 and when the bird chirp she know to put she book down , its light out . but any dual alarm will serve that purpose , with or without fancy noise . and here the worst part : March 2012 , one random morning the alarm never go off for school , and in addition to she too-loud white noise the clock be make a horrible buzz sound which can not be shut off . we unplug it and remove the battery , but when we reinstall the battery , the screen be mess up and it play sound 1 constanly -lrb- very loudly ! -rrb- , none of the setting button work and it can not be shut off . so after pay a decent price for a brand name , it last less than 18 mo and I be back to shopping for a alarm clock and a noise-maker . this certainly do NOT meet my expectation !
AlarmClock	NEG	2	I have never take the time to make a REVIEW BUT MUST SAY great design , great option -lrb- 2 alarm -rrb- , EVERYTHING great except one BIG THING ! I read this problem before I buy THIS & TOOK A CHANCE anyway . when you listen to the nature sound , ANY one ! about 30 minute in you fall asleep then wake up to a very loud pop almost like a shooting noise . picture feel RELAXED & FALLING ASLEEP to SOFT NATURE sound ... then wake up to ALMOST LIKE POPPING POPCORN RIGHT NEXT to your ear !! it wake MY HUSBAND & I up , it be so loud we scream ! you think we WOULD LEARN the 1st TIME WE try a different nature sound -lrb- think it be just that SONG recording -rrb- the NEXT NIGHT & IT happen again . both TIMES IT DOES not happen for about 30 minute to a hour , SO BY THEN WE be sleep ! REALLY THIS be the perfect clock if it do not have this issue . I do not KNOW HOW THIS get OUT on the market ! HOW DID IT pass inspection !
AlarmClock	NEG	1	very disappointing - the light do not light up the number well enough to read they in the dark . this will get return . I guess I need to keep shopping for something you can see at night time , this certainly be not it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this clock be even more than I expect it to be . it be fully electric with a battery backup . the 3 type of wakeup sound be crystal clear and very interesting . Timex 's reputation be even higher in my mind now that I own this clock .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock work fine , but the alarm be not loud enough for the elderly relative I purchase it for . if you need a clock for some one hard of hearing , search for the `` sonic boom '' brand , it be what we end up purchase to replace this .
AlarmClock	POS	4	small cube when you clap turn on it s a baterry saver very clean like it so far so good classic
AlarmClock	NEG	1	a horrible , useless clock . there be no light , so you can not read the damn thing when you wake in the middle of the night , and the cheap plastic frame break the first time I use it . I would return it for a refund , but for ten buck , I 'll just toss it and post this review . do not waste you money . if I be Elgin , I would be ashamed . I certainly will buy any Elgin product after be rip off like this .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a great portable travel clock - exactly what i want . this clock be compact and easy to throw in my pocketbook . it be easy to read the time , very simple to set the time\/alarm and be inexpensive . I be look for a small travel clock without any fancy feature and I find it - I would definitely buy it again .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have be oversleep on workday for the first time in my life - sleep through alarm . now no more worry . this really do work , and I find it very cute too . the sound be adjustable both in quality and volume - and the shaker really work . I be very grateful . it be easy to set both the time and the alarm . one reviewer complain about the brightness - and the number be bright during the night and change color , but I like it . be just hope that I do not annoy my neighbor , so I not set on the higher volume . this be definitely a very girly look clock . I have purchase three altogether - one for my bedroom , one for the living room set 20 minute later , and one for work - just to look pretty and keep I in touch with the time . you can can a visual alarm with a small row of light flash if you do not want the sound . I also purchase a extension cord which work fine . I be very pleased with this clock !
AlarmClock	POS	5	in case you worry that the bed shaker will not work , it do really shake\/buzz the whole -lrb- twin -rrb- bed in short annoying burst . you can choose vibrate only , vibe & alarm buzzer , buzzer only . the alarm buzzer volume & tone can be adjust a lot -lrb- all be quite annoying & guarantee to get anyone out of bed , esp if you heavy sleeper be awaken first by the bed shaker -rrb- . my daughter will not wake up with a regular alarm no matter how loud . usually I have to go in & harass the poor child , then keep go back to wake she up again ... & again . I work ; I do not have time for that ! this get she awake . the heart shape & color be very cute , & my 11 year old like the rainbow color time display . so far , she do not hate it yet . ; - -rrb- now I be look for one for boy !
AlarmClock	POS	5	as a Star Wars fanatic , this clock be fun to have and great to wake up to . it also inspire my son to wake up early .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this alarm clock be just what we be look for - easy to use and have a small footprint on we nightstand . it would easily fit in you pocket or a purse . when close , it measure just under 2 1\/2 `` w x 3 1\/2 `` l x 5\/8 `` D. it come with a `` button '' battery , rather than the more easy to replace aa or aaa battery . since we have no idea how long the battery will last , we decide to just buy a new battery and keep it on hand in the nightstand drawer . the Energizer model be 357\/303 -lrb- also #ag 13 , lr44 , exp76 -rrb- . these battery be sell at hardware store , Radio Shack , etc. .
AlarmClock	POS	4	they have change this clock since the review by dr that be currently list as most helpful . the small change be that it now use 3 aa battery instead of one c cell . the big , and good , change be that the clock now have a dimmer switch to adjust the brightness of the automatic dial light . you can adjust it from very dim to brighter than a night light . the light itself have also apparently change from earlier model ; now it be a even , overall green light dial instead of a hot spot of light . you can still also push the snooze button to get a very bright blue light . the bad part about this clock be the hand . some designer must have think they would give it some sort of `` look '' with the cut-out design of the hand instead of the functionality of a solid hand . the cut-out hand make it very difficult to see the time at night with the back-lit dial because the light come `` through '' the hand and fuzz they out . to be able to see the time require that you turn the dial light way up , which be very annoying in my opinion . fortunately it be easy to fix if you be even modestly handy . pry off the lens with a very small screwdriver at either the 6 or 12 o'clock position . Cut some black electrician 's tape with a fine scissors or x-acto blade to span the open cut-out on the hour and the minute hand and apply it . I use a tweezers to position and apply the tape , gently tamp it onto the hand to stick . the whole process take less than 5 minute and be now easy to read in day or night condition . I have upload a photo of the result .
AlarmClock	POS	5	this be a well make product that be go strong after month of use . my son love check the time before he get out of bed . the only `` downside '' be that the clock make a beep sound if the light to check the display be activate . I find that it be helpful that it be not consistently back light , which make the room darker and more sleep-friendly , but the `` beep '' can be annoying to those who be light sleeper like I be .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I love the easiness of use of this alarm clock : no mess up with `` mode '' , `` set '' and other button to access function I 'll never use . this alarm clock have four position : time set , alarm set , alarm on and alarm off . it be everything you need , and you can not go wrong . the alarm be loud enough and it be progressive . contrary to what the description say , it require 2 aaa battery , not 1 .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	within 6 month of purchase this item , the button control the 2nd alarm mode would get stick and be difficult to set . six month later the sound stop work altogether . be a good product while it last , but for the price it should have last longer . it must be make in China .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	water get into this two day after I use it in the shower , and the clock be no longer visible .  i leave it unused for two week , and the 6 c-battery have run out .  believe it or not , I believe I actually throw my receipt away when I get it ! -lrb- that be why I be anonymous . -rrb-
AlarmClock	NEG	2	when I find this while search for a alarm clock I be really impressed . a attractive look lcd picture frame with mp3 & alarm clock for less then many regular clock , what a deal ! when I open it I be much less impressed . First off , even though I use a ruler to try to visualize the size of a 3.5 '' screen , once I open the package and place it on my nightstand it just look tiny . then I try to use and within 10 minute I decide to return it . as a picture frame that you would put on you desk at work , maybe it be not too bad . even though the screen be small , in just picture mode it be not terrible . the screen be clear & bright , and the resolution be pretty good for what it be . but as a alarm clock it be terrible . you have 3 mode to display the time : a rendering of a analog clock -lrb- that only use 1\/2 of the screen so it be microscopic -rrb- , a full month calendar mode , and a clock\/date readout with a thumbnail photo . to look at the picture show in the Amazon description they all look pretty good -lrb- magnify on my 22 '' computer monitor -rrb- . but in reality , on such a small screen you need magnify glass to read the time in any mode . then I try to set the alarm . you have to go through 2 sub-menu and scroll down through 10 different option to set it . and push the completely non-intuitive button require quite a bit of force and they make a rather loud -lrb- low quality -rrb- click sound that will wake the kid in the next room . for instance , if you want to change the time from 6:30 to 7:15 literally take a few a minute because you have to hit the button like 30 time to get into the menu and scroll down to where you set it , then once for the hour and 45 time to change the minute -lrb- hold the button down do not let you scroll through the number -rrb- . in addition , it also display the indoor temperature and even though I let it sit on the nightstand for several hour it always read 10 degree higher then the actual temperature . to sum it up : as a cheap digital frame ; good as a alarm clock ; Bad
AlarmClock	POS	5	I be pretty satisfy with the clock . it be easy to setup . I follow the instruction and change the preset time to match my current time . the digit be large and easy to read from distance .
AlarmClock	POS	4	we buy this for we 9 year old daughter as she first alarm clock . she love the vibrate feature -lrb- so far anyway - have not actually use it to wake up over the Holiday yet - just keep set it to feel the vibration ! -rrb- . the rainbow number be really cool too ! I really would have give 5 star , but I do not like the sound of the alarm ... you can adjust tone and volume on it , but to I sound a bit like a smoke alarm or something -- just not thrill with the sound . in addition , the color on the picture do not represent the actual product in my opinion . I think it be go to be hot pink and it be not -- not sure how to describe this particular pink . otherwise , we be very happy with the product !!
AlarmClock	POS	4	item work exactly as describe . it actually get the signal from Colorado very quickly once I realize I need to turn on the wave . Buttons be easily hit accidentally which can cause the clock to change to 24 hr time or turn off the signal receiver .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	junk ... can not hear alarm ... I even press it up to my ear and can not hear it ... that pretty bad ... have no loudness control ... so order another one ... same thing ... call the mfg. . . she even admit that the alarm be not very loud on this model . . not very loud i can deal with , but silent I do not think so ... 2 out of 2 defective ... not a good deal ... which be to bad ... because I really do like the big red clock face and the fact that it set itself , .
AlarmClock	POS	5	th sonic boom sbh400ss sweetheart loud plus vibrating alarm clock be super !! Wakes I up but I do have a tendancy to use the snooze alarm too much -lrb- I seem to need that extra 9 minute . -rrb- the only concern I have be that the cord for the vibrator that go under my pillow could be longer so it could reach my pillow from a further distance , therefore , I would have to get up to set the snooze alarm which would then wake I up without have to go back to bed . : -rrb-
AlarmClock	POS	5	my brother love he lego Darth Vader , when you take it out of the package he say it look like ep 3 where Anakin become Darth Vader . `` PADME !! ''
AlarmClock	POS	4	the ratchet knob on the top set the time a minute per click , so it really take a lot of work to set a time 12 hour , but it do the job . the radio be not really that great but I can get local station ok . I take the clock apart and wire it to activate a fire buzzer when the alarm go off . the only part I need be a reed relay , some wire and a switch . now I can really wake up with a serious alarm . -lrb- any day of the week -rrb-
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I be a time geek . my watch be a Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium solar power `` radio '' watch that keep accurate time to a fraction of a second . I have two `` atomic '' wall clock that stay synchronize via radio signal . I buy the Chaney as it have nice size led number and would be perfect for the entertainment center since we new dvr do not have its own clock display . however , it lose about 2 minute a month and need to be reset constantly . I email the manufacturer and they say that be `` normal '' . the clock on my wall oven and microwave be more accurate ! if you be happy with know `` about '' what time it be , this clock be fine . if you want to know the RIGHT time like I , you 'll hate it ! I be give it to my wife to use in she sewing room .
AlarmClock	POS	5	excellent clock , keep time , get I up on time and I can read it in the middle of the night without any problem .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I put these little travel alarm any where I need a reliable time keeper and have limit space available . they fit on the toothbrush holder , window sill , just about any place . and the price be right .
AlarmClock	POS	5	great !! bigger than I think . the dot : colon in the MIDDLE do NOT flash . the clock have the correct time when I plug it in . I love this product . Easy to see at night . I only want a clock so I have not use the alarm feature and be not sure f it make a good alarm . excellent night time clock !
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I buy two of these about 1 month ago . one be work fine and the other one stop work after 1 week . I try another battery but it do not help . the light no longer work and the time make clunking noise and the alarm do not sound . I be go to try to get a refund or replacement for it .
AlarmClock	POS	5	original review 2007 : what a great surprise ! I order this simply to have a clock in the bedroom that could be read in the dark without glass ... and that be exactly what I get , but much much more ! I plug this guy in and it show the correct time ! check the instruction pamphlet -lrb- actually print large enough to read ! -rrb- and find that this clock will automatically keep up with the correct time and automatically reset for change to daylight savings and back ! this be great for I because we have a lot of clock and get they all change twice a year be a real chore ... especially the one that require two button push at once or whatever . I have be buy expensive atomic clock simply to get rid of this problem , but this one be MUCH better than a atomic , where you have to diddle with get good reception and then wait while it update ... sometimes overnight ! this little guy be program for all time zone , just flip a well label switch on the back to select yours ... not a menu , a good old switch that you just have to change one time ! what a great invention ... I hope all clock will adopt this system . no worry about power outage , no problem if you be move ... just unplug it and plug it in at you new location ... it keep time while it be unplugged ! and as far as be readable in the dark , the number be so big it be almost scarey when you look at it at night ... 10 star ! I 'll get back with a update if I discover any problem or failure . update after one year of use . 1 . this clock have never fail to show the correct time and have never fail to alarm properly , even in my rural area where power blip be a norm . 2 . one reviewer say there be no way to change the time if it be wrong ... that be INCORRECT ! 3 . one reviewer can not figure how the clock know what time it be ... well obviously it be set initially in the factory ... but probably the reviewer be just joking . it be set up and maintain its setting with a small battery which be rate `` up to 5 year '' durability . 4 . another reviewer pull the battery and say this ruin he clock ... can not imagine why he would pull the battery in the first place , but I do know there be instruction for do this . do note that the clock itself be the plug-in type ... it only use the battery to power the memory\/setup chip . after a year of use , this be still my favorite clock and I get mad every time I have to change battery on my atomic clock because they be such a hassle and I pay over twice as much for they . this be the one to buy . I be look for Chaney to come out with one that can show I the outdoor temperature as well and I 'll scrap all my junky atomic .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	this clock be a joke . they say it update with atomic clock . what they do not tell you be that it only do it every 2-3 day . so there go the whole big deal about it set itself or be accurate . if you need to replace the battery it will be day before you have the right time again . also no manual and no toll free telephone number mean I spend more on long distance call to find out why the clock be not work than what I originally pay for the clock . and the people at Equity Time USA give the word rude a whole new definition . the first customer person service person actually hang up on I because she be confuse . all and all stick with the clock you already have on you wall , I wish I would have .
AlarmClock	NEG	1	the sound be just terrible and when I turn the sound up\/down , I frequently have change the station to get it tune properly . and the cd work at first ; now it do not . -lrb- the sound be not that great , either -rrb- . a total waste of money . I should use my stereo or television to wake I up .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the Insta-Set feature of these clock be a little misleading . they be not atomic clock . they do not recieve a external signal to set the clock automatically like a atomic clock . like any other digital clock these clock gain or lose a few seconds a year . they have to be set occasionally . Google `` reset equity insta-set clock '' for instruction . basically , you hold down the DST or Alarm Set button for five seconds . you can then set the hour , minute , month , day ... like other digital clock . the documentation never say specifically what Insta-Set mean . apparently be just mean the clock do not have to be reset after a power outage . it have a internal battery that hold the time until the main power come back on . other than this misleading name for the insta-set feature the clock I have work well . it be worth what it cost .
AlarmClock	POS	4	the clock be nice . I give it four star becuase it be smaller than we think and be overprice . I like that the beep be not too loud and it be easy to program . look really cool in my son 's lego room .
AlarmClock	POS	4	this sound machine\/duel alarm clock be a very good product and work as describe . I be afraid that the display would be too bright , but it have setting to dim it down that make it better . the unit itself be a lot smaller than expect , which be not bad . use the control be fairly easy after a few use , because the unit be very lite you may have to use two hand to make change . the 20 different sound loop be very good , and long enough not to be too noticeable when they begin again . the alarm clock work well and never have fail to wake I up yet . overall this be a good product especially for the price . I would recommend this product to anyone look for a good sound machine alarm clock .
AlarmClock	POS	5	I order this clock for myself as a replacement . I give mine to my niece as a gift with other travel inspire item , but only after I confirm that I coud purchase another one on Amazon . I love it . I use it every day and night both at home and on trip . it be lightweight , accurate and easy to see . and when you wake up in the middle of the night and want to know the time , the INDIGLO feature on the Timex be terrific . no need to turn on a light . the Timex require one aaa battery . the battery should last a long time and be easily accessible for replacement . the Timex base fold over the screen and be perfect for travel . I not only would order the Timex Indiglo Travel Alarm again , I already have . J.C. Sterne
AlarmClock	POS	5	I have try several travel alarm clock . the Westclox Travelmate be the only one I will use from now on . it be easy to use and easy to take on trip . I like it so much that I use it nightly at home too .
AlarmClock	POS	4	just buy this very same travel clock for $ 6.75 plus tax at my local hardware store . have not try it yet ... hence only 4 star .
AlarmClock	NEU	3	I get this  Coby 3.5-Inch Digital Photo Frame with Alarm clock dp356blk  on the surface it look like a great buy because , for such a inexpensive item , it pack a lot of attractive function . namely , it can be use as : - Digital photo frame with a 3.5 '' panel at 320x240 resolution - alarm clock with digital and analog display - mp3 player upon testing this unit , however , I start to see some of its problem : - the setup process be rather clunky and at time counter-intuitive . for example , you often need to press LEFT\/RIGHT button for the menu to move up\/down - to perform any simple task often require push button dozen of time . for example , just to change the music volume you need to first go up to to-level menu , then go down to ` setting '' , and then `` System setup '' , follow by another dozen of key press to finally arrive at `` volume '' - the unit have no internal battery . that mean it must remain plug in and can not be pass around like other photo frame . fortunately , the clock and internal setting be not lose when I unplug the unit -lrb- otherwise I would go crazy if I need to reset the clock every time -rrb- - it have no internal memory for photo . that mean you have to insert a sd\/sdhc card -lrb- which stick out like a sore thumb from the back -rrb- - if you have both photo file and music file on the sd card , it automatically play the music file while in slideshow mode . the only way around it be to set the music volume to ' 0 ' . - the 3.5 '' display be really too small for use as a photo frame , as it be just 1\/4 the area of a print 4x6 photo . even when use as a alarm clock , the number can hardly be see from across the room . the most serious problem with this photo frame be that : in slideshow mode , it do NOT sort photo file accord to either file name or file date . so the photo show be all jumble up , with no apparent order . after much experimentation , I finally figure out that the unit simply show file in the order they be write to the directory . so the solution be to make sure that file be write to the sd card either in alphabetical order , or accord to file date . this be obviously a very tedious process if I have to do that manually for hundred of file . fortunately , I be able to find a free utility call `` fatsorter 1.04 '' , which can automatically sort all file entry in directory into alphabetical order . after do that , the unit finally can show photo in the correct sequence . I decide to keep this unit despite of all its problem , mostly because I have invest so much time in get it to work . also the low cost make it hardly worth the trouble of return it . but right after this lesson , I order the  pandigital panimage pi8004w01b
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I give the Panasonic Home Theater Audio System model sc-htb15 5 star . I have it hook up to a flat screen , blue ray , and game system . when turn on the sound come through and when off the sound come through the tv like normal , no button to push . I use the optical digital audio in terminal from the tv to the theater system . I then use a hdmus from blue ray and PS3 to system , hdmus out to tv . hook it up be very easy . speaker can be vertical or horizontal , hook together or separate , on wall or stand or foot , you choice . Subwoofer sit to either side . remote be basic on\/off , tv\/hdmi input selector , subwoofer + \/ - , volume + \/ - and mute . I must note my Samsung control also work with the theater system , which allow I one control use for less clutter . there be control on the sub woofer also . it have a nice clear sound and get louder then I will ever need . there be sound now hear in video game I never know be there , like you enemy in the grass , or glass shatter in the distance , it be fantastic . Blue ray movie be better then the theater . I would recommend to anyone want a simple , easy to use system for full sound without tweaking . you have multus channel mode , auto mode -lrb- direct mode -rrb- and 2-channel mode .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I have own this system since June 2004 . ok for a basic system , but you can do better , even with home-theater-in-a-box . in many way , I prefer my old 1997 Pioneer 5x100w receiver & 1999 Pioneer dvd player . pro 's - very stylish look - great sound clarity for this level system - appreciate the color-code speaker connection CON 's - it be reasonably loud , but i just do not feel the raw power . my friend have a $ 2000 Denon system that have the same clarity , but shake you to the bone ! more comparably , i have a 1997 Pioneer system w \/ 100w per channel -lrb- same as dav-fc8 -rrb- , but feel more powerful , albeit way less refine . - occasionally , dvd will start-up with no sound . a power-off\/power-on sequence usually fix this - surround sound seem weak - my LR surround speaker have become very staticy . sony do not sell a replacement part , so they want $ 130 to repair . - disc take a long time to change\/load . make this worse , the dvd player do not resume a disc from where you leave off after turn the system off\/on . - you can not save separate sound field 's for each function -lrb- video-in , Tuner , dvd , etc. -rrb- - the front speaker be easily topple by a small child -lrb- my 9-month old nephew , in this case -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	a lot of punch in a small package . great sound , pretty easy setup , although I do not like the speaker connection too much .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I purchase this unit and have be very surprise at the sound quality it provide . if you set this unit up for the room it perform like a much more expensive unit . the bass be good , rear support be good , and the volume of the center front channel be also adjustable .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	great product , compact design , very good functionality , easy to set up . I love it . could use a better look design , but it be ok .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	it be be couple of day i have this product , i have both goods and bad to share .  Goods : 1 -rrb- excellent sound quality 2 -rrb- very stylish 3 -rrb- ability to play all kind dvd 's , mp3 disc , VCD 's and of course regular cd 4 -rrb- sound be good enough for any bedroom or office room , but not for a big size living room 5 -rrb- have a pretty good AM\/FM tuner  bad : 1 -rrb- what the heck a fan be do behind the reciever , I have play with so many music system but none have a fan -lrb- probably mean for cooling . -rrb- 2 -rrb- you can not use random feature with mp3 disc , i guess this be a very desirable feature . 3 -rrb- Wish there be a clock\/alarm feature 4 -rrb- Speaker wire be not lengthy enough for a decent size bedroom
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	do not buy ANY Panasonic Products . my Home Theatre that I buy be the sc-ht830v . I pay nearly $ 400 for it . exactly 1 year & 2 week after buy it , the display quit work , and no sound come out of the speaker . one year after spend $ 400 , its worth nothing . and , of course , they customer support be nicely say ... `` I be sorry , sir , but since it be out of warranty , company policy say we can not do anything . '' so , despite spend $ 400 -lrb- which be a lot to I -rrb- , they would not do a thing because I the system break 2 week too late . therefore , they lose a customer ... for life . and I urge you to stay away from they .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	wonderful crystal clear sound , get all the feature I want : VCD , CD , mp3 , progressive scan , DTS , pro Logic , 5-cd changer ... only complain be the disk changer be sort of slow , but hey , as long as I dont have to get off the couch . : -rrb- my 1st buy be a Panasonic sc-ht75 from circuitcity . it be nice , but the quiet rear speaker be really disappointing . now that Amazon be sell sc-ht95 at amost the same price I pay for the sc-ht75 -lrb- after the rebate for 95 and tax for the 75 -rrb- , I make the switch immediately . with 75 , I have to turn up the rear speaker to max and turn down the front speaker to feel a hint of ` surround ' sound . for 95 , even at a low volumn I can vividly hear bullet fly pass by my ear ! Hav not get a chance to test the progressive scan yet , which be a major feature the sc-th75 lack . all in all , excellent machine and powerful speaker at a great price , highly recommand it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be the perfect system it stand up with bose if not better . clear sound no distortion . high , mid , and low ; JBL have it cover with this system and include everything you need for setup include Wall hang mount .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	consider the bargain we get this for , I be very happy with the result . it be easy to get home , very easy to set up . the include mount material be all we need to keep everything look good around the living room . my only major complaint so far be that the video and audio seem a little out of sync on some channel that I never notice before we hook up this unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	back in 2000 , I purchase this system to be my all-in-one home theater . while $ 700 can now get you much , much more , this be a great system for I . speaker be not overly powerful , but they be extremely easy to set up and run , good sound quality , and stylish . I have have it for almost 6 year and only complaint be a crappy dvd lense -lrb- reader -rrb- . some disk be stubborn , but still play . I typically troubleshoot by re-loading dvd until it would read . then , I get smart and purchase a scotch dvd cleaner from BestBuy , which greatly help . lastly , when Progressive scan dvd player come down in price , I just buy one for cheap to get higher picture quality and run sound through Panasonic -lrb- use as traditional receiver\/speaker setup , not all-in one -rrb- . I have finally outgrow this set , but I do plan on run it in my bedroom as I replace with a higher-end , more digitally enable system . speaker be too weak for big family room , and no digital audio in\/out or upconversion ability .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy this system a couple of month ago because I want a setup to replace my CD player , dvd player , Radio Tuner and sound receiver . I also want to go digital and have more power . this be the best system ever , and the best upgrading decision I have ever make ! sure , it be work to set it up , but you can go to any store -lrb- best buy , Circuit City ... -rrb- and ask for help . as far as hookup go I actually think it be relatively simple as long as you get a digital cable -lrb- which you would be crazy not to -rrb- . connect coaxial out on the player to coaxial in on the receiver and you be rockin . all you have to do then be hook up the speaker and sub-woofer . from there you can just set it up how you want it . besides , I recommend read the manual thoroughly for any electronic device . especially with this one -lrb- both dvd and receiver -rrb- because there be so many cool little feature that you would never figure out on you own . the sound with this be incredible . music be great -lrb- especially with sub-woofer -lrb- isolate bass from treble , imagine if bass guitar and lead guitar be play through the same amplifier , that be not right , they be two separate instrument on two separate channel , as present here so you get more accurate reproduction -rrb- , and movie in digital mode be almost better than the theater -lrb- movie like Star Wars , Lord of the ring , and 007 truly rumble -rrb- . the remote for both be very comprehensive , well lay out , and usable -lrb- in fact they be almost interchangable -rrb- . if you be look for a great , powerful home theater system with great feature and truly accurate sound reproduction , look no further than Sony and especially this model . you 'll be blow away !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	the set up be really easy for this . . but for some reason I can not get all the speaker to work . the color code wire make it idiot proof . . but the mid range speaker will not work .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this receiver be excellent . the ipod iPhone charge station be cool . need to have you own speaker for upgrade . I sell the speaker that come with unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I can not accurately express how great this product be in a few paragraph , but I 'll try . I 'll start by say that I already have a blu-ray player -lrb- PS3 -rrb- , so I be look for a surround system that be affordable and easy to set-up , actually sound good , and feel like a quality product . after use the system for a few day I can tell you that it have more than accomplish these thing . I pay full retail price , which be $ 350 , but again , I only need a surround system by itself , no dvd or blu-ray player , which be what the majority of system seem to be these day with bd become more popular . that say I be willing to pay a little more if it be a good system . the system come with a central speaker , two front speaker and two surround speaker to achieve 5.1 surround , which be plenty for a apartment like mine . there be also a very powerful subwoofer include as well , so when I have a home I can really pump the bass . additionally , the power be 1000w . know a bit , but not a whole lot about surround sound setup , this system make it ridiculously easy for I to set it up and get go . each speaker be color-code for easy installation , which seem like a no-brainer but this be not always the case . so anyway , you plug the wire into each speaker and then into the receiver and plug in the subwoofer and you be do with the wiring , it be really that simple . the wire be plenty long for the two surround speaker as well , so that be not a issue . there be also a auto-calibration microphone that come with the system that you place where you sit when you watch tv and it do its thing in less than 30 seconds and you be system be calibrate positionally just like that . I have watch a few blu-ray so far and the sound really be great , top-notch really . if you have never have a surround system before , you do not know what you be miss ! I could never watch a movie again without it . its a very powerful system as well , I be wait for my neighbor to say something soon lol -lrb- which be why there be night mode include -rrb- there be many mode you can use as well , such as Dolby pro Logic with 5.1 support , sport , game , music etc. . . Sports give you a reverberate sound as if you be at the stadium listen to the announcer , pretty cool minor stuff . now , there be also 3 hdmus input include , which be partly why this system be a little pricier than other , but it be well worth it . so I have my PS3 and DVR hook into the receiver with one to spare . it be nice to just switch the receiver to which one I want rather than the tv , I basically do not need my tv remote anymore . I know there be no ipod dock include , but you can buy a $ 8 cable -lrb- red and white tip -rrb- and play it through that , so it be not really worth the $ 100 + Sony dmp dealy . so there you have it , a great system for the price from Sony , who come through in the clutch once again . ignore the review that say they think this have a blu-ray player with it , I be not review Amazon , rather I be review this product . pro : 3 hdmus input , great sound , sleek and compact , easy set-up , auto-calibration . con : a tad pricy but the quality be there if you do not need a blu-ray player and you do not want to deal with annoyingly complicate set-up , this be the system you want .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I be a real Panasonic fan and usually love they product , but if I have my choice again I would buy something else . I be not angry I buy this , but I be sure there be better out there .  I be not a real audiophile , so I do not feel qualify to rate the sound on this system . Suffice to say I have be very happy with that aspect .  the feature , however , leave a lot to be desire .  First , pretend that this be a single-disc player . you can not change a disc while do anything else . you can not change a disc while play another disc , while listen to the radio , you vcr or auxilliary channel . add to that the fact that change from one disc to another take around ten seconds -lrb- easily twice the time I be use to for change disc -rrb- . it also stop after each disc - you can not set it to play all disc through .  second , this be the only cd-player I have see in year that skip regularly . on disc that play fine on all my other cd player , this one skip , stutter and sometimes stop entirely . it seem about as good as the first generation of cd player , back in the late 80 's . I intend to call customer support about this - hopefully this be not normal for this system .  Third , the control be confuse and difficult to use . I be a technical person who usually dive into all the setting on everything , but the control for the various surround mode seem ill-thought-out and generally difficult to commit to memory .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have two of these . one be a model that be no longer availible and the other be the current model . I boughtthe first to replace a sony rack system that i have for about ten year . I would still be usee it if lighting have not burn it beyond repair . I try many through a rental company and find that thy do not meet the quality that i have become acustome to . when I find this system , it once again make I ask the question , be that dog bark outside or on the tv ? the only thing that i have a complant about be that I have a dvd and sit PVR and both have digital audio out . the older version only have the one in with the choice of either optical or coaxial . this one have they seperate between video 2 and video 3 . I love it now . I still use they both .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	subwoofer and satellite speaker never work . three call to Vizio support be no help . with all the time I have waste try to get this to work , I could have buy a full price bose system . sorry , have to run and repackage everything to send it back .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the head unit be a bit slow - could use more process power . and my PS3 be a better bluray player at the end of day .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I be very disappoint with this speaker system . the lousy speaker on my tv sound much better . I have to turn it off at first , but then experiment a little more . it sound half way decent if you be only listen to music . Kind of like a old garage sale radio . it sound terrible for tv and movie though , which be what I buy it for . the sound be very flat , and even though I turn the rear speaker up all the way , they be barely audible . I would not really suggest this system for anyone , even those on a limited budget like I . you can find a system that sound better in most garbage dumpster .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	we have own Onkyo component for over 15 year now . when we decide to upgrade we exist Onkyo receiver to take advantage of the new technology for home theater , we know we want to stay with the Onkyo brand . after check models\/prices locally , we look online and come across this system on -lrb- ... -rrb- and decide to go with it . the system ship and arrive as advertised but after set it up we start have problem with it within week . we run all of we audio\/video component through the receiver then out to TV & speaker . we first problem be that when watch dvd the picture would blank out for a few seconds periodically and be not isolate to just one damage disk . the sound would continue on through these black out without interruption . for troubleshoot I bypass the Onkyo receiver with the video output from the dvd player directly into the tv . the video black out stop . when I contact -lrb- ... -rrb- about the problem , I be tell that I have to deal directly with the retailer that ship it , not Amazon . I contact the retailer and be tell that we need to contact Onkyo for repair\/assistance . since we have a viable workaround to this issue we decide to skip the hassel of disconnecting\/boxing\/shipping the unit back and be without a stereo for 6 - 8 week or more . well , about 8 month later the same thing start to happen when we be play tape in we VCR . again , I bypass the receiver directly to the tv and the problem stop . we do have other `` issue '' with the Home Theater in a Box system , such as the speaker not be very good quality , the subwoofer box rattle and we find a loose piece of wood in it . we never have a problem with we previous Onkyo component . we have subsequently purchase a new Onkyo receiver from a local retailer and have not have any problem with it at all . obviously we still like Onkyo brand and do not know if we problem be relate to purchase a `` refurbish '' system or not but it be hard not to draw that conclusion .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	despues de buscar un buen sistema de teatro en casa , que no I costara una fortuna y trajera todo lo necesario , este sistema de rca fue el mas indicado en el papel y despues de tenerlo por 6 mese puedo decir que es mas que indicado ya funcionando , tanto para peliculas como para musica . Al principio tuve un poco de temor por la marca -lrb- RCA , no e fuerte en hi-fi , no ? -rrb- , pero la calidad es muy buena , no ha fallado nus un momento desde que lo instale y ademas trae todo lo necesario para conectar los equipos . El receptor tiene mas que suficiente potencia y tienen un nivel de distorsion muy bajo por lo que es muy bueno para musica . El decodificador DTS e muy bueno , definitivamente suena mejor que el Dolby 5.1 y este receptor lo maneja muy bien -lrb- si que se sentira en el cine -rrb- . otro punto importante es la cantidad de entradas que tiene , digitale opticas y coaxiale , RCA de audio y video y de s-v ideo , y que la asignacion de cada una a lo equipos que le conecta es muy facil . como otro han mencionado , el subwoofer podria ser mejor , se siente un poco corto de aire a altos niveles de volumen , pero este se puede cambiar por otro pasivo -lrb- el receptor tiene el amplificador de 200 watt , por lo que un subwoofer mejor lo aprovecharia -rrb- o ponerle otro amplificado , pue tiene una salida extra . Los parlante frontale no son del todo buenos tampoco , pue siento que colorean mucho las frecuencias altas . por ello los cambie por mis Panasonic que tenia de mi equipo anterior y el equipo suena mejor -lrb- estos parlantes son mas grande -rrb- . Debo dejar claro , sin embargo , que el equipo suena muy bien con lo parlante originale . La unica queja real que tengo con este sistema es por el control remoto , no tiene codigos para dvd 's y no maneja bien lo aparato a lo que si se les asigna codigo . Practicamente lo uso solo para el receptor . Definitivamente recomiendo el sistema para quien quiera gozar de la musica o de lo soundtrack de pelicula .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	Panasonic pack a lot of value and versatility into its SC-HT400K Home Theater System . the quality and feature of this system make it worth every penny of the manufacturer 's suggest retail price and a genuine bargain at the discounted price find at retailer .  setup be reasonably straightforward , although the spacing of speaker terminal be tight even for small finger . a built-in white noise generator make balance the output of the speaker a snap .  most of the half dozen sound field that can be impose on the output -- range from a intimate club venue to a stadium - while more pleasingly understate than other I have hear , will , I suspect , find little use by most listener . one of those field , however , be very effective and clever . the `` party '' mode allow the listener to walk about the room without perceive the source of sound to shift from speaker to speaker .  the sound from the speaker be unforced and transparent-at least at level that the dog and the neighbor will tolerate . the rear speaker do not make themselves obvious as a source of sound -lrb- except when the source material deliberately place the sound at those speaker -rrb- . the general effect of the rear speaker be subtly to pull sound from the plane of the front speaker into three dimension .  last year the leading consumer magazine rate Panasonic 's stand alone receiver , sa-he100k , a best buy . a comparison of the sc-ht400k 's receiver with the sa-he100k receiver do on Panasonic 's website show the two receiver to be substantially the same , with the sc-ht400k lack a few feature that its brother have . -lrb- for example , the sa-he100k be a 6.1 channel receiver ; it have a output for a rear center speaker . -rrb- if the price difference between the sa-he100k plus a set of speaker and the sc-ht400k package narrow enough , the purchaser might want to consider buy the former separate rather than the latter system .  after the foregoing kudos , why give the sc-ht400k a rating of only four star ? the subwoofer that I get with this system be defective . fortunately , there be a authorized Panasonic repair shop within ten mile of my house and the defective part be replace in a week at no charge under the manufacturer 's warranty . nevertheless , the defect be a inconvenience and should not have get past quality control .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	just hooked this up to my Hitachi 60 '' LCD\/Projection TV and be very pleased . you may read review from `` bass-head '' who be only interested in ridiculous thumping , not purity of sound , but I can tell you this system sound fantastic . my family room be 20 x 15 and these speaker fill the room with a rich , vibrant sound rival that of a bose system -lrb- cost twice as much -rrb- that I try and return .  the subwoofer be perfect for the system - it add rich base without sound like one of those `` install by a teenager '' car system you hear so much of today , and it do not take up the entire floor to do it . we could not reach full volume before the system be too loud for comfort . 12db on the dial be enough to drown out any attempt at normal conversation . the surround sound be phenomenal -lrb- Matrix Reloaded play Progressive scan Component out be we baseline movie -rrb- .  the manual be a bit tedious . I be pretty technically inclined , and this be a bit of a challenge for I . the fact that the remote have a shift-key say a lot . plan to spend some time master this thing .  bottom line : if you be look for a chest-cavity shake , hip hop dance club thumping system , buy discreet component . if you be look for a attractive , affordable , incredibly clean sound system with very high quality component , this be definitely the system for you . easily 5 star for this price .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	well , when I unpack the box of this rather inexpensive home theater and take the fifteen or so minute to hook it up , I have less than fantastic expectation .  I be thrill to hear the quality of the sound when I finally sit down to watch a movie with the new system , but disturb when I find out that the loud , booming theater-like audio salvo that be assault my apartment be the product of volume level one . the scale go to over thirty , I believe -lrb- and I can only imagine who would take it up that high -rrb- , but , as you would suspect , there be nothing below one that produce any sound at all .  I could not watch the movie that night ... or any night for that matter . if I have , I be sure the neighbor would have be beat down the door . it be far too loud for any but the most diehard of loud-theater-like sound fan . the manual and other review say adjust the `` Dynamic '' set within one of the menu help resolve this , but it do not seem to do much at all with the unit I purchase .  the next day , I pack everything back into its box and return it to the retailer . I later purchase a similarly price Venturer model ... it be scale go to 100 , and one be nearly inaudible . much more control ... nearly the same sound quality .  I would stay away from this model unless the room it will be install in be of massive proportion and you enjoy wipe blood from you ear .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	we buy this home theater system for Christmas and have be nothing but impressed . the sound quality be absolutly wonderful . I highly recommend it if you like thing loud . plus I do not think that we would use the 5 disk dvd player , but now I find it useful and glad that we go with the 5 disk dvd player .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	this be a nice little home theater system and it serve the purpose for which it be intend . it be small , easy to put together , have detail instruction and produce a nice quality sound for watchinig movie without be too overwhelming . this be definitely for home use , so anyone who be look for a booming , thunderous effect in a larger area will not get it from this unit . I be unable to hook it up to my 20 year + stereo system , but that be no surprise . I also could not get that itsy bitsy remote to work . but these be not deal breaker and overall , it do quite well in my family room .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I have have this system for almost a year now . every thing on it work great . there be a few exception like hold the ff and rw to actually rewind and fast forward . also , to those look for true wireless please think . do you want you speaker to be run on battery ? it have to have a terminal to connect to the back speaker . I be have to send the system in because the fan be bust due to a power surge . a minnor hasle , over all it produce great sound and great picture quality . Great for beginner and expert user for a affordable price
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I have have a Sony dav-fc7 for about 1 1\/2 year . I know when I buy it that there be a few bad review , but like anything , it be expect that not everyone will be happy with it and there will be a bad experience here or there . plus it be not a top of the line device anyway . however , the odds of have a bad experience with this unit be unrealistically high as note by the other 28 review post just on Amazon . I primarily use mine for the home theater aspect . it be only have a couple dozen dvd 's play probably . recently while try to watch a dvd , it lock up 3-4 time just like a computer lock 's up - but computer lock up be generally due to configuration or software issue , not hardware . I have to cycle the power each time to get anything to respond , then find my place again in the movie . now just two day ago , I notice that it have the ` standby ' message flash continuously , the same as many other have note . I can unplug it to ` reset ' it , however , now I can hear audio , but have no picture come though it . the dvd part do not work at all , I think there be a stuck dvd in it . the ` reset ' appear to have only short term effect as well . I have to unplug it each time I turn it off - otherwise the ` standby ' message take over . of my last 3 Sony purchase -lrb- vcr , dvd , camera -rrb- , 2 of the 3 have be flaw . shortly after I purchase a Sony vcr , the front panel display go out . everything else seem to work okay -- you just can not tell by look at it what it be do or even if it be on\/off . nice craftsmanship\/design - Sony . I be hope my camera fair better over the long term - which should be consider longer than a few month or 1 1\/2 . I can guarantee , Sony will not get any more of my dollar for a long time .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I search , research and review every thing I could find about home theater system for about 3 week before choose the Panasonic sc-ht400 . I select it for 3 reason ; value , performance and brand reputation . and my homework pay off . this system be easy to set up ; only take I 25 minute to set up the 400 and a Panasonic progressive scan dvd \/ hi-fi VHS combo unit . it also have lot of little extra and a clear instruction manual . but more important than any of that ; it sound incredible ! deep clear bass from the subwoofer , crisp and clear sound from the satellite and excellent preset and adjustment option . I find the sound quality to be on par with Pioneer 's receiver and jbl speaker . and this unit be just as amazing when play dvd 's as it be when listen to music . I whole heartedly recommend this system , especial in conjuction with the Panasonic pv-d4743 . this be the best home theater system I find ...
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	just unboxed the MartinLogan MLT-2 Home Theatre , and I be so far blow away by the quality and construction of the entire unit . when this unit pop up on Amazon for $ 399 during the black Friday sale , I too be somewhat skeptical b\/c I could not find any real info or review . since the purchase I contact MartinLogan and ask about this setup , and they let I know this be not make in house-but rather make in China . they do stand behind the product , and feel even at the retail of $ 1,299 its still a amazing set . for more info visit : -lrb- ... -rrb- for a receiver I purchase the Pioneer vsx-1020-k 7.1 Home Theater I will post full sound detail shortly .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	Onkyo have be know for they strong home theater reciever and there speaker . the ht-s650 be a strong package with good quality feature . the Onkyo reciever deliver 100 watt to each channel with build in Dolby Pro-Logic 2 -lrb- for VHS movie -rrb- Dolby Digital and DTS decoding . with its WRAT -lrb- wide Range Amplifier Technology -rrb- , this reciever be build to last . it be input and output include S-Video , Optical Digital , and a 5.1 Channel input -lrb- for dvd audio and sacd -rrb- . the Onkyo speaker sound great . the front speaker be magnetically shield so the speaker be strong and give out good quality sound . the Center and Surround speaker be well balance with 4 '' woofer and 1 '' balanced tweeter . the subwoofer have a build in 150 watt amplifier with a 8 '' long-throw woofer , so you 'll be sure that you be get deep bass . the package also include a remote for the reciever , speaker cable , and a instruction booklet . even though it do not come with a dvd player , its still a great system for people who be new in the home theater world or just for people who like to upgrade they small system . Great Value .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I purchase this system in Aug 2004 and I be very pleased with its performance . Recording be very easy and I especially like the time-slip feature this allow you to watch a show from the beginning and continue to record the program . so long vh tape forever ! the system deliver a terrific picture and the sound make every show , movie , and sport event a new experience . I also enjoy the am-fm radio that be build into the unit . I be sure that the high-end system blow this unit away but for the money and the size this be a great buy !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I really like this sound bar . the rear speaker be wire to the sub and the sub be wirelessly connect to the sound bar . I have the same problem with the LED 's after 1 day . a call to Vizio support fix the problem . just disconnect power to the sound bar and press the power button on the sound bar for 1 minute . then reconnect the power and the LED 's work again . if it be not for this I would have rate it 5 star . also it be $ 50 less at Walmart . com . sound be not audiophile quality but close enough to impress . Works better on movie than music and eliminate run wire all around you room . definitely worth the price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I receive my norcent dp1800 17.12.03 . I be so excite with it . I set it up immediately . it sound great . my wife and I first watch lord of the Rings & quot ; the two Towers & quot ; at first she say where be the bass , I think it would have have more bass , and then it hit she wow what great sound . she be not easily impressed , but she be with the dp1800 . the only thing though be that the power can not be turn on or off with the remote . other than that , I recommend it to anyone who be interested in a highly efficient low price range home Theater System . it be a great buy .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	... look for a decent , reasonably price unit in store be a joke , so do not waste you time . after look on line , we take a chance on this unit , and have not regret it . I be sure there be better system out there , but you will pay a arm and a leg for they . this one do the job and be more than worth the money and trouble to order it on line . the only complaint we have be that the system will not allow you to control the speaker individually , but I be not sure that this be a option that any system give you , so take that comment with a grain of salt . other than that , the sound be great , the system be aesthetically please , and if you already have a dvd player and do not need a system that include one , this be a must purchase for you .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be my first review ever on Amazon and want to state how pleased I be with my Vizio Surround Sound system . it sound great and I barely have to turn up the sound 1\/4 of the way before produce clear sound . I have a open sit area where the family spend most of the time and it sound very well . I have not have any problem with my light go out on the sound bar as other have state . I have have it a little over 1 month and be very pleased thus far . if I start have lead issue , I 'll come back and update my review .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	the sound quality be fine , and I think it be fairly straightforward , but I do not understand how they do not have a digital audio input , which most high-end tv have . instead , you have to use analog sound , which not only defeat the point but require a converter . it be just a bummer if you be hope to make this a surround sound system for you tv .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I do not buy mine on amazon but pay 1\/2 the price at radio shack though . it be awesome . I do not know about the dt stuff but my movie , directv , music and etc sound awesome . I be glad I purchase this system . I have have it nearly a year and I love it . I will never get rid of it unless I want more wattage but at the present time 200 watt of power be excellent !!
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I usually do not leave product review but because I feel burn so badly on this one I have to say something to warn everyone else . I be actually online search for a way to remedy the pop and hiss , think I must have be do something wrong , and then I run across other review that be state the same problem that I be have . this system really be pathetic peace of junk and I have be totally embarrass by they on more than one occasion . they will pop and hiss -lrb- loudly -rrb- then the sound will totally disappear . forget this system and do not give Panasonic another dime . if I be look for a new system I would go with bose . yes , bose system be expensive but they know have payment option on they website and I can guarantee you will not get these type of review form they system .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	awesome sound for such a small system . Great for small New York apartment where space be at a premium .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	i have only have it for about a month and so far its be great i have hear all brand of shelf system and this one be the best yet you can crank it all the way up with no distortion the only drawback be if something happen to the remote you in trouble because you cant control nothin without it the cd dvd changer drawer do look flimsey but so far no problem in short if you want a nice system for the bedroom or office this be the one .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	everything seem ok about this , but I cant hear the voice channel very well . I pretty much have to turn it up to 35-40 to be able to hear much voice durr a movie ... if I could fix that I would be plenty happy .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I just buy this system to take advantage of my movie and game . and man , do it ever ! this system be great in everyway the sound be just incredable . I hook up my Sony dvd Player , XBOX , Playstation 2 , Gamecube and VCR to this system and it blow I away . it be like watch a movie for the first time and play a game for the first time . I highly recommend this system to everyone . best system ever .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I buy this dvd home Theater system a few month ago . it be not too expensive but then again it be very heavy and large and not well design at all . so if you want it to look good do NOT BUY THIS .  another problem I have with my dv-115 be that the dvd 's I play always have a `` break '' in they . this may be due to the change layer but I feel there be often more `` break '' and at different moment in the disc .  also at regular interval my player start to slow down . the picture and sound slow down , become slurred and that be not a problem with the disc because change disc do not help at all .  so when it work it be a great -lrb- albeit quite large -rrb- system , but I can not rely on it to work properly ...
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	my purchase of a nice sony 32inch wega require the accompanyment of a nice surround system . the ht5100d have a bunch of wonderful aspect . First and foremost it have amazing dt playback . with the optical cable hook up -lrb- which be not include and range from about 40-80 dollar -rrb- this system sound crystal clear . it allow you to adjust to the imperfection of you living room or anywhere else you might put this system . for example ... this system allow you to choose the surround sound quality and the distance speaker be set from one another . this allow for a excellent listen advantage in any room . another excellent thing be the cd\/dvd changer . although I think I would never need a dvd changer I be so wrong ... with the addition of almost 100s of dvd it be imperitive that you have a changer . another great thing be the visual aspect of this system . it be entirely gray ... which if you own a Wega like I match perfectly !  now a few downside ... the cd playback be a bit weak . in fact if you not run DTS the system in general be a bit weak . you need to seriously crank it to catch the key phrase . something that I do not need to do with my old Harmon Kardon system ... -lrb- of course that system break and be 100s more expensive ! -rrb- another downside be the bass . a mere 50 watt pump a un-impressive subwoofer . with such a nice high sound system I expect a bit more in the low range . of course sub be sub and you can always upgrade later , although currently Sony do not offer a great selection .  overall this have be a great system . it be powerful and what be more it be very price worthly ! you get a lot out of this system for a small price , even if it do eventually end up in a spare room somewhere it will always be reasonable . enjoy , and remember to upgrade on the cable ... espcially the optical , it make all the difference ! happy listen !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be my first home theater system so I can not really make a justified comparison with other system but as far as I can hear , the sound quality be very good , the thumping of the bass mixed very well with the satellite ... the additional feature , include Dolby pro Logic 2 that be still rare in this price range , be exceptional ... I do not know why people be complain about the remote control , I think the button be intuitively place and if you be like most people that 90 % use you rc to change channel and access menu , chance be in a month or so you would remember where the button be -lrb- and this also eliminate the complaint that say there be no control button on the dvd\/receiver it self ... let 's be honest nobody really get out of they couch to tamper with those button ... very few of we do -rrb-  now the bad ... the sound output be limit to headphone plug ... and all the bad review that this system get ... in all the site that contain this system 's review almost 50 % complaint about fault within the first warranty year ... and the fact that you can not find ANY information on this system on Samsung website be a definite sign that this system be troublesome -lrb- it be a new system , while samsung have some older system still be support on they site -rrb- ... luckily so far I have no problem at all with my system  so I guess when you decide to buy this system , even though it be a very good one for the price , in the end you really have to ask yourself if you be feel lucky : - -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	Staticy \/ teapot whistle constantly . do not support blu ray live on any disc I have try . Netcast be nice and work well , but I buy this primarily for sound and that it do poorly .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	if anyone know how to connect a pc to this receiver , then let I know ... there be only 2 input -lrb- one analog -rrb- and one supposedly digital , but the digital optical imput will not connect into my pc spdif for sound , so I can not run sound from a pc through the receiver . what be worse be that the speaker be all run off the power subwooffer , so it only will support this receiver ... really upset with this purchase consider they never provide a upgrade patch ...
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	when i first hook it up and test it , it sound a little weak , but i go through the menu and everything be turn down , like the volume for the speaker and subwoofer , once i put it up the sound be amazing , the bass come from the woofer seem like a 100 watt system rather than a 70 . i reccommend this for any room small or large , you will not be dissapointed especially at this price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be look for a home Theater in a box solution that be minimalist in appearance , without compromise on sound quality or available feature . I try the bose 3-2-1 system and cinemate speaker prior to this . I end up return both the product . for about $ 500 less , Yamaha deliver amazing sound quality in a very small footprint ! I highly recommend this product for apartment dweller or someone who appreciate minimalism . pro : - 3 hdmus input + 1 Analog - solid Build Quality + Yamaha reputation - one-of-a-kind receiver that have a built-in subwoofer - great price & fast shipping on amazon.com CONS : - the speaker bar sometimes block the infrared port on the tv , thereby make it difficult to use the tv remote . -lrb- this be really not a con , as you can dismount the leg to lower the height or position the speaker appropriately -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	buy this product last month and it have be work out really great . all cool feature and easy set up . only thing be Wireless Internet do not go well with g router so I end up have wire connection and it be work flawlessly since then . Netflix , Youtube , Pandora etc. . . work wonderfully . about wireless speaker they be still wire but not connect directly to the main speaker . so you do not need to run the wire through the room but still rear speaker need to be connect to the device which will communicate to the Blu ray player . so far,s-air be work out good . I be yet to test 3d . will update comment once I get it test . overall , great product , great feature and great price .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I be excite by all the feature offer in this unit for the price , but live with it have leave I feel otherwise .  1 . weak weak weak remote . point directly , push repeatedly , and maybe it 'll work . Buttons be tiny , not light , etc  2 . lowest volume too loud ! how can a product be make like that ?  3 . amplifier dead after 3 month of light use . I be call the company tomorrow , it be get a 1 year warranty , but I be not hopeful . even if they ship a replacement , I do not think I want it ! ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	save yourself the headcahe , find another system . all movie I have try to view on this sysyem have shut down midway . think that all my movie -lrb- which continue to play on my other dvd player -rrb- be either dirty or scratch , I have buy new movie with the same annoying result . too late for I to return this thing that I buy in 1\/07 .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	Audiovox dv1201 5.1-channel dvd home Theater System
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I purchase this home theater system base on good review on CNET , and the fact that it would be pair with a Sony lcd tv -lrb- which be also faulty-another story -rrb- . BIG MISTAKE ! the sound be not a big improvement over the tv speaker , would not read any dvd -lrb- keep say no disc -rrb- , no radio reception , hard to control with cable remote , and when I would get disgusted enough to get rid of it , could not even use the darn speaker elsewhere because of proprietary connector . the Sony `` customer service '' person , in goodness know what country , be of no help , and want my credit card number to initiate a repair order , since the product be a couple of month out of warranty . no way be I give they another cent of my money or another minute of my time . somebody kick in the rear if I ever look at another Sony product .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	o no warranty ; no address or telephone number in packing material . try 800\/726 -3801 . o 90 day warranty . unit die after 9 month . o work only with remote control supply ; no universal remote code so now I have one more clicker to kepp track of o tiny speaker supply with unit have a tinny sound ; fortunately receiver easily drive my ancient Rectilinears . also on the plus side sound level be separately adjustable on each channel . on the down side , a built-in cross-over network mean you can not eliminate they sub-par power-consuming biamped subwoofer . o if you switch from dvd to tv , dvd revert back to start of disk . a major pain as now you have to sit through a minute plus of start-up material . o you can not remove dvd 's until you switch back to dvd mode , wait a minute for warmup o almost impossible to navigate through mp3 's . o lack a mute button . oh thos enoisy commercial o Number key can not be use to select dvd chapter . o could use extra audio input for tape deck and reel-to-reel . o lack digital input for PlayStation , etc. .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	this be a complaint about the Panasonic sc-ht733 home theater system . this system repeatedly shut itself off for no apparent reason . Panasonic have I take it twice to a local electronic store under warranty but they be unable to fix it . I ultimately return it through the merchant and buy another brand . I will never buy any Panasonic product again , not because it be defective , but because of the way Panasonic address the problem . it be a big problem to disconnect everything and take it in while they perform trial and error . Panasonic should have just replace it . I do not like the attitude of anyone I speak with there . I also be not even able to complain directly to the company . on the phone they give I a case number and never follow up . a online feedback form do not work . I be through with this company .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	thats right , a home theater package in one box . I start look for a home theater system around the holliday . in the paper , magazine , on the web , and in the store . with all different kind of model and size its hard to decide what right for you . finally I decide I would just start with a simple home set up and improve from there because I do not want to pump a bunch of money in a electronics package that be too expensive or just overwhelming . I come across radio shack look for a new phone and think I would just check they out . to my astonishment they do . I download the pdf file of the manual with the spec -lrb- I will not go into all of those -rrb- and price for comparison to other system . I be also get a game console that have a dvd player -lrb- since I do not own one I could kill two bird with one stone -rrb- and want the best sound I could get without take out a loan . after look around I decide to get this system because I do not have to worry about separate multiple piece , most small system do not even have 500w , and for the money if I do not like it then I could take it back or give it to someone as a gift : - -rrb- upon inspect the system I find it fairly easy to set up . the line be color code to the specific speaker and the manual be pretty self explanitory . my wife want the speaker to be mount up on the wall -lrb- they have a service for that as well -rrb- so it be put in we den\/kitchen -lrb- call a morning room -rrb- and though the speaker look a little big they look fine after be install -lrb- ceiling be at least 12-15 ft high -rrb- . let I tell you that the sound that this system produce be truly wonderful if you be look for a starter or even and intermediate package this be it . Game playing be great , movie be like be at the theater -lrb- never go back to vh -rrb- , and if you have a party or small gathering this baby can do very nicely . even at 200w for the subwoofer it will not pack the punch you may be look for . it will not shake the wall or give you the deeeep bass like the club or a great theater but , be still nice and get the job . you can add another -lrb- shield -rrb- sub though to the reciever if you like to give you a little more umfff . I dare you to find a better system at this price ... do not bother because you will not ... I have already be do that road .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	there be a rather annoying problem regard the a\/v input which I initially think be originally a defect in my particular unit . however , it seem to be a problem with all t-352 model . when the function be set to Audio\/Video , the subwoofer rumble rather annoyingly , even when nothing be plug into the input . if you plug anything into the input , the sound still remain , and the only way to get rid of it be to set the bass volume to 0 . I do not know if it be a problem with the subwoofer or if it be just a feature , but the sound be nice and clear -lrb- with no low rumble -rrb- when play a cd or dvd directly through the unit . if you plan to connect you video game console or computer to these speaker , however , do prepare to be annoy .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this hybrid sound bar and home theater system have excellent sound and fill a average room with every detail . it sound as if you be within whatever be on you tv . however , Vizio forget about important detail when make this system . the remote be cheaply make and feel like it will break easily . a fully wireless system would eliminate setup frustration . you also need to make sure the wire be fully connect or you will not obviously have full sound . however , the system be a good deal for its price and sound great .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	look ... 1 . I do need a good quality home Theater 2 . Dolby Digital , 5.1 ch 3 . for a little room -lrb- 5 meter square -rrb- 4 . low price -lrb- if you compare about the dvd+amplifier+speaker -rrb- 5 . VCD function to play my home video -lrb- burn in a pc -rrb- 6 . strong volume but not enough to have problem with the neighborhood -lrb- and my wife -rrb- 7 . with a in-plug for the VCR .  then I compare the price for a home Theater like Sony 875 with multus IN\/OUT 's , speaker system with 500w or more ... but it be near four time more expensive ... then I return to the list above and finally my taste and my wallet be satisfy . the davs500 be excellent for a little room and for a dvd\/vcr system ... that be all ... if you want to play music you be wrong with this equipment . the sound for a dvd be a Sony sound . . clear and perfect , but if you wanna play cdmusic you will understand that Sony doen ' t want you have a sound-video system in one , it look like the system switch the sound quality if you play a dvd or a cd ... Wanna play music ?? , buy a sound system Wanna play a dvd movie ??? ... it be perfect with this machine .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	customer service - the Panasonic website claim this be very important to they . I have my home theater only 3-4 month when a VCR tape get stick . I have now be at the service center for almost 4 month ! when I be lucky enough to get a response from Panasonic -lrb- which be rare -rrb- , they make promise of completion and\/or replacement . but promise will not play the dvd 's my family would have like to watch together over the holiday . when we finally get through to the customer service center on the phone , they have the nerve to hand up on we twice . if you want a COMPANY to stand behind THEIR PRODUCTS - stay away from PANASONIC !!! I have truly give up hope of even get my home theater back from the Panasonic service center .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I think I would upgrade from the Vizio 2.1 soundbar , which perform well . my first vht510 last about three week before the blue volume , etc. , led stop work . the sound quality , in my opinion , be spectacular for the price . because the indicator light provide the only visual feedback for the various setting available , I return the unit to Amazon . the replacement unit work perfectly when I set it up . however , when I turn the unit on the next morning , I find that the subwoofer lead indicate it be not connect to the sound bar . the soundbar 's wireless function appear to have fail . two different Vizio technician be unable to to correct the issue over the phone . since this be a replacement unit from Amazon , I decide to send the defective unit to Vizio in hope that whatever problem be associate with the unit will have be correct in its replacement . we 'll see !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	SET up take 15 minute . I place the 2 inch tall sound bar on my tv stand . I do not attach the foot because it would be so tall it would block the power button of my 42 inch LG TV . I put the subwoofer on the floor , until I get a new tv stand with shelf . I twist off the cap for 6 speaker wire that go into the sound bar and the other 6 wire that go into the subwoofer . I be use to speaker wire from set up my old stereo . only the subwoofer have a electrical plug , a plain one , not the blocky one . all the input & display be on the subwoofer . I connect a hdmus cable from the Comcast DVR & another HDMI cable from the subwoofer into the tv to convey the picture , which pass thru the Yamaha unit . the Yamaha be receive Dolby Digital from Comcast . I turn off the tv 's speaker . if you wish more audio input than the one provide by Yamaha , search Amazon for `` tosklink audio selector '' I have my HP desktop pc connect with hdmus to my tv for streaming , but when connect to the Yamaha , my computer screen go blank . so , I keep the HDMI cable in my tv for picture , and connect a toslink audio cable from the pc to the Yamaha . the Yamaha be receive PCM sound from my pc -lrb- from the internet -rrb- but not Dolby Digital . the subwoofer be also a FM receiver . after I connect the little antenna cord , I be able to receive 10 or 11 radio station . use could not be easier . I turn on the Yamaha unit . I turn on the tv . -lrb- edit : with the Yamaha , my Comcast HD DVR box reset from 1080i to 720p so rather than reset Comcast cable box , I put hdmus from cable box to TV & Toslink audio cable from cable box to Yamaha , so tv stay 1080us and when need , I switch Yamaha 's audio input to the computer 's audio cable -rrb- . and , then , like always , I change the channel or volume or access Comcast 's on demand or dvr . if I want to use it with the computer , then I press `` tv '' on the Yamaha remote -lrb- because the Yamaha 's audio input be be use with the pc -rrb- . if I want to listen to FM , I press the FM button . I could not get the Comcast remote to control the Yamaha , but the Yamaha 's remote be wonderfully small and simple . performance be great . nobody should expect it to replicate the sound of huge & powerful individual speaker , or to hear surround sound , but it be a wonderful improvement from the tv 's sound -lrb- which sometimes be very good but not always -rrb- . from all source -lrb- tv , FM or PC -rrb- , sound from the Yamaha be always excellent ! I have have it for more than 2 week now and not be disappoint . test from YouTube video , the sound bar have separate leave , center , and right sound . the subwoofer 's bass be very good . the Yamaha 's FM radio be very good . from the pc , YouTube movie & tv soundtrack sound great thru the Yamaha . the Yamaha be enjoyable and fun to use . -lrb- edit : I see Yamaha have a 494 model , on Amazon & Yamaha 's website at they home theater in a box gallery , with 2 rear speaker , but they must be wire as not wireless -rrb- I highly recommend the Yamaha 400 sound bar .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	we buy this system about 4 month ago when move into a new place . when compare it to higher price Sony model and whatnot , we find this one to have the most and best feature for the most reasonable price .  Pioneer be well know for its high standard in audio quality and be probably one of the best in the industry . it have 5 speaker plus a subwoofer . the speaker be back right , back left , front right , front left , and one that go on top of you television . the overall appearance be very impressive . the subwoofer can either stand up or lay on its side , which ever you prefer . we decide to put it under the couch to create a more realistic and captivating effect .  the dolby digital encoding in this thing be superior . for example , in a movie a car could be drive from the left of the screen to to the right and the sound of the automobile will actually seem to move across you room because of the effect the speaker produce . it be as if you be actually in a theater . very deep clear sound . we preview many different home theater system from best buy and other electronics store and this one be by far the best . it have a cleaner , crisper , deeper , more resonant sound than other model such as the more expensive sony . no hiss or click sound like the other produce because they can not handle the amount of sound . also , it have ton of different preset theater surround sound you can pick from to give you dvd the best sound possible . some of they that I can remember off hand be Action , Drama , musical , virtual Surround 1 , Virtual Surround 2 -lrb- my favorite -rrb- , and there be many many more that I can not remember right now .  another feature that make this model superior to its competitor be that it be all in one unit . the receiver and 5-dvd changer be all in one so you do not have to worry about the bulk that other system cause . this be especially helpful if you live in a small place or a apartment ... or if you just do not want alot of equipment take up alot of space . we have ours in a small stand with a VCR and Playstation 2 and everything fit just fine . also , if you be worry about the 5-dvd changer ... I have have some in the past that have break , but this one be incredibly smooth and do not glich at all . Superior workmanship .  one of the best thing about this system be that you can run anything through the surround sound system . we go to RadioShack and buy some extra cord and be able to connect we VCR and Playstation 2 through the surround sound system . you would not believe the effect this thing produce . it be amazing . when you can not rent something on dvd , you can rent it on VHS and still get the same surround sound effect . there be probably even a way to hook the actual tv through the system , but we have not figure it out yet , or we have not buy the right cord . but it do have a tv option , so I be sure that you could .  another thing that I must add in be the amazing quality of video . this dvd system produce crystal clear picture . you can definitely tell the difference between a movie in my Sanyo VCR and a dvd in my Pioneer . also , I use to have a Panasonic dvd player prior to this purchase , and the Pioneer look 10 time better . very clear . great color balance and depth . amazing .  Pioneer definitely take a step up with this home theater system . the all around package be just incredible . the $ ... you be spend be definitely worth it . especially since some of the higher price model do not even have many of the feature or sound capacity that this model pack . we already know Pioneer be great with sound , and now the Video capability open up a whole new world of Home Theater Entertainment .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have have this soundbar for almost a month now and want to spend a good amount of time listen to it before I write up a review . for the price this be a awesome soundbar . the setup be easy and quick ; for some reason I expect the subwoofer to be wireless too , but no biggie . the soundbar itself be a-lot smaller than I have initially expect , I know it be thin but I do not expect it to be that thin . the sound that come out of those small driver be bigger than I expect too . the subwoofer + receiver be nice and convenient but do not plan on expand you sound system with it . the subwoofer and soundbar be paired nicely , the bass be generally where it should be . I have have a Sony home-theater-in-a-box which have bass that be muddy and overwhelming , this be a pleasant change . the subwoofer level be adjustable too which be very convenient for movie . tv : compare to tinny sound tv speaker , this do a awesome job . there be a big spectrum of sound tv speaker just can not produce and this Yamaha setup do a good job of fill that in . the sound be good , voice can be a little nasal sound but it be not super noticeable . the Uni-Volume feature be a big plus , it crunch some of the dynamic range but work as intend keep the commercial at the same volume as the show you be watch . movie : in term of immerse you into the movie , this system do a good job . I use the Extended Stereo mode which the make the sound more room filling -lrb- work well for tv too -rrb- . however I do not use the Surround Sound mode , you need a small living room with wall relatively close to the soundbar for this to really work at all . I try it but thanks to the wall be so far away the sound be scatter and not well image . music : this be a little bit disappointing , I be expect music to perform as well as tv or movie do but it just do not . I listen to elbow 's album `` the seldom see kid '' and immediately notice a lack of clarity and imagery in the sound . there need to be more instrument separation and overall just more definition . I be expect it to be a little bit better than it be . but this come from someone who own a pair of Sennheiser HD650s and have a pair of swan m200mkiii for he computer audio setup , if you be not a audiophile you will not notice . conclusion : for a quick and easy home theater setup , this do a pretty good job . there be nothing that it really do not do well , music be a little disappointing but it still do alright . however this system can not defeat the law of physics ... even though the sound be room filling , you can still tell it be come from tiny speaker . if you have a big living room , do not expect this soundbar to do that well , you need BIG speaker for BIG and FULL SOUND . a pair of floorstander or bookshelf speaker will do much better , even if you have a small living room . for a soundbar though , this be a nice setup from Yamaha .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I set this up as a secondary home theater system in my home . although not as detail as my main system , I be very surprise by the sound quality for the price . excellent for movie , but a bit harsh for pure music listen for my taste . the sub could be a little more refine , but it be adjustable . if you be look for decent movie sound on a limited budget , I do not think you can go wrong here .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	very please with this product . very easy to setup , and the integrate subwoofer\/tuner save a ton of space . all component can fit within exist tv stand , minimize clutter . sound be great . will not compete with a true-surround setup , but the point with this product here be to get as close to that without run wire or spending over $ 500 . would recommend to anyone look for a simple , affordable and quality set up for a single room set up . the optional ipod cable be a complete waste of money , can not believe they expect someone to shell out $ 60 for it ... I opt for a $ 2 aux out cable instead , and it sound great .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the Samsung ht-c6600 be a great product for the price that I get it for . some review give it a low rating because of the sound . I think that the sound sound great and that that it be clear and crisp enough for I . I be not a audio file so it could be just ok for some . I think that it be a great start if you do not have a system now . one issue that I do have be connect it to my exist Linksys 54GWRT Wireless Router for Steaming Internet and Computer file . I have recently purchase a new Wireless Router because my Linksys be go on 4 year . hopefully , that will fix the issue . good buy and I would recommend it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	excellent product , easy set-up , solid remote , quality finish , beautiful sound ... the audio easily fill we 450sq foot tv room . we use the product with we Sony 55 inch lcd . I have yet to figure out how to sync the Sony remote with the system . however I can not complain Yamaha produce superior product !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	the 5 dvd changer be great . the sound quality be above what you would expect from a system of this cost level . a little light on the high end I feel but really depend a lot on you sound source as well . some say they think the bass be weak but I find if I put the sub-woofer box on it be back point up to the ceiling I get great bass . more than I want . Speaker placement be everything . try several different placement and hear the difference . all in all I be very happy except I wish the high be a little more tinkly .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	get it at Circuit City for $ 120 ! lot of bang for the buck . Plays almost all type of dvd and cd out there . so it be get only one audio input -lrb- and rca at that -rrb- , the 200w be more than enough for a medium size room .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	the main unit have a slick , slim design . the speaker be solid look . all the need cable be include , and everything be color code and label . then I turn it on .  First , whenever power be apply , or mode -lrb- disc\/tuner\/aux -rrb- change , a disturbingly loud `` klunk '' noise be make . the unit always power up in disc mode , and will not respond for several seconds while it try to load a disc . setting -lrb- such as volume -rrb- be often lose or different when change between mode . many function be not available in all mode . for example , `` mute '' only work when play a disc . the equalizer only apply to audio cd . and so on .  i find I have to wait one or two seconds after press a button before the unit respond . if I press additional button before the unit be ready , it sometimes do not respond , or do the wrong thing .  sometimes , while change between mode -lrb- e.g. , from radio tuner to aux in -rrb- , the disc tray would eject a inch or so out of the unit , and then stop . this be especially ironic give that the eject button do not function unless you be in disc mode .  audio and video artifact -lrb- pop , click , on-screen flash , etc. -rrb- occur when navigate dvd menu .  worst of all , the unit lock up several time play dvd . the picture would corrupt , then everything would just stop . I have to unplug the unit , and then plug it back in , to get it to respond again . this happen on several different dvd , include a brand-new , just-opened disc .  i return the unit to the store . I be not expect much , but this model fail to meet even basic expectation .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the product be awesome , no complaint about how it work and sound but be careful , this be not a 100 % wireless system . I think it be from what I read but ... surprise !! you will still have run cable behind you couch !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be really please with this system . I buy this for a office in my house so I be look for something small , cheap and high quality . there be a combination that you do not find often . you certainly do here though . the receiver itself be quite small as be the speaker . setup be very easy . each speaker cable have a color code connector so it be pretty hard to get wrong . the length of cable for the front 3 speaker be fine though I have to add some extra for the rear speaker . the main selling point for I be the fact that this unit have 3 hdmus in . it allow I to connect my cable box , Mac Mini and match Sony Blu Ray player and switch between they very easily . I find no other system in this price range that have the diverse in and out that this have . one thing that concern I be whether or not the remote code would work with my Verizon Fios box . none of the build in Sony code work , but the auto scan feature find a matching code pretty quickly and it work great . it so nice to only have to use one remote 95 % of the time . I be pleasantly surprise by the sound of this system . I be not say it be go to please the serious audiophile out there , but for its give purpose , it be excellent . I would actually say that the surround decoding be supperior to the far more expensive system I have attach to my primary tv setup . the only knock I can give this thing be that it have very few physical button or knob . almost everything have to be do with the remote . this , in and of itself , be fine . it make setup a bit of a headache though . there be lot of drill through menu to find what you be look for . you should only need to do this once though and the menu be logically organize - just time consume to sift through . overall , for $ 199 ship , I really could not be happier . I would recommend this system to anyone . it would even work fine as a primary system as long as you understand that its not that $ 1000 system you have have you eye on .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I be not expect amazing sound quality . the sound quality be acceptable for what it be . I be incredibly disappoint that I can not run my WDTV Live through the receiver . I guess the video do not pass through ? I do not know . if I be not so lazy I would return the unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	this be my first home theater system and it sound great . it be easy to set up and connect the speaker . the reciver be limit on its feature but it sound great when watch suround movie . the only drawback be the system do not sound good when listen to just music .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	flat out the best system at this price . the sound quality be just what you would expect from JBL . have the 5 disc changer make it perfect for party ... . set the CD 's in the player and just let it do it be thing . the compact speaker will surprise most people when they first see the small size , but the sound that come out of they will blow they away . more option than I can even go into -lrb- i. e : DSP imaging , sleep timer , dvd option -rrb- . get it and enjoy .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	not a big reviewer guy , but after read all the negative review on this item , figure it be my responsibility . the Vizio surround system be awesome . amazing sound from a center bar , sub and satellite . I be honestly amaze you can pay less than 500 buck for something that plug into you tv , no amp , no receiver , and it sound this good . watch the world series sound like I be sit in the stand . there be even a drunk guy over my right shoulder yell `` let 's go Rangers . '' maybe other have older model before they fix the led or whatever , but this thing be awesome .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	nice little system I pick up from Sears as a open box item . Easy to operate , put together and use right away . decent sound and function as expect for my current need ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	customer service - the Panasonic website claim this be very important to they . I have my home theater only 3-4 month when a VCR tape get stick . I have now be at the service center for almost 4 month ! when I be lucky enough to get a response from Panasonic -lrb- which be rare -rrb- , they make promise of completion and\/or replacement . but promise will not play the dvd 's my family would have like to watch together over the holiday . when we finally get through to the customer service center on the phone , they have the nerve to hand up on we twice . if you want a COMPANY to stand behind THEIR PRODUCTS - stay away from PANASONIC !!! I have truly give up hope of even get my home theater back from the Panasonic service center .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	very nice system once you play around and tweak the setting . I buy this to supplement my awful tv speaker . I be a bit annoyed with how high you have to turn the volume up to really hear the roundness of the system . and my biggest problem be the add on speaker Onkyo sks-22x -lrb- center + surround -rrb- I guess this be a problem with Amazon.com not carry the add on speaker . I have be search high and low to locate the add on speaker without luck . and it seem you can only get the add on package from Europe after spend a crazy shipping cost , who want to do that . so I wish Amazon would start supply these add on speaker please . overall not a bad little package for the buck .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	if you be look for a entry level speaker\/home theater setup , buy these . you will not be disappoint . clean crisp sound at a great price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I purchase this system three week ago along with a 60 inch plasma television . I be not sure what the other viewer be look for with this system , but I be absolutely enjoy it and my family and friend love this system also .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	need something to compensate for my Samsung lcd 's less than ideal acoustic . simple to setup , unobtrusive , great separation , rich complex timbre . yes , the light indicator do stop work after a few day , but so what ? you listen for sound change , rely on visual signal be redundant .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I have a little trouble hook it up to the television . I have to call tech support a we get it hook up to my direct tv cable box a it work just fine ! clear sound a everything .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I purchase a Samsung HT-DM150 Home Theater System to complement the Samsung 27 '' hdtv I have get for my bedroom sit area . it be a great compact system for a compact room . I would not recommend use it in a large room , but it certainly provide enough power for a small room . the manual be adequate , but could provide a little more detail . connect and configure the system be straightforward and very easy to do . once everything be up and run , I proceed to test the system out . the picture quality through the component cable be exceptional and the sound be clean with little perceptible distortion . the system easily handle the various dvd I throw at it and be able to provide volume level a lot higher than I expect . the remote control leave something to be desire , but most oem remote do . still , the machine be everything I have want and I do not have to shell out a lot of cash to get it so I be very happy and very imporessed with Samsung . unfortunately , my enjoyment of the system do not last long . apparently , the unit run extremely hot and the fan may not provide enough cooling . around 1.5-2 hour into watch dvd , the system refuse to display a picture on the screen . the unit be very hot and the fan apear to have stop . only after I turn the power off and then turn it on again , do I receive a picture . I have read about this issue when research the product , but think it might have be correct . guess I be wrong . the unit I have be not enclose in a cabinet , but lie on a open shelf expose on all four side , so it be not a issue of improper ventillation . I plan to take a look at the fan and see if there be some way I can fix it myself before return it to the store for a replacement or store credit . I hope there be a solution , because frankly , I would hate to have to shell out more cash for a system that do half of what this one do . to sum it all up , for the price , the feature can not be beat . just be aware the unit do run rather hot and you may have some issue with the unit not work . if Samsung address these problem , they 'll have a killer system . so 2 star because of the low power and poor reliability as a result of cooling . if not for the cooling issue , I would give the Samsung ht-dm150 at least 4 star .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy this for a small 1br apartment and it be everything I could ask for and more . I spend a long time compare Home Theatre Systems and choose this one because it have the most feature at a reasonable price point . I have a Sony Bravia 32 '' that connect to the stereo system and that make it very easy to control volume and power on\/off the system and tv together use the original tv\/cable remote . the three HDMI port be great for CABLE , PS3 , and a extra port to connect my laptop , and when the system be off the pass-through option allow you to continue use you tv as if the system wasnt connect . the speaker and sub woofer sound great and I love the auto-calibration mic , it make everything very simple . there be more than enough wire for front and rear speaker , the center speaker cord be a little small , and the gauge be just the right size to be hide from sight under carpet and around wall . the hts-s370 be a great buy and make play video game and watch tv and movie more enjoyable . pro : great sound , lot of wire , easy setup con : none ! note : I be not too sure why , but I use lcpm on PS3 and still my video game play in 720p not 1080p
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	good sound from a budget system - only flaw be I could not get the hdmus to work , have to connect use analog video cable . first unit I buy have a defective dvd player , Amazon swap for a new unit with any cost to I - very pleased with Amazon 's service !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this system be definitely a good value for those want to add home theater in a small room . it be worth keep in mind that this system do not have as much power as higher-priced system , and the speaker and remote be make of a somewhat cheap-looking plastic . that say , it do a great job of fill the living room of my one-bedroom apartment .  where this system fall short I think be in its ability to handle music on audio cd . for some reason , no matter which setting I try -lrb- regular stereo or tweaking it with Dolby pro Logic -rrb- audio cd sound flat and lackluster . the problem seem to be that the include front speaker be very small and do not do a good job handle the mid-range common in rock music . the subwoofer tend to dominate and create a muddy effect . I plan to replace the front speaker with a better set , but this be slightly complicate by the non-standard connector on the back of this system -lrb- a plug instead of the usual `` pincher '' -rrb- .  the dvd player be first-rate . the picture quality be outstanding and I particularly like the quality of the picture when scanning -lrb- fast-forwarding -rrb- -- something which a lot of dvd player do not do well . set up and operation be also a real breeze . this system be much easier to use than some other that I have try .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be a steal at $ 199.00 . I purchase this system as a gift for my mom . this be a awesome system for someone who want surround sound but do not want a sub woofer that be go to rattle the wall . I can not believe the clear and well balanced sound that come out of the speaker . we hook up a dvd player and dish receiver to the system . if you use a optical cord , you do not have to switch the receiver back and forth to the dvd player and dish receiver . the switch be automatically do . all and all if you look for a excellent system and do not want to spend a lot of money , this be the one to get !!
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I have own this dream system for 3 year , and have have continuous trouble with it . first malfunction be when the unit 's disc eject mechanism break . second malfunction be when the unit start to experience startup trouble and would repeatedly cycle through its power-on\/power-off sequence . the latest malfunction involve a annoying high-pitched whine emit from the speaker when the unit be play in Video 1 or Video 2 mode . unlike other owner who experience this problem , I be not willing to open the casing and poke around at the unit 's innards . I be just feed up with this system and would discourage any prospective buyer from consider this unit or any future model brand Sony dream system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	well the panasonic hometheater system sound be great and the picture be great , however the pop sound only appear when i play my vanilla sky , matrix reload and l.a. confidential dvd 's . the first 2 dvd title show a small amount of pixellation ... there like little color square that appear for less than a sec and sometimes interrupt sound but not everytime i play the disc .  i try those dvd 's on my sony dvd player and the disc be perfect . no scratch , no fingerprint , no pixellation and no dust . my l.a. confidential dvd never play well with the panasonic system , with the sony it be perfect . if someone can tell I why i get this little color square but the disc be perfect .  this panasonic home theater dvd really disappointed I when i play those disc , and how now what other dvd 's get those little annoying square and what annoy I the most be that they dont always appear on the same chapter , sometimes not at all and sometimes they do appear .   1 star for the problem , cuz the sound and picture be great but the little square really tick I off . be there something i can do to stop that from happen ?
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	nine month ago I think I be buy a good value product but now I realize that I buy a bomb ... the whole system stop work with a dvd inside . I could not manage to open the dvd ... worse , the service center that I be call do not work anymore ... do not buy from KLH never ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I buy it a couple of month ago after read all the good review . my expectation be probably too high for the price . just so so sound quality that you can get from auto speaker . again , not terribly bad consider money , but if you want nice home theater quality , I recommend invest a little bit more and go to other speaker set .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	the positive review of this system be not a fluke . this be a solid , inexpensive way to improve on tv speaker if you want better sound but do not want to spend a bundle on a sound bar or a real surround sound system . I say `` real '' because this be not a Dolby Digital 5.1 system , the current standard . there be three input , and all three be stereo -lrb- l\/r -rrb- input . what come out appear to be pro-logic , although I have not be able to confirm that in any of the spec . that say , by balance the speaker volume -lrb- you can independently control the volume for center , rear , front , and subwoofer channel -rrb- , you can get a nice , room-filling sound that allow for dialog through the center channel and music through all 5.1 , close enough to Pro-Logic for my limited need in this room . and bear in mind that most 2.1 system on here be not much cheaper . so why not opt for the extra speaker , even if they do not get discreet audio ? room-fill if you room be small , that be . I put this in a bedroom , which be nice thanks to its compact size . what be more , there be a remote , which the comparable Coby system -lrb- retailing here for $ 40 -rrb- do not have . the speaker wire length be generous enough for small room -lrb- and you do not really want this for large room -rrb- . and despite the towering picture , this be a small , very small , unit . the subwoofer can almost -lrb- though not quite -rrb- fit under the bed . all in all I give this 5 star as a worthwhile product for the price . obviously , up against true 5.1 system this do not measure up . but for $ 55 , you get -lrb- at least -rrb- what you pay for .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have a Logitech 5.1 system and need a basic mount that would match the style of the speaker while not look too obstrusive . these mount fit the bill . though the mount come with a variety of screw , bolt and fastener , I end up have to buy other which fit my particular speaker . I chalk that up to Logitech , not the mount themselves . once mount on the wall , I like the amount of adjustment that be possible with the mount . it help when you be look to direct the speaker at a particular spot . my speaker be small , say 4 '' wide by 6-7 '' high and 4 '' deep so the plastic mount do not seem to be under a lot of stress . but if you have larger or heavier speaker , I would look elsewhere . I recommend this product to anyone with smaller speaker !!!
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the five 2-way satellite speaker be really cool .  if you like movie , then then 50-watt power subwoofer in a front-firing bandpass will be you favorite . all speaker magnetically shield against video interference , so it be easy to find a good location around you living room .  subwoofer feature power switch and level control , plus line-level and speaker-level input , with feed-through to satellite  it be great for entry level .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	just like many other be complain the display stop work a few week before warranty expire . I do not have a chance to call tech support to get it fix and now they will not fix it . I think panasonic make good product and in fact they be on top of my list until now .
Vacuum	POS	5	I try 3 other brand return two and keep this one . the reason be it have more power and you can do at least 2000 sq with the thing versus the competition . I highly suggest it !
Vacuum	POS	5	I love this vaccuum cleaner , i buy it fro my honda odyssey & it work perfectly as i want . great product highly recommend .
Vacuum	POS	4	vacuum be excellent . a little on the heavy side like the other review say but a excellent value and plenty of suction . make you carpet stand right up . fast shipping and delivery make this a great transaction . excellent seller . would highly recommend both the vacuum and the seller . thanks
Vacuum	POS	5	amazing cleaning power - and I be pretty picky about cleaning -lrb- ask my better 1\/2 -rrb- . great vac for the price . suck up dirt that we previous vac never do . easy to clean filter - dry pretty quick . kid love to see the dirt after dad vac . very light and easy to drive . purchase after read review in lead consumer magazine - they be right . no reason to spend 4 or 5x this much on ANY vac .
Vacuum	POS	4	okay , first off , I be go to address the consistent note I have see in all the 1-star review of this vacuum . those folk all say that there be no suction power in this vacuum . nothing could be farther from the truth !! this little guy be actually lift my rear-seat floormat off the floor ! if that be not suction power , I do not know what be . the unit fold up nice and compact and fit with all its accessory into a nice black bag that go almost unnoticed in my trunk . on the subject of accessory , there be a couple of brush , a hose , and a adapter for the hose . if you have pet hair that have weave itself into you car 's cloth upholstery , you will need to use the brush attachment to get the hair out . that would seem to be common sense , but again , look at the negative review , I think some folk expect a 12-volt vacuum to just lift it out on its own . \* shrug \* it be very easy to clean , too , and it have a handle to turn to agitate the filter inside to keep it suck up detritus when the receptacle be \* almost \* -lrb- but not quite -rrb- full . empty the vacuum be a breeze , too ! the only reason I be not give this a 5-star review be because the 12-volt adapter sit very loosely in the 12-volt outlet in my car -lrb- all three of they -rrb- . I drive a american car . the 12-volt outlet have be standardized for some time , now . so , it be a little frustrating to have to play with the plug until I find where it will sit and not randomly become disconnect from the power , even though it look like it be still plug firmly in . all in all , though , a very good vacuum , and I would highly recommend it !
Vacuum	POS	4	great vacuum . do a good job cleaning and stand up to abuse very well . outlast and outperform other similarly price vacuum . great\/cheap vacuum that you can use for a long time , then replace when it finally die .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I agree with some of the other review about the product be make cheap . I think it do a great job on my carpet , but in just a few month , the foot pedal start pop off everytime I use it . without the foot pedal , the vacuum will not stay upright without fall over . I think this could be a great product with some minor change in the design , but I would be hesitant to buy this again . I have only have mine a year , and I be already look to buy a new vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	this vacuum be horrible . the battery life be about 5 minute and it take a long time to charge . it also do not suck good ! it be the biggest waste of money ever . this vacuum do not even deserve 1 star !
Vacuum	POS	5	order from Amazon , free shipping over $ 25.00 and the best price on the web . better yet i receive it the next day . I could not be happier .
Vacuum	POS	4	wow ! the suction be great on this vacuum and I love the minus attachment , it work great on stair . great price too . it be a great vacuum !
Vacuum	POS	5	I already own one Eureka Boss sweeper and decide to purchase another one so I could have one upstairs and one downstairs . I have a Kirby sweeper and wind up hate it . the Eureka Boss have powerful suction , and have the hose and attachment on board ready to go be wonderful . I have asthma , and my doctor also recommend it .
Vacuum	POS	5	the product meet the advertised claim . very handy on hard floor . a bit heavy but very manageable . really get under the bed easily and kill the huge dust bunny that live there . clean out easily . I would buy another without hesitation . would be very handy in a rv since it store compactly in the include charge stand and be powerful enough for light clean up on the carpet area .
Vacuum	POS	5	pricey . but worth it ! best vacuum I have ever own . quiet . Great for clean both wood and carpet floor , furniture , curtain . Easy to handle . it be pick up ton of cat hair and debris my other well-rated vacuum be miss . I love it !
Vacuum	POS	4	I take away a star due to not receive the advertised ` scent tablet ' which be the minor value add that lead I to pick this particular seller . however the bag themselves be fine . they have the cardboard collar as oppose to plastic , but it work . I have also try Filtrete , Crucial , Green label , etc. . they all work fine . in fact in 10 year of Miele ownership , I have only ever have 2 bag fail and they be both official Miele brand bag . as I have read on other review for the various bag , I agree it be hard to say if they all actually filter as much dust as Miele -lrb- or maybe even more -rrb- but I will say that I do not notice any residual dust inside the bag chamber regardless of which bag I have use -lrb- other the two previously mention Miele brand bag that fail -rrb- . base on all of this , in my experience , there be no reason to pay for the expensive , price-controlled Miele brand bag . the machine be expensive enough in the first place , and replacement part cost a arm and a leg . so save money on the bag !
Vacuum	NEG	2	after research consumer report , I buy the above captioned vacuum cleaner instead of buy another Hoover to replace my twenty-one year old machine . the Eureka come without its tool or wand . the yellow switch that be suppose to toggle between floor and carpet just flop , unattached to anything . the vacuum do a good job on the carpet , but I only have one carpeted room . it do not pick up anything from the bare floor , include Cherrios , rug fuzz which it throw off the carpet onto the floor , kitty litter or dust . and , yes , I do switch the indicator -lrb- not the yellow switch -rrb- from carpet to floor as the Eureka customer service rep. ask I . it be heavy -- on my scale , 23 pound , without the box . if I still have say box , I would return it this minute . I have not be able to try the hose attachment since the promise wand and tool have not arrive . I would not recommend this product to anyone .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have a older portapower-hoover and I recently buy a new one . it be great and the only thing I do not like about it be the new hose because it be too short and low quality . the old hose be longer and make well and I do not use the new one at all , my wife & I clean house so we use the Hoover constantly it be light and durable . Hoover should have keep the old hose . J.H.
Vacuum	NEG	1	I wish there be a no star option . we buy we boss about 10 month ago for light cleaning between the housekeeper come out . my wife complain after a week that it keep shut itself off so I take it apart and clean all the filter . I run it for a few minute and tell she it be fine now - do not think much of it . a week later she report the power paw stop work . a week after that she report the vacuum be shut itself off again . I clean all the filter -lrb- again -rrb- and give it back to she . the filter be not dirty , but I clean they anyway since it do the trick the last time . she say it be a pain and stop use the vacuum alltogether - go back to she old stick vacuum . fast forward several month - we now have a dog and it be time to break out the boss again . this time I take control -lrb- convinced my wife be do something wrong -rrb- . after apologize to she for think she be wrong , and apologize again for not return the vacuum while it be still under warranty I be now on a quest to buy a new vacuum . I be glad to read so many positive review - let 's see how those vacuum hold up after a few month of `` light housework '' . junk - very disappointed - very . I guess in some case you really do get what you pay for .
Vacuum	POS	4	I buy this little vacuum for my brand new car , and I have be quite pleased with it . a lot of people on here be compare the suction power to something more powerful , like a Shop-Vac , and that be a little unfair -lrb- this thing be only use a 12volt power source after all -rrb- . also , you be suppose to free up the vacuum 's filter every once and awhile by turn the dial on the side of the unit , and that help tremendously . this be great for people who simply want to keep they car clean - it be not mean for heavy-duty application .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have own this vacuum for a few year and I have find it to be the absolute best cordless vacuum . it hold its charge , it do not get clog -lrb- provide you clean out the filter regularly , and it have a good power level that allow I to do spot cleaning . we have adult child , grandchild , pet that shed , and even some messy adult in we household -- and this vacuum be perfect for clean up after they without have to lug out the big vacuum . I like this product so much that I just buy two more for my kid who be in college . in previous year they bring other version of cordless vacuum to they dorm , but they never last . I be confident that this little vaccum will do the job and even return home with they in May .
Vacuum	POS	5	after have go through a Oreck , a Hoover and a Dyson , I finally have a vacuum cleaner that have quality construction and control . I love the `` twist '' part , it make get into corner very easy . the hose be very easy to use -lrb- especially in comparison to the Dyson -rrb- . I be a little old lady with a very bad back . I have no problem use my Miele . it do a great job on get up pet hair and in this house a vacuum cleaner have to handle pet hair from two cat and two dog . I actually enjoy vacuum with my `` twist '' , my house have not be this clean in year . Revision I should have wait a while before write the review . the twist go through one bag perform well . it go downhill from there . I can not go over more than two square yard without a blockage . unstop this thing be ridiculous . there be three area where one can try , but it be virtually impossible to get a wire into the hole . trip to the repair shop be a inconvenience , but have to be do . I be very disappoint in this vacuum cleaner , wish I never buy it . 0
Vacuum	NEG	1	I have have this vacuum for about 1 year . I be look for a new one currently . I have have to purchase a new belt every month . I just eat they up . it wasnt bad at first but over time it have get progressively worse . this month alone I have go through 4 belt . I get so frustrated yesterday I just throw it in the trash .
Vacuum	POS	4	buy this product primarily for clean the car and small accident and job around the house . the cordless feature be a definite plus when do the car and quick job like vacuum a hard to reach corner , edge or books\/bookcases . it do a nice job of a dust off a bookcase that have not be clean in several month , but I find that empty the dust from the bin be not quite a open and shake operation . a bunch of the dust clump in the back of the collector bin filter do not empty out until I remove the filter and use a small brush to help it empty out . the vacuum be extremely portable and -lrb- for I -rrb- have a rather loud whinning motor noise . but I guess this be to be expect with a small vacuum with expose exhaust . Trumps the dustbuster I previously own with more suction and a hose feature .
Vacuum	NEU	3	its a great vacuum . although cord constantly come out of the volt socket . its a little lose and you have to be careful . other than that , its a great vacuum . do the job well .
Vacuum	NEG	1	it get hang up on everything , even where the floorboard be slightly uneven . it pick up mainly with the cleaning paper but I can not find much in the vacuum repository . sometimes it get in the middle of the room and stop for the longest time then start go in circle , all about the same size . I be not too happy with it
Vacuum	POS	4	the hose be pretty short and I always tip over the vac when get corner or window . it be on the loud side too . otherwise great and the heap filter be a must for kid and city with lead paint !!
Vacuum	NEU	3	I purchase my Carpet pro Cpu-lt February , 2011 . love it -- not too heavy and it do the job . it quit work in September , 2012 . I have never own a vacuum with such a short life , and I only vacuum about once a week . I be really disappointed .
Vacuum	POS	4	great vac for the price and power . could use a none strechable hose and better wasy of attach the cord . have a funny burnt smell when in use !
Vacuum	NEG	1	I wish I have listen to the bad review on here before I buy , especially consider what a pain it be to return a vacuum cleaner by mail . the first time I use it be ok . I be disappoint with the power , have to go over the carpet in the same place a couple time before it get everything . the 2nd time I use it , the attachment hose stop work . it be not block , it simply be not suck , and have not ever since . also , the bagless design be awful . it be near impossible to clean without make a mess . I be use to bagless vacuum and the extra work it involve , but this be just non-functunal . do not buy it .
Vacuum	POS	5	the Hoover Commercial Portapower Vac : I love this vac . I have shoulder problem and can not push a big vac . the suction on this be fantastic , the industrial cord super long . the reusable bag - very sturdy but the absolute best part be the click in component -lrb- not to downplay the suction -rrb- . the hose stay together . this be replace a Hoover windtunnel and a Eureka Boss upright for attachment cleaning as the hose on the windtunnel be too difficult to extend far and the Boss attachment would spring apart with any kind of tension . this be perfect for step , car , the laundry room and ceiling as you simply walk and suction . the one drawback be that I have a favorite horsehair brush attachment that do not fit due to they latch design but they provide more than enough attachment to make up for that . I wish consumer vac could produce such a sturdy hose system .
Vacuum	POS	5	these bag fit nicely into the Miele Canister . there be no plastic use , only cardboard , and the inventive `` enviro-closure '' be awesome at prevent dirt spilling out on bag change .
Vacuum	NEG	1	there be a problem with this vacuum cleaner just after 2 month of use . it have a lot of noise , you can not image the sound of it . it be also warm up easily . vacuum capability be ok but not great . it be heavy . I certainly not recommend this vacuum cleaner .
Vacuum	NEU	3	run with paper waste collection bag instead of the provide cloth bag make the unit very weak on suction . I would recommend a small square shop vac instead . such as ridgid 4.5 Gallon my Hoover arrive miss the follow part : 1 . bag 2 . belt to hold bag to bag support tube 3 . bag support tube the instruction be so poor , you might never figure out you be miss these thing and start use it without the paper bag .
Vacuum	POS	5	I already own a factory recondition version of this model , so I know it would be good go in . I need a second one for a second house . these baby deliver a huge bang for the buck . they use paper bag -lrb- cheaper to buy on Amazon -rrb- but its still cheaper and easier than clean a bagless hepa filter , which be expensive to replace every 6 month . and this vacuum really suck the carpet clean . my only disappointment be that it come without the `` power paw '' hose attachment , which I would have like to have . they tell I that the recondition unit do not come with those accessory .
Vacuum	POS	4	I buy this because of back problem , it be so easy and convenient to use . glad I make the purchase .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this thing work great at full charge ... so for about 5-10 min or so . then it start drop off pretty fast . I buy this about 2 year ago and I be pretty disappoint with the battery life . the other downside be it charge very slowly so it be not like you can use it for 10 min , charge it quickly then use it again . if I have a chance to do this over , I would by a cord unit .
Vacuum	POS	5	I get mine at Big Lots Dept Store . I pay $ 99.00 , and it be refurbish . this come with a full warranty . I have have it now for about 2 month . its a very basic no frill add vac . do a great job . now if I could just teach my cat to run it , I would have it make in the shade .
Vacuum	POS	4	this vacuum be one of the best vacuum I bring it move easily and pick up easy . these two thing be highly important to I consider I be in a wheelchair . I would prefer self propel but for the price you can not beat the way it move .
Vacuum	POS	5	I own my own cleaning business and this vacuum be a time saver on stair and hardwood floor . any high pill carpet though I have to use another vacuum for . light weight and great .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have have this vacuum for several month now and I love it ! the first time I use it I be horrify at the amount of stuff I could hear come out of my carpet . I love that I could actually hear it because it be such a quiet vacuum compare to most other -lrb- it be the quietest I have ever have -rrb- . in 10 year this be my fourth vacuum and I be in love with it . it be perhaps heavier than some but it be so easy to manuveur that I do not notice it be weight . the suction be wonderful and it do well on tile too which surprise I . some vacuum just blow the dirt around but not this one . the extension wand look like it would not reach far but it stretch to be very long . I can easily leave it at the bottom of we stair and reach up 8 stair or more . I would certainly recommend this vacuum .
Vacuum	POS	4	decent replacement bag and I have use many of these with no problem . I would have rate they at 5 star but they do have one small glitch . I believe these be originally design for older Bosch model with a elongate container\/bag compartment . the current model bag compartment be wider than long so that be the glitch . the Bosch bag be design for this and if you be look for a better fit , then I would choose that route . but for the price , these be a great alternative . in my opinion 20 bag at the same cost as 5 Bosch bag be worth it . they do fit fine and might hold a little less due to be lengthwise . instead of just insert the bag , I will open\/fluff it up and then insert it . it take all of about 10 seconds . if you just insert the bag , the bottom fold over and obviously it 'll affect how much it can hold . as a quick comparison Bosch bag sit sideways and these sit lengthwise . Hope that help .
Vacuum	NEG	2	this 4870mz machine clean very well , but I be not the least impressed with the cheap plastic part . the on\/off switch be cheap and have go bad cause the wire go to it to melt . it be a wonder it do not cause a fire . I would rather spend more money for a quality build machine that will last .
Vacuum	POS	5	great vacuum for the price . I be extremely pleased with this purchase . the vacuum have a great amount of power and the attachment provide make it possible to clean any surface . amazingly fast shipping as well .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be a really nice little vacuum , very versatile for small job . we use it on hardwood floor and well as rug and have pretty good suction power and be very easy to glide on carpet of rug when bristel be turn on ... seem that the rotate action help propel it forward . we seem to be vacuum more often give the size and portability . highly recommend for small job or apartment . the con I see be the capacity ... remember , this be not a big Vacuum , but as long as you do not mind empty it after each vacuum , you should be fine
Vacuum	POS	5	this little commercial vacuum cleaner be one of the best buy out there . I can clean up great Pyrenees hair with ease and empty out the bag and start over again with out clog up cleaner like other machine I have kill with dog hair .
Vacuum	POS	4	it be perfect product for the price I get it for . great suction power and do the job as advertise . my carpet look really clean after use this vacuum . I be really with this buy .
Vacuum	POS	5	the Black & Decker car vacuum be compact , plug into you car outlet , and do a good job of remove my dog 's constantly shed white hair . it come in a handy carry case , and store in the car easily . it be simple to put together and get the job do .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be one fantastic vacuum , I can go over the carpet several time and could not believe the stuff that come up . this be not a expensive vacuum but man oh man it really suck ... ... ... ... in a good way -lrb- ... -rrb-
Vacuum	POS	5	I order this vacuum base on consumer report , concentrate especially on its ability to pick up pet hair . it work marvelously . my rug be totally free of pet hair after I have vacuum . it be a bit heavy , but I can live with that . the attachment be simple to work , and it be easy to turn off the beater bar -lrb- for my more fragile handmade rug -rrb- . it be quiet , too . this be the best vacuum I have ever own . it come quickly and well package , and this be the best price I find anywhere .
Vacuum	POS	5	the moment I plug this vacuum in and turn it on , I love it ! I love the fact that I be not tug on a canister behind I all around the house . I can vacuum a entire floor from one plug because of the long power chord . the suction be excellent . the motor be relatively quiet . I like the small head for vacuum in small place . I would highly recommend this vacuum to anyone with hard wood floor .
Vacuum	NEG	2	buy this vac after read review and check consumer report site . the suction be terrific and it seem to be build by the Romans . it would likely be very suitable for a large house with thick wall to wall carpet . however , my house have hardwood floor with fringed area rug . the vacuum be so powerful that you have to be very careful around rug fringe and it be so heavy that it be very tiring to use on hardwood floor -lrb- although it offer this setting -rrb- . the foot pedal be extremely stiff which be very annoying , and the cord fastener -lrb- which pin down the last bit of cord when you wind it up for storage -rrb- be so stiff that it be unusable . I be search for something more suitable for my house .
Vacuum	POS	4	I really dig this little vac . it reach into space that would be inaccessible with any other hand vacuum I have see . it be very convenient to be able to set the canister down , or hold it in you other hand , as you vacuum -lrb- especially for door jamb and other place that require a reach -rrb- . I find it to be perfect for clean up my little apartment . after read other review , I expect the battery life to be worse than it be , though I do wish vac like this come with adaptor . I recommend it .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have be use Oreck Vacuums for year . I know that there be other vacuum on the market that look great and have a lot of hype , but forget they ! this be the best and it last forever . it be light , get under bed , easy to use , and clean great .
Vacuum	NEG	2	I can tell you one thing , it certainly do suck ! Ours last no longer than 6 month before we give up on it and throw it out . only a week or so after purchase this vacuum , it start make a awful buzz sound that would not go away regardless of how many time you clean it or remove debris from the head . most of the time it seem like it be just blow dirt around rather than suck it up . the front of the vacuum be constantly cover in dust and vacuum cleaner powder .
Vacuum	POS	4	I think maybe potential purchaser would like to know that the fhv1200 Flex Vac run for a little over seven minute continuously before the motor start to slow down and lose power . -lrb- never run a nicd power product completely dead , some of the battery cell will `` reverse '' and be permanently damage . -rrb- the time to fully recharge after run the vac this long be about 20 hour -lrb- figure a full day to keep it simple -rrb- . the charger be a small wall adapter type . I think the power be very good for a rechargeable vacuum -lrb- a little more than you average `` dustbuster '' -rrb- . as a example , it will easily suck up cat litter , small pebble , and pot soil , but will have trouble suck up a glass marble or penny . I do not think mine be too loud . it have that high speed `` whine '' sound combine with the sound of rush air , but the combination be somewhat muffle . it definitely do not sound weak . it almost sound like a corded vac . the fhv1200 smaller than you might expect , and the build quality be very good . I be not normally fond of black and Decker , but I like this little machine . ... and the blue led charge light be cool ! Minus one star because it take a looooong time to recharge ...
Vacuum	NEG	1	we get this vacuum because it have great review , and when we see the Amazon price it be a do deal . I like to vacuum and could not wait to use it . it be easy to put together . it be very light , so light it feel cheep . the cord be very short so you have to change outlet often . to clean the filter you have to put you hand up inside it and dust fly 's everywhere , and it be just gross . when I use it I could not even get it to pick up grass that have be track in . when you try to use the hose , everything fly 's out the back end all over the place . we think maybe it be just that unit , so we return it to Amazon -lrb- super easy -rrb- . they send we a new one right away . and same thing , nothing get suck up unless you have the time to go over each spot a dozen time . it be junk !
Vacuum	NEG	1	buy a vacuum , it quit work after one or two use , I have be tryint to contact the seller with get no response ! Super dissapointed with the seller !! they have be terrible to deal and still to date have not take care of the issue , Amazon have step in to make thing right .
Vacuum	POS	4	my wife and I have decide several year ago to go with a bagless model also make by Eureka . not a good idea , for we anyway . the dirt cup fill up quickly with we Golden Retriever 's hair and be constantly clog . when I decide to go back to this model that use bag I be a little bit skeptical thinking we be make a move backwards in ` clean technology ' . I be glad we do now though . we have have this machine for a couple of month and it be by far a better unit . this vacuum have not clog once in that time and even with we constant need to pick up West Texas dirt the bag be only about half full in that time . you do need to adjust for carpet height closely to maintain a good suction , but it be very simple to tell when it be not adjust correctly . my only concern have be with the light plastic construction on some part , but I guess that be the trade off you make for a lower price . we also buy the year supply of bag , filter , etc. and after see the retail price of bag around town , we be glad we do . if you do not want to spend the money on Dyson or another high dollar machine , this be a good choice .
Vacuum	POS	4	this be a powerful vacuum cleaner . the level adjustment and the attachment work great . it be pretty heavy and may not be a appropriate choice for those who need a lighter vacuum .
Vacuum	NEG	1	we return this vaccum . the hose be too long and will not stay in it be place . it flop all over while you be vaccume . -lrb- have to wind it around the front of the machine to keep it from come undo . -rrb- the attachment fall out of they place as well , so you be always fiddle with they and the hose . the cord get tangle up with the hose and attachment , so that be another thing you have to stop and fix  eureka 4870mz Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner  it seem to pick up well , but all the adjusting and fiddle negate that . not a user friendly item .
Vacuum	POS	5	after break my Dirt Devil bagless vac -lrb- no fault of it be own -rrb- , I have to find a new vacuum . what I favor about this vacuum be the easy release of the dirt chamber and the better filter design compare to the Dirt Devil . surprisingly , this vacuum be quite noticeably quieter than the Dirt Devil , yet do not seem to lack any power in comparison . I think at first it be weaker since it be so noticeably quieter , but that just be not the case . assembly be very easy , I recall only need to attach the handle with a single screw and it be pretty much ready to go ! I have be a Dirt Devil loyalist since my Dirt Devil Breeze be still run strong after 5 year before replace it with a new one , but Bissell have definitely impressed I with this one ...
Vacuum	NEG	1	it be great for a month or so but the battery keep get weaker and weaker . I throw it away . one star for longevity failure .
Vacuum	NEU	3	this vacuum cleaner be heavy to lift or move in another direction , it be cover with dust on bottom part of machine . it seem to pick up dirt very good but I use on my sofa where the pet hair be the worst but it do not do a good job at all . I do like it for a large area because it move by itself just when you change direction it be heavy . I like the attachment with it , so easy to use for sofa .
Vacuum	POS	5	I have have the Oreck XL2100RH Commercial for ten year now and think it be a great vacuum . I just buy a new roller for it on Amazon for a great price along with some belt . have to replace the fan housing assembly three year ago when the plastic crack , but it work fine now . just do not let the handle hit the ground too hard , I think that may be how I crack the fan housing . keep it clean around the roller and belt for optimum performance . it be amazing how fast dirt and pet hair will build . it do a great job on pick up pet hair . for the price , you can not go wrong .
Vacuum	POS	4	i have several cat in the house , wood floor and linoleum kitchen . the little vacuum work pretty good ... probably not good enough for the price . i would be more impressed if it have a swivel head . it do not blow the lint and hair around , but do actually pick up pretty good . it lack suction to pick up small particle of cat litter , but all in all be not bad . the charge only last about 10 minute , and would be nice if it last just a few minute longer . my square footage be about 1500 foot . i do love the cordless feature and it do fold up nicely to charge ...
Vacuum	NEG	1	I just throw away the Miele s7210 . it be less than a year old . the bag will not stay on the post to catch the dirt . the part of the cover be make of such cheap plastic they break off . it not worth the massive amount of money . DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT !!!!
Vacuum	POS	4	I be not impress when I start to assemble the vacuum , it seem a little flimsy , light plastic cover and the filter fall out at first . I be more impressed with the power and suction once I assemble and use it . this be a nice vacuum and do a good job cleaning . I have not use the attachment yet . I would buy this product again , it do the job and the price be very good . I have a commercial type Hoover prior to this purchase , I be use to good cleaning from a vacuum , this do not disappoint .
Vacuum	POS	4	I have have mine for about 2 year now and have drop it down we stair at least once , I routinely drop the handle wand thing on we concrete floor and basically do not baby the machine at all . it have have ZERO damage , apart from the baseboard paint scuff all over the container . this thing be build like a rock . the power head be annoy in that it `` skip '' when be pull backward on low pile carpet . I do not know if that be avoidable . the `` 3 speed '' on the vacuum be also annoy in that it default to the medium speed anytime you unplug . I will admit that there be rare instance where I will not want full suction , but hey who in the world do NOT wan the vacuum to suck at high power pretty much all the time ? that kind of annoy I . other than that , I love it , and I must say that it be worth the price . every other vacuum I have have have have moderate or complete damage after a few year . this be go strong . I do wish the cord be longer . of course it vary by one 's house size , but I always seem to need 10 more foot on the cord .
Vacuum	POS	4	we have have one for year , we need another one for the second floor as repeat haul up and down the stair have hurt the old one . I have purchase a huge stock of filter and bag for this model so decide to go with it - not to mention that it be still a consumer digest best buy . no issue whatsoever , it be probably a little noisy but we be use to it - have not owner another vacuum model in over 6 year . the additional accessory that have a roller attach to the hose be great for carpeted stair . you can not go wrong with this solid piece of machinery .
Vacuum	POS	5	Got this item recently , finally get to use it in earnest and it rule . do we bedroom today and get rid of dust and fuzz I could not believe be there -- the power paw accessory be excellent . it be get a spin brush head which be like a mini vacuum cleaner on a extension handle so you can get everything under you very awkward to move bed without have to move it . it be also the most powerful vacuum cleaner I have ever use . highly recommend .  eureka 4870mz Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner
Vacuum	NEG	1	this be the 5th vacuum I have ever own in my life . I have have it for 5 month now and absolutely can not stand it . it emit a high pitched shrill when in operation and be exremely loud . it give I a headache listen to it . it be annoy that it always switch into bare floor mode when upright . every single time I use it , I have to lean down and change it off bare floor to carpet . the release latch be difficult to engage & I can not do it just by a simple step on it . I have to lean down & pry it open with my hand . the power button be not conveniently located . it be on the main shaft , require the user to lean way down to turn it on rather than it be a simple flick from the handle . I also do not like the `` power paw '' attachment located on the very front top . it be constantly get knock off . I have not notice that be do any particular better cleaning than any other machine I have own . I definitely would not have purchase it if I have try it out in a store before-hand rather than get it on line .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I just purchase the Miele twist and I know how these review be important to I , so I hope that I can help someone esle who be consider the Miele s7 series -lrb- any model -rrb- . I research the motor as I be tell by the salesperson that the `` twist '' have a cheaper motor than the Salsa , etc. . this be not true . they all have the same motor - look at Miele 's website . the $ 100 difference be the filter and headlight . you can purchase the better filter and put it in the twist and have the same machine without the light . I debate on purchase off of the web , so I could save money . in my research I find that Authorized Dealers DO NOT honor the warranty if purchase from the web !!! so buyer beware . upon purchase and give it a test run , when I go to use the hose attachment it come out of the machine before I could even stretch it to full length , which be really not very far , if you like to vac high place - forget it . the hose attachment be much like a dryer vent . bottom line : the Miele twist be very easy to vac with and because it be on a petite side it can get to many little place and the swivel future be wonderful . it vacuum well , however , go over the same area with my old Riccar , I could hear it pick up debris that apparently the Miele miss . I think this machine be good , however , I think there be other that might be better for the price . I rate it a 3 star .
Vacuum	POS	5	though large and somewhat cumbersome , this fine piece of equipment be incredibly powerful and offer a good range of setting and extension . I be also able to find replacement bag very easily on amazon . two thumb up .
Vacuum	POS	4	have own it for several week now , so far so good . I be hear little thing get pick up that I have never hear before , and we vacuum somewhat regularly -lrb- at least 1-2x per week -rrb- . do not stink or smell like dust so the description of it be a good one for allergy seem to hold up . overall , a good buy for under $ 120 through amazon.com Retail price be closer to $ 200 , but then again , no store carry it within 30mus of we location .
Vacuum	POS	4	we have be very happy with the use of this product so far . my mom have one and have have some trouble with belt but we have not have any problem yet .
Vacuum	POS	5	this vacuum work PERFECT for hardwood floor and on carpet ! it be so easy to use and fold up for super easy storage ! I want to get a Dyson model but find out the battery would only last for 14 min when fully charge and do not work well on carpet . Consumer Reports also rate this model high and that be how I end up purchase this .
Vacuum	NEG	2	this be probably my fault for not read more carefully but I think this would be a good vacuum for my car , to clean the upholstery and floor as well as the mat . it be actually a mini size which would be ok for a computer keyboard but nothing else that I could use it for so needless to say , I be very disappointed .
Vacuum	NEG	1	get the previous version of this model -lrb- red pet vac -rrb- for christam last year -lrb- 08 -rrb- I live in a small apt and only vacuum about once a month . the vacuum already break . something happen to the brush , not the belt . the brush end up tear up the underside of the vacuum melting and shredding the plastic . now im stick use the hose to vacuum everything ! for the price -lrb- over $ 200 -rrb- be be definitely not worth it ! im very disappointed . try to get a refund or get it fix an customer service would do nothing for I . also the vacuum be very big and very very heavy . very disappoint with Eureka brand . look for a new vacuum at a affordable price but dont know which company to trust !?!?
Vacuum	POS	5	as the title say , for the price this be a great vacuum . my wife and I have a 2000 sq ft house that be mostly hardwood with some carpet . it clean on both nicely . when we get the dog she want , or the kid we both want I think we may upgrade . I might be totally underestimate this though . I have yet to see how it handle pet hair , or how messy my future kid will be . plus : the canister be easy to clean . there be a adjust knob for the floor type you be vacuum . lastly , I have not have to use the add piece because simply remove the house have prove sufficient for pick up anything the base can not . the one negative I can think of ... as with most vacuum the cord be a bit of a chore . all in all , it be cheap , it work . Great for light vacuuming and possibly more .
Vacuum	NEG	1	this vacuum have give we nothing but problem since we have have it . after the first month of use it the suction of the hose would not work properly if the whole sweeper be not take apart and clean in the sink after only a week worth of use . then it would start to stink like rot fish after use and wash under warm water , which the instruction say to do to clean the filter . would never buy this or recommend to anyone !
Vacuum	POS	5	this be one of the lowest-priced bagless upright hepa vacuum available on the market . in the 2 month since first use this vacuum , I have have be very pleased with its performance . it be very good at pick up stuff in my carpet . the only nitpick I have be that the dirt cup be small compare to other vacuum I have owned\/used , and empty it require expose the lower filter to some debris drop down into it . other than that , this Bissell be reasonably powerful , easy to use , easy to assemble , and reliable . the furniture brush work well . for the money , this vacuum be hard to beat . it be a excellent value and well worth you consideration .
Vacuum	POS	5	plenty of suction , nice long cord , for quick pick up . not the best for deep cleaning rug , but for the price , a good value .
Vacuum	POS	5	this be a must have vacuum ! my mom buy my two sister and I one over 25 year ago and we continue to use they and have give many away as gift . it be the best vacuum for hardwood floor , tile or linoleum . the suction be fantastic and since everything go straight into the bag you can pick up sand or even small piece of glass with it . it be great for clean out the car . I guarantee you will be surprise by the suction of this little Hoover Portapower !
Vacuum	POS	5	so after 8 year my hoover vacuum bit the dust . I actually do not do most of the vacuuming , my boyfriend do . so i research for the best vacuum with all of he requirement : 1 . must be bagless . `` I hate fumble with those stupid bag . '' 2 . must be upright . `` I do not want to be drag half the machine behind I '' 3 . must have cleaning tool . `` I have to get under the table and the baseboard too , it get gross ! '' this one meet all of he requirement ; bagless , upright , 4 tool . and it meet mine : must be reasonably price . we go to we local target and buy it , not ten minute after we be home my boyfriend have it out of the box and be go nut on we apartment . it be honestly hilarious , every minute he be scream out something like , `` this light be awesome babe !! '' `` oh my god , babe ! check out this turbo brush ! '' `` this thing have so much suction !! look at the crap I pull out of the carpet '' `` oh man , this vacuum rock !! '' we have only have it for a day but my entire apartment have be vacuum not once , but twice because he have to move all the furniture to vacuum underneath it . I love this vacuum because my boyfriend love it . you swear he be five-years-old and I buy he the newest , coolest , most awesomest toy ever . best purchase ever .
Vacuum	POS	5	seriously , not much to say that all the user -lrb- and vacuum repairman -rrb- have not already ... this be the best vacuum that I have ever use , hand down . I do a lot of research and consider all of the very expensive wind-tunnel , canister , and bag-less system , but `` Carpet pro '' keep pop up everywhere . the final straw be when I go to a vacuum store and repair shop and after about 20 minute of talk to the technician about the top of the line eureka and Dyson unit , I tell he that I be tire of buying , repair , and replace vacuum . I ask he what to buy if I simply want a well-working vacuum that will be the last vacuum I spend money on . he reply be two unit , the Carpet pro and another brand which cost in the region of $ 700 for the entry model . he state that both unit be `` truly professional '' -lrb- and not just a ordinary vacuum with the word `` professional '' write on it , in the case of the Carpet pro -rrb- and each be design for very aggressive daily use , such as to be use by a cleaning service or theater employee . they be not design for they feature or marketing trick , but for longevity and quality . if the repairman can compare this vacuum to a $ 700 unit , then I be all-in at just over two hundred dollar . important note : this vacuum be rate lower power than many other compete model , but the Carpet pro have far more suction , I can personally attest . this thing will suck you carpet off the ground , not a exaggeration . my very messy carpet in my art room look nearly \* brand new \* after I vacuum with this unit . if I have picture , you still would not believe it . this unit be very solid and the picture do not do justice . this unit be build extremely well in Germany , and consider that this unit have a real stainless steel beater bar -lrb- the rolling-pin-looking thing that hit the carpet , dislodge dirt -rrb- , stainless ball bearing for the bar , and the overall build quality make this unit a clear winner . no , there be no fancy vortex and you have to use a bag , but there be not a vortex vacuum on the market that could compete with this unit . I dare you to find another make of vacuum that include stainless bearing , let alone one with a stainless steel -lrb- or just \* METAL \* -rrb- beater-bar for anywhere in this price range . most vacuum use plastic beater-bar -lrb- or rarely wood , if you be lucky -rrb- and they have a press rod through the center of the bar , through which it spin . these will eventually melt and become loose ; rattle on the rod and in the compartment . not the Carpet pro , which have dedicate seal stainless steel bearing and the entire bar be metal , not just the metal rod that go through the plastic beater-bar , like that of the competitor . another thing to note , clear plastic be much more brittle than color plastic , and also much more prone to be damage or discolor by uv like that which come from the sun . most competitor use clear plastic that feel light , flimsy , and cheap , apparently to show you that the unit be work and to give the impression of it be more technical than it truly be . also realize that a lot of money be spend by the manufacturer to make they product look like it be technologically advance . money be not only spend on the design and r+d , but also in have to mold plastic in fancy , complicated , design and color to give that appearance . but this actually hurt the durability and longevity of they product and cost you more to buy the unit . the Carpet pro use a very rigid and thick color A.B.S. high impact plastic that do not flex or feel light . instead , it feel like I could whack this thing with a baseball bat and it would not break . it also feel like it be design for function and then wrap in this strong plastic . most of the other unit look like they be design and function come after . bottom line be that the Carpet pro , from a distance or picture , look like a very cheap , generic vacuum . however as soon as you get closer , touch it , or even use it , you will know the difference . anyway , the technician be ask $ 400 for the unit and if he would have lower he price to $ 300 dollar , I would have buy it through he . however , I be able to buy it on Amazon for 207 include s + h. if I have no other choice , I would have be happy pay the $ 400 after own this vacuum for about 6 month . search thoroughly ... read all review of this vacuum on Amazon and throughout the internet . if you want marketing and a fancy-looking vacuum , buy elsewhere . if you want something that will last the rest of you life , build better , and also perform better than almost any vacuum on the planet , this be you answer .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I have purchase this vacuum partially due to the rave review here . however , my expectation be not fully meet . while I would agree that this be a good vac for floor and small rug , I would not commend the suck power of the motor , and hold it on the showlder do not get comfortable with prolonged use and when you need to bend -lrb- it fall off -rrb- . in general for the price it be a good deal but it be useful to remember : you get what you pay for ...
Vacuum	POS	5	just purchase the Eureka Boss Smart Upright , base on a review in Consumer Reports -lrb- a `` cr best '' -rrb- . this vacuum have unbelievable suction !!! it pick up item my expensive Kirby miss and great on hardwood\/tile floor ! the attachment be easily accessible , too . you will not be dissappoint with you purchase .
Vacuum	POS	5	I be very happy with this product . great suction and easy to operate and empty .
Vacuum	POS	5	this vacuum cleaner perform exactly as I expect . I set the Roomba to run every day while I be at work and it sweep up everything and then return to it be charge base . the Roomba will never take the place of a standard vacuum cleaner that do a much deeper cleaning but now I only need to clean once a week . if you have pet like I do , you will need to empty the collection bin every day . but this be still faster than a regular vacuum cleaning every day .
Vacuum	POS	4	I get this vacuum for my fav . drive , since it go through a lot of abuse like camping and frequent visit to crystal beach with friend . have trouble clean all that sand every time , especially if you be finicky about you drive , so long story short , this vacuum as i call it cyclone , have a powerful motor , with rpm 's better then most of the handy vacuum on market . the pivot nose be a great help since it reach tough space ... the power cord be long enough to reach far end ... . and can be hook up to you cigarette lighter port ... powerful enough to suck penny so be careful ... . though a bit over prize toy ... but worth buying ... ...
Vacuum	POS	5	I be afraid that this vacuum would not have enough power to pick up the dirt in my car because of some of the review . I find that it work fine ! it be not a high power vacuum , but it pick up very well in between . the adjustable nozzle be a plus . it have be able to get to most -lrb- if not all -rrb- area of my car . it be very convenient .
Vacuum	POS	5	we get this Black & Decker compact vacuum cleaner more than a month ago and have be very happy with the quality , construction and performance of this little guy . First of all , it come package in a reusable box with a handle . the unit , the attachment and the little attachment holder that snap on to the unit so you can carry you attachment around the house with you all fit in the box for neat storage . as other reviewer say , this cordless vac must be recharge for about 20 hour after use . the charge last long enough to do those little cleanup chore around the house : vacuum up seed around the bird cage -lrb- use the round rubber attachment for floor -rrb- , clean the baseboard -lrb- there be a neat brush edger for that -rrb- , get into the crevice in the couch -lrb- a four foot hose help -rrb- and vacuum the stair . it be light and easy to carry -- I hate have to haul out the big vacuum for every little thing . the vac be bagless and easy to clean : just open the plastic door on the side and dump or brush out the accumulate dust and debris . I have have all sort of cordless vac and this be the best one yet .
Vacuum	POS	5	all the preview review be right about this product . it give enough power to get all the dirt that it be in you car . I must admit , for the price , the product be axcellent and easy to clean .
Vacuum	POS	4	my husband be skeptical when i tell he i order a vacuum online ! he 1st question be , `` if it be commercial do that mean it be go to be super heavy ? '' Ugh ... have not even think of that and do not remember see any review about it be weight !! I be happy to report that this vacuum be not heavy at all and probably lighter than my last . thing i love about it ... great suction , weight , and the way it lay flat to clean under furniture . thing i do not love about it ... this model do not come w \/ extension hose and the one that be on it be SHORT and i also do not care for the way the cord wind . that say , i think this be a great sweeper , especially for the price !!
Vacuum	NEG	1	because I work in a different state from where I actually live , I buy this 18-month ago in order to have a vacuum cleaner in the apartment I be rent . it seem to work ok but it be not long before I notice that the dirt never make it through the hose into the clear area where it be suppose to accumulate . I look up information about this and it be suggest that I could wash the filter , so I have try that but nothing happen . now , about every other time I vacuum I have to remove the hose and clean out all the dust and fiber that have accumulate . I have hear that bagless vacuum be bad , but this one seem to barely suck the dirt off the top of the carpet and I certainly do not feel like it ever provide a good cleaning . I be pretty sure when I move out of this apartment I should borrow a decent vacuum from a friend in order to give the carpet a good cleaning . I be also glad that I own a Hoover at my actual house and I certainly would not consider buy another Bissell after this experience .
Vacuum	POS	5	even if it be not price so low . it be work well on carpet , any height . the hose attachment be easy to use & seem pretty durable . it work fine on bare floor -lrb- ceramic tile , wood , concrete -rrb- . with the money save on this I also purchase the Bissell Pet Hard Floor Vacuum for $ 50 which do a fantastic job on the bare floor & be very lightweight . this vacuum be also not a heavyweight which I really like . so , wow for $ 130 I be set to clean & these machine do a good job .
Vacuum	NEU	3	I buy this to replace another Eureka Boss Vacume cleaner , that finally wear out . it be very similar but the vacume hose be much shorter on this new one . I be estimate it at 5 foot but I believe Eureka state it be longer . I replace the vacume hose on my old Eureka twice so I know this one will break\/tear also at the noozle . I have already order the extended 15 foot vacume hose to replace the short hose one on the new one . would recommend anyone buying this vacume cleaner to also buy the 15 foot extend hose at the same time . with that say , the vacume cleaner perform well , especially on carpet . it be noisy but most vacume cleaner be . I like this new one . have always have Eureka cleaner and be happy with they . give it three star because the hose be just too short on it . buy the 15 foot extension and you have a great cleaner .
Vacuum	POS	5	just get it and totally impressed with the power and they variety of attachment . it also have a nice long cord which be very handy .
Vacuum	NEG	1	I get this vacuum a few week ago and i hate it , it be awful it do not really suck up anything . I would not recommend this : -rrb-
Vacuum	NEG	2	I would not buy this product again because of poor design and quality . the vacuum be basic and function as it should but feel cheap and piece continually fall off . for the money I would look for a Kirby on the secondary market or buy any other brand .
Vacuum	POS	5	the robot go to work from the very first day . my husband have a guy night that weekend and all he could talk about be how impressed he be . I have not have to complain about pet hair since . he program it to do it be thing at 2 pm while we be both still at work . awesome !
Gloves	POS	5	I love it !!!! havent wear they yet wait for it to warm up some then I will put they to the test ...
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be great . they fit really well . my finger can move completely freely as if they be a second skin . and they be durable . I use they for everything and highly recommend they .
Gloves	POS	5	my wife ride a scooter to work in the early morning and hate the cold air get up she sleeve . this will no longer be a problem thanks to these glove . they be well make and she say very comfortable . the gauntlet will take care of the chilly sleeve problem .
Gloves	POS	5	can not go wrong with Mechanix wear glove . I use to buy the one with the wrist strap , but not anymore . the fast fit glove slide right onto you hand and no strap to deal with . certainly a preferred method imo .
Gloves	NEG	1	I swim in the ocean and rinse my gear with fresh water afterwards . I get 4-5 year of service from my wetsuit before they need to be replace , but this glove do not last 6 month . on the plus side , my hand stay warm .
Gloves	POS	5	I be not a great swimmer but I be not bad either . I be do my daily lap and wish I could have just a little something to put more challenge into my lap . these glove be just the thing . I actually could not do my usual 25 lap . I be lucky to get 15 the first day . they really do increase the upper body strength for every muscle group . they even give you hand a work out since you have to pull so much more water with each stroke . I would tell anyone that want great look tone arm and sholder to get a pair of these and go swimming .
Gloves	POS	4	these definitely do what you would expect and be fairly comfortable -lrb- although you may have some sore shoulder the next day ; - -rrb- . I be not sure if I should get the medium or the large and wish I have go with the smaller size .
Gloves	POS	4	so the glove be nice . Comfy , good padding , well-constructed . I be a decently heavy lifter -lrb- max : 120lb dumbbell in each hand -rrb- . nothing even remotely close to some people , but I can push some weight and the glove have def save my hand . only neg thing would be the area where the finger come together seem a little deep ... its hard to explain , but the webbing area inbetween you finger can get sore because the glove be ... deep-fingered ? anyway ... id def buy they again . harbinger be the s !
Gloves	NEU	3	I have be lift free weight for the past year and decide it be finally time to try use some glove to minimize the damage the weight be do to my hand . after read through the review , I buy the Harbinger pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Gloves . while the glove themselves do the job , they seem to be bulkier than they need to be which sometimes make I feel less comfortable lift heavier weight . overall not a bad product for the money , but if you be look for something slim then I would look elsewhere .
Gloves	POS	4	I buy mine one size smaller -lrb- medium -rrb- as recommend by other reviewer . thanks for the tip ! these glove help my lap time quite a lot . I do not have big polar bear paw or large foot so I need all the help I can get , swim . they do get waterlog , of course , but they stay on and be relatively comfortable . I also use they for stand up on the bottom work out for my upper body . I really like they .
Gloves	POS	5	the product arrive in time frame describe and in great condition . the glove be of great quality , especially for the low price . they be great for everyday boxing and practice , not so much for actual hardcore combat . Great buy !
Gloves	POS	5	I to be a little sceptical . Pretty pricey for a pair of glove sight unseen . not disappoint at all . work in 30-40 degree weather with galvanized metal and hand be not only well protected but do not get cold . -lrb- not for wet work though -rrb-  two thing that really point out how tactile they be : 1 . you can open the pop top of can -lrb- soda of course -rrb- with they on . never be able to do that with any work glove before .  2 . later on , the zipper present no problem either !  I be order pair for Dad and Brothers for X-mas .
Gloves	POS	4	this glove be great for we many month of winter here in the North . I be purchase my second pair just in case I lose the first pair .  I do not want to be with out a pair these glove !!
Gloves	POS	5	I get these for my dad for father day and he swim every morning during the week , these help to get he shoulder back up to par after he surgury and make swim a total workout , def . worth the purchase
Gloves	NEG	1	I use these glove for a day , ride a snowmobile . the leather tear in multiple spot , but my hand do stay dry . I do not use these glove to the extent as I would for work at home . all in all I be pretty disappoint . cheaper glove have last I a whole season .
Gloves	POS	4	I write this review when I first get they , but one pair do not last nine month in the chlorinate pool . so I guess I will get another or maybe two to alternate. : this product be perfect for my entire swim routine : walk in the pool -lrb- push I along -rrb- , do squat against the wall -lrb- it allow good secure grip onto rail and wall -rrb- , and crawl stroke -lrb- better workout -rrb- . I give it 4 star instead of 5 because I think I would like it even better if the webbing go right to the top of the finger and enclose they ... ok , so it be now a few month later since I edit this review and the two set of these swim fin I get in May 2008 have start to seriously deteriorate with normal use . they be rip alongside the seam where they be stitch . so I be send they back to Amazon and yes I be order replacement and this will be the last time . if they fail this time , I will send they back to Amazon and I will look for another brand . I will reduce the star to 2 .
Gloves	NEU	3	in about two month they be a mess . . smelly -lrb- not my hand , leather smell -rrb- fall apart etc. . I guess its time to get a new one but i d much rather buy a pair that last . no need to buy a new pair every two month .
Gloves	POS	4	these glove have change my mind . very good dexterity . I be no longer a full time tradesman , and I can not afford to have my hand in the shape they be in when I be in the field . I do more sale then work in the field , and I have develop `` office hand '' . these glove have save I more than once when I have to go back in the field . I recently re-shingle my house and wear the glove from start to finish . no callus , no tar under the nail , and best of all I have skin on my finger tip at the end of the job . the glove do take a beating , and I do not think they would make it thru another 15 square , but they fare much better than a pair of brown jersey would have . a litte tattered and a blow seam or two , but the finger tip stay on and no hole . they be a little pricey and if they be price at around $ 12 to $ 14 , I would feel that they would be more in line with what I like to spend , but my hand be glad I make the investment . somebody who use they everyday will be go thru too many pair in a year and at the price they be now you would be spend a good bit of you hard earn cash . but price they at $ 12 buck and supplier would not be able to keep 'em in stock .
Gloves	POS	4	the Everlast pro Style Training Gloves be a decent pair of glove to train on the heavy bag with . they be ok for spar but I would prefer something with a little more padding . the only slight issue that I have with the glove be that they be a tight fit with wrap on . I use the evergel 120 '' speed wrap and it be a little hard to get the glove on . I do not have big hand I have average size hand . so if you have big hand I would try look for a different pair . overall , it be a good pair of glove for hit the heavy bag . I would just suggest to get a thicker pair of glove if you want to spar .
Gloves	NEG	1	I should have read the other review more carefully before buy !  i be a homeowner\/handyman , and I use these glove for about 9 hour of light demo before the stitching in one of the finger start to fray .  before they start disintegrate , I have no problem with the glove . they be comfortable , the grip be good , and I enjoy the good tight fit . I find they give I the dexterity to do thing that I could not do with my regular cheapo work glove . I do find myself have to take they off every once in a while for task that demand a little extra dexterity , and in those case , the wriststrap\/tight closure be kind of a hassle . but if the glove have hold together , they would have be worth the price .  however , give the way these have hold up , it be unconscionable that these item be be market as anything other than disposable ! save you money !
Gloves	POS	4	I think I get my first pair of harbinger 143 glove from Amazon nearly three year ago now . that pair last quite a long time before I decide to replace they due to wear -lrb- seam come apart -rrb- and odor -lrb- after a while , it seem like no pair of leather glove be immune to stink , even after repeat wash -rrb- . I quite like my first pair and be surprise to find some less than good review here , include comment from people about how they glove fall apart rather quickly . well , I order another pair of these only about a year ago and they be already in much worse shape than the previous pair that last twice as long , despite get the same amount of use from I . I also notice that some other reviewer mention how these glove be tighter than they should be , and that do not describe my first pair but definitely describe my second . just a few day ago , I order another replacement pair . I obviously can not say whether they will hold up better than the second pair I have , but I can report that even though the glove be ostensibly the same size the new pair be , in fact , not nearly as tight on my have as my second pair . I be a bit frustrated by the lack of consistency in what be suppose to be the same product , but I do like these glove overall . -lrb- I guess that be obvious or I would not have order another pair again ! -rrb-
Gloves	POS	5	great product , sturdy and well fitting . good padding as well . great workout glove over all
Gloves	NEG	2	I follow the size chart provide on the web page and order small , but now I can barely put they on and barely take they out -lrb- the take out be so annoying -rrb- . they will be a good present for my friend that have small hand !
Gloves	POS	5	in my job I `` do the desk '' most of the week but in the PM and on weekend I work around the house pretty hard . in the past I wear out a couple of pair of leather glove each summer . I be currently build rock wall and these glove be hold up fine against rock whose sole purpose be to chew up glove and then hand . my hand be between med and large so I order the medium size and they fit good . some of the other review mention the price be kind of high but I figure I have save a couple of buck avoid have to buy two pair of leather glove . I like they .
Gloves	POS	5	I have short wide hand . these well fitting glove allow I to work in the yard with good control of tool . the elasticity make for a geat fit , and they breath well . here in humid Florida , that be important . I be very pleased with they .
Gloves	NEG	2	these be my first boxing glove and needless to say the last glove I ever buy for less than $ 50 . I know how to wrap my hand , and I know how to punch but I injure my knuckle twice in these glove . the first time I land a left hook to the temple of my spar partner . I be out for a month . I baby that hand for 3 month then the first day i go heavy on the bag with they I re-sprain the same knuckle again . first off a boxing glove will last you about 6 month if you be a 5 + session a week fighter . it 'll be more if you be a two a week fighter and pretty much a lifetime if you do that cardio boxing stuff . reason be the more you hit the bag or you partner the more the foam break down and sweating into the foam do not help either . about this glove : size : a little too small for my hand . I be a very big guy with very big hand so unless you hand hare as big as a NBA center like mine there be no need to worry about it . lining : First thing that wear out on mine . it fall apart inside and start to irritate my finger . not a light irritation either . it make my knuckle bleed the last day i wear they . Leather & Stitching : it be good . not a single stitch pop . foam : break down after a few month . also start get lumpy towards 4 month . Beathability : they breath about as well as a plastic bag . I supprise my finger do not prune up after my training session . it make the glove hard to dry out and then they smell horrible . they also make you hand smell horrible . ceadar chip help a little bit but after training session they make my hand smell like a dirty sock . hand protection : I think they leave it out of this model . I bruise my knuckle twice . not so with other glove . velcro : so easy to put on and take off . by far the easiest out of any glove I have own . bottom line : the look nice and do the job but do not risk hurt you hand to save money . if you be do cardio boxing at LA boxing and dont really hit the bag all that hard then they might work for you . you hand will still stink buy you wont get hurt . if you be serious about the sport and think you will do it for at least 6 month do you hand a favor and buy a pair of Title gel , Ringside IMF Tech , or Grants .
Gloves	NEG	1	i use these like 3-4 time and the finger already rip out of they . not durable to any reasonable extent . a common occurrence with glove . pro series , carhartt , you name it . my cheap dewalt last longer . go to try youngstown , ninja , and sealskinz .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove fit tight to the skin while increase you grip and provide some protection . the key here be to wear the right glove for the job . if I be handle something sharp , I 'll wear something heavier than these . perhaps the only flaw be in the labeling that these be heavy utility . I have be use these as a general work glove for a year now and love the fact that I still have some `` feel '' with these . I plan on pick up the framer style for situation that require more finger dexterity .
Gloves	POS	5	what can you say !!! when my wife like something it be gotta be the best . the gauntlet keep all the wind from blow thru she wrist . the fit be true . and the price !!!! these glove be half the price of competitor . thanks Jafrum for make they available and thanks Amazon for the amazing way you do business .
Gloves	POS	5	my favorite training glove , really like the design . they fit just great . I ve be train with they about 7 month . only thing , be that you must really wash em each month because the smell like leather .
Gloves	POS	4	these be good everyday gardening glove but not up to really heavy-duty use . I be mostly look for something that would fit comfortably for casual garden chore , and these do . but for those of we with big paw , it would be nice if a larger size be offer . I do not expect these to last more than a year with sporadic gardening project . so far , so good .
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these for my husband for use in he wood shop -lrb- 1 pair -rrb- and a second pair for use when he work on the car . we have a unheated garage and minimally heated wood shop . during the winter month -lrb- in Wisconsin -rrb- it allow he hand to be warm when work !
Gloves	POS	4	I buy these glove to work on a horse and cattle ranch for a few week . the ranch have 27 horse and about 100 cattle , all need feeding every day and other care . I wear these glove for two week , all day every day , about 12 hour a day of hard work . I would say they have about 150 hour of hard labor on they . by the end , there be tare in the seam along the glove line but the rest of the glove be still hold up strong . all in all , awesome glove . if use for basic mechanic , gardening , yard work , etc. . these baby will last a long time . on a horse\/cattle ranch ? maybe two week . I be happy with the use I get out of they for the money , I do not expect they to last more then a few day .
Gloves	NEU	3	product as picture , or so I think . glove be extremely comfortable . unfortunately the stitching be substandard and with less than 20 hour of use the thumb stitch be unraveling . this aside my biggest complaint be I assume that the same padding \/ insulation picture on top of the finger would also be on the thumb . there be no padding at all on the thumb make it extremely uncomfortable to do free weight curl , because you thumb be always chaff the inside of the dumbbell .
Gloves	POS	5	I use these at the fire department . the first day i get they we have a head on collision with glass everywhere . I be able to grip the `` jaws-of-life '' very comfortably and have good protection from debris . I would recommend these glove .
Gloves	POS	4	I have be use these glove for a month and have be hope they would stretch out some . they have stretch out some over time but not enough . I read the review before I purchase they and see all of the comment about how small the glove be so I order a xxl size even though I be typically and XL . upsize the glove 1 size be not enough for I because these glove and too be still too small . they be very well build and should be very durable , the size just stink . if you be consider buy these glove you should upsize they 1 - 2 size .
Gloves	POS	5	I can not say that I have try a lot of different weightlifting glove . all I can say be that these be great . they fit snuggly and comfortably , seem like they will be very durable . wear they do not just protect you hand , it add some measure of a feel of stability as well . definitely worth it compare to the cheap pair I buy before .
Gloves	POS	5	very happy with my choice of glove . so far ... because , only time and usage will tell about they longevity ! one thing though : I order size large , and get a size large , so tight that the glove be very difficult to take off , even worse after the workout ! and I do not have big hand at all . I buy another pair , from another brand , at the same time , same size large , and they fit I perfectly .
Gloves	POS	4	this be my second pair of these glove , so obviously I be satified with the quality . the glove be great for training and for help to perfect you stroke -lrb- they make it very obvious when you be not do thing correctly -rrb- . the only reason they do not get five star be because , as other reviewer have mention , the wrist be a little loose . the velcro do not quite go over far enough to tighten they up to where I would need for they to be snug . it be a little distracting when swimming , but definitely workable .
Gloves	POS	5	day in and day out , these be the swim add on that I can not live without as I now feel as if my hand be build as they should be for swimming . after all , this be what creature from other species who be build to swim be give as part of they dna code . webbed paw , what more could I wish for in the water ? these be perfect for every swimming stroke : side stroke , crawl , breast stroke , all back stroke , underwater swimming . I do not even bother take they off for surface diving . my hand and arm be so much stronger after swim with these daily . it be the easiest thing to add into any water workout and feel part of you body from day one .
Gloves	POS	4	I get they for my boyfriend who start lift , he say they be great . they help with hand pain so he can lift heavier weight and for longer duration . for beginner , I would strongly recommend !
Gloves	POS	4	add to the workout in water aerobic . run large but well worth the cost . help with back exercise and resistence
Gloves	POS	4	I have own these glove for about a month . I have swim with they about 100 lap per week . they be comfortable and extremely functional . guess the size be really the only dilemma in purchase they . it be good to err on the side of larger than you think .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be great ! they be size small so order they large like every one else say . they be a little stiff at the web of you finger when they be new but a couple workout and they fit and feel fine . I have no problem with loss of grip do lat pull downs or pull up with these glove at all . the leather in the palm have just the right amount of thickness and be very tough but pliable . the mesh back be breathable and do not overheat you hand . I would have pay twice the price for these if I have to .
Gloves	POS	4	I love these thing ! they can turn a aerobic exercise session in the pool into a excellent resistance session . this be my second pair and I purchase they as a backup to my original because it be difficult for I to shop from my location . this pair have velcro closure -lrb- old pair do not -rrb- and the sizing be accurate . my only complaint be the stitch between the finger which make the glove into a `` web '' . the stitch go up too far and the point of the Vee that it form dig into the webbing between some of my finger -lrb- see product pix -rrb- . I be hope that this soften up with wear , but I still love these thing !
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these glove to hit the heavy bag and practice my Krav Maga when I be not use my Harbinger MMA style glove . I can not speak to the durability of these glove because I have have they a week and only use they once but they seem decent . they do the job with protection and the mesh ventiliation allow for some cooling -lrb- if that be possible with wrap -rrb- . I would recommend these glove . I like the velcro because I can use my tooth to get the second glove on . as other have mention , the only downside be the smell . holy smoke they smell like they be forge by mutant in a radioactive toxic waste dump and have the ability to easily stink up a small non-ventilated space , even when not in use . I be hope that fade over time and my better smell BO take over . put these glove on , wear you three wolf shirt to the gym , and do not be surprise when the lady start throw they phone number at you .
Gloves	POS	5	love they . Super well make , great padding -lrb- not to much or to little -rrb- and they have little tab which make take they on and off easier .
Gloves	POS	4	the glove be a little small , so I get a larger pair . the larger pair be the right size , but the finger be a little long . this make it a little discomfort when you squeeze a bar . but its minor . not a big deal , but that why I give they a 4 instead of a 5 . other than that they be nice and good quality . would recommend .
Gloves	NEG	2	I work in a freezer full of frozen food where the temp be consistantly 10 degree fahrenheit . after 20 minute with these glove on plus a polypropelyne glove liner my finger have already start get numb . the padding around the finger to keep they insulate be nonexistant . I like the dexterity and the grip from these glove . that be about it . for 49.99 though , I think the average person would be better off buy a extra large ski glove from walmart and layering that up with glove liner to keep warm during work .
Gloves	POS	5	great deal ! there not the best glove but they be very good glove . I be a very happy Buyer ! I hope other customer find this out too . : -rrb-
Gloves	NEU	3	I buy these glove because I start work out at the gym and need add protection to my hand , since I have carpal tunnel . these glove protect my palm from the pressure and I have less pain in my hand . I wish the fit be tighter around the finger , but ince I wear ring , the fit work out so I do not have to take my ring off ; and I be now wonder if I should get a glove to fit up around my wrist for add support . my hand be med-large and I have long skinny finger , so the fit be not custom make , but for now they be work out for my workout routine .
Gloves	POS	4	glove be great . they protect you skin from the weight but be light and breathable so you do not sweat a lot . solid purchase !
Gloves	POS	5	I recently return to swim regularly and have not try swim glove . the Speedo glove be great for strength training , they fit well , go on and come off easily .
Gloves	POS	4	these be great workout glove for the price . great ventilation and protection during a hard workout . the only problem I have with the glove be that it run a bit small .
Gloves	NEG	2	I read the review here and after compare to other product i decide to pull the trigger , my hand measurement be a bit under 8 in . so i assume a medium -lrb- 7-8 -rrb- would be a good fit , it be not , way too tight , the inseam between the finger be digging in the soft skin webbing between you finger , the material be way too short for my hand as it do not cover the whole palm and overall very uncomfortable , it be the natural color , which i return , though it seem like it would show dirt very easily second try i go for the large black , it should fit I very well this time , not the case , same problem with the medium still , the material be not enough to cover the palm to give you a comfortable fit , when you spread you hand open wide there be a gap of air between the glove and you palm that be always uncomfortable , and same problem with the inseam digging between my finger , the material be too tough , i decide to follow the advice of the person upload he photo to cut small slit between the finger , it have to cut slit in every inseam to feel comfortable , the pain be almost go but the finger be much shorter now . I also notice on my first workout use it that the stitching be miss in one area of the glove , but i ' v already alter the product so I can not return it now . the wrapping be very uncomfortable as well . so to sum it up ; con : 1 . way too small , not enough material to cover the entire hand , uncomfortable 2 . fabric be painfully digging int he seam between the finger 3 . you might find miss stitch 4 . the clasp be uncomfortable 5 . bad design and workmanship pro : good quality leather overall I would definitely not recommend it , I only give one star over the minimum for the leather quality but i would recommend look else where , and maybe look for a different brand as I read similar complaint to mine on other harbinger product review what would I buy if i have to do it all over ? I do a lot of research on different glove and the Schiek 530 glove seem to be a solid one . a bit pricey but a good glove can last for year
Gloves	POS	5	my hand be extremely calloused and rough before buy these glove . so much so that they even have harden area that would hurt people when I shake hand . if you be go to be lift extremely heavy weight these be the glove to buy . they have a great fit . they be snug but do not cut off circulation . I would highly recommend these glove to anyone that do weight training .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be fantastic . the excellent fit couple with the over all durablity make these gloce perfect for heavy yard work . I have be use a sigle pair for almost a year now and it be not untill i have to split and stack 8 rick of wood in a weekend untill they start to show some wear . I would seriously recommend these glove for anyone do any heavy yard work or simmilar work .
Gloves	POS	5	the fast fit glove perform very well . I just complete two hour of very detailed work with many small part , some part needle size . I be able to complete all work without remove the glove . excellent .
Gloves	POS	5	so I take the time to write a review for this wonderfull product . what can you expect from speedo ? nothing but the BEST . as soon as I use these , I feel the strain in my muscle . they really add more strength and resistance , to you upper body . you can expect a very goood intense workout !
Gloves	POS	5	very good grip around the wrist which be really important when you be train with heavy weight . Enough cushion for the palm of you hand . and the price be good too . I do recommend these .
Gloves	POS	4	basically a very good pair of glove . they work very good and be easy to strap . they do not start smell and they stay fresh . they be easy to put on and they have a little thing to keep the glove from slip but not to much to annoy you .
Gloves	NEU	3	I buy a pair of the 14 oz a couple year ago and they last for like two and a half year . then the lining start rip and they be hopelessly stinky so I buy a new pair last week . the new pair stink like chemical \* way \* worse than the other pair , the wrist be much floppier and offer no support , and the velcro be harder to fasten .
Gloves	POS	4	the Gloves look good . I be hope these glove have a little more padding , but overall I have see much less padding in most other . overall i would recommend as they also look very nice .
Gloves	POS	5	I use these glove 5 time a week . go on the 12th week now , still go strong . these glove be on point !
Gloves	POS	5	I purchase 2 pair of glove for a friend of mine and for myself . I be look for this purchase since a long time ago and take advantage of the recent low price on this item . ship be free and I be very pleased with the quality and the ease of use of the glove . they sure be thin yet strong enough to protect you hand while work . I use they to fix my car mostly . I would recommend this purchase .
Gloves	POS	5	great product for increase intensity for upper body in aquatic exercise . far superior to lycra glove I have use in the past . would recommend for anyone look for result . sign , a water fitness instructor
Gloves	POS	5	I buy these for my sister 's 20th birthday gift . she love they ! they fit great , work perfect , and be very stylish ! I could not have get anything better for she !
Gloves	NEU	3	the Haringer pro FlexClosure glove be ok at best . the size guide be not very accurate . get the glove on and off be not very easy . also , the glove cut into the finger 's webbing so it be not very comfortable . get the glove at you local Walmart would be cheap and of good quality .
Gloves	NEU	3	I read the customer review before purchase this product . everyone recommenede order one size up . instead , I order accord to the size chart on harbinger 's website . accord to the measurement , I require a medium ... which be what I order . upon receive they I find they to be surprisingly too big . they be loose , and unlike other customer , I find the finger hole to be quite big . I double check the pacakaging and tag inside the glove . they both claim m. I hate the hassle of return item , so for $ 10 ... I will probably just give they away . still a waste . they seem to be of good quality , other than be slightly scratchy on the inside due to seam .
Gloves	POS	4	I have go through 3 pair of these over the last 3 + year . that be more longevity than other I have use . these be comfortable and give I the right amount of protection . I be go to put these on my Christmas list . I be about due for a new pair . smell be a problem , but it have be with all glove I have have . just get to rinse they out more often .
Gloves	POS	5	these glove be just what my husband be look for . he think they be great for he workout and very comfortable .
Gloves	POS	5	I have get to highlight these as quality glove . the leather here be soft , flexible , and properly place . the material do not shrink in the wash .
Gloves	POS	4	I be look for a pair of glove that be lightweight , and would not bunch up my finger too much . these definitely fit the bill . they be not the warmest glove , but I be expect to have a tradeoff between warmth and dexterity , and be glad to have they .
Gloves	POS	5	I have wear a pair of these glove for three winter now intermittently for construction work and they be just start to go . I have go through many pair of cheaper brand in the interim , and find that these be worth the extra money . I have also use other brand that have Kevlar stitch which work well but cost more do not hold up any better . these be the perfect combination of dexterity and warmth . they be not `` hold you hand under a faucet '' waterproof but they keep out rain and snow . I often wear another pair of insulate leather glove over these if it be really cold and remove they to grab nut and screw , etc. . I have try the rest and I be come back for my second pair of ccg .
Gloves	POS	5	yes there may be gym glove that you can get for a couple dollar less , but the quality suffer by a lot . this pair of glove be not only stylish but they serve they purpose to the best .
Gloves	POS	4	the glove be really nice and seem to have a lot better quality than the older style . my only problem be that the old style fit with XL but these be a bit more tighter . after a while my finger start to get the numb sensation . I have be wear they for 2 week now and they area around the finger have loosen up . if you do not mind the tightness at first I would get these glove . they feel good and provide pretty good flexibility . or you can get the next size up : -rrb-
Gloves	NEU	3	I work for up load truck . this glove be nice and comfortable . however they be not good for load box . the glove start to wear off by the tenth day .
Gloves	POS	4	I love these glove from Ironclad . durable and warm they be perfect for work outside in the snow and cold . my hand have stay dry and warm even when have to work in wet , icy condition reach into sump and drain . I be back to update my review on these glove . the paragraph above be write on February 15 , 2009 and today be January 24 , 2011 . I be still use these glove and find they to be very warm except when it get to bitter cold temp . once the outside air temp drop into the teens or single digit , with wind chill temp in the negative I can feel my finger start to get cold and numb if I be not actively use my hand work on something . other than that these glove still work great at keep my finger warm and toasty . I would also like to say that they be water proof to a point . I be reach into iced over gutter with water under the ice remove leaf and while my actual skin be stay dry I could tell the glove be get water log . I could take they off and ring they out so I be guess the water proof layer be the inner most layer of the glove . I also use these glove when walk my dog , remove snow off the driveway and when work outside in the cold such as on my snow blower . the textured finger tip allow I to pick up even tiny washer lay on the cement ! I be notice a lot of `` irish pendant '' or little string hang off the glove around the stitching , but that start a few month after I begin use the glove and it have not be a issue in durability yet .
Gloves	POS	4	with all thing this review be pretty much a pro and con list of thing that I have experience personally with my glove . after 2 week of 2 a day training in they I have a pretty good feel for they ability and short coming . pro : the glove itself have good hand\/finger coverage in general . the padding in the palm be thin enough for pull exercise but there be enough there to help support heavier weight when you be do a push exercise -lrb- i.e. bench press -rrb- . con : I have be a large in every other glove I have wear , I order the XL just in case they run small and find that even the XL size glove be smaller than the typical glove -lrb- they do stretch out after a day or so -rrb- . overall : I would recommend these glove . heavy lifter might want to seek out a harbinger brand with more padding . I have yet to wash they due to the fray around the wrist area and would like to get my $ value before test they washing\/drying durability .
Gloves	POS	4	these glove be comfiortable and quick dry , great for daily workout . note the thumb be attach to teh finger so pick up a water bottle to drink from during a workout be difficult .
Gloves	POS	5	I buy my second pair of glove after the 1st be steal at my local gym , and be really please with they , the only tiny niggle be the finger be a bit tight and I have to kinda pull the cut off part of the finger ending to get they off but im sure with time that will become easier as the glove mold to my hand .
Gloves	POS	4	I buy my 14 year old son 16 oz . and train with a 70 lb training bag great quality glove .
Gloves	POS	4	good product . do what it be suppose to do . only problem be that i purchase a `` medium '' since I wear a 7 glove . the glove run large and I should have choose a small . it would have be good to have size info
Gloves	NEU	3	I purchase two set of glove . I have use one set for less than 2 month and the rubber on the palm side of the glove have already develop large split . I use they for less than 25 minute per session . I find the glove useful in create resistance but would not recommend they for value receive .
Gloves	NEU	3	these glove be very comfortable and excellent for fitness in a standing position in the pool . . but overall they be extremely bad . I use they maybe 2 month and the palm on the right hand glove start crack until it finally break down completely . I order normal hard swimming pad but those be only great for swim stroke only . . im force to buy these for the fitness sadly ... I wouldnt buy THEM if you be going to DO SWIMMING LAPS with THEM Yes for the fitness and resistance part .
Gloves	POS	5	these be my first pair of workout glove , so I do not have anything else to compare they with , except for biking glove . I have be use these glove for a month and they be still work well and be comfortable , flexible , breathable and durable -lrb- and a bit thicker than biking glove -rrb- . however , some of the threading be fraying -lrb- normal wear-and-tear -rrb- . I do not have any problem with fitting ; I use the size chart on the product page to select my size . the glove webbing around the digit occasionally get tight while work out .
Gloves	NEU	3	purchase because many review have say these be better than those mechanix glove they have at home depot . I can see why many would feel that way , but I struggle to enjoy these glove at work . for one , the leather on the palm\/fingers be way too soft . I can not grip cardboard box very well with these on , and you can forget about anything make of plastic . I plan on use these to protect my finger from splinter off the terrible wooden table at work , but instead of pull shard out of my skin I have to tweeze they out of these soft glove . tl ; dr : a harder leather would have make these perfect for I .
Gloves	POS	5	these be awesome ... exactly what I be look for , I use they in my swim arobic class & work beautifully ! I can feel it work my arm so much more than without . very good price too !
Gloves	POS	5	I wear they ride my bike to work and back . I work out door and handle alot of money , they be perfect for count money , keep my hand warm and ride my bike . they be well make and strong .
Gloves	POS	5	I have have my pair for about 2 year and they be still hold up well . they dont cover up the entire finger but that be what I want . I still want to maintain some decent hand control with the equiment and these glove do the job nicely . I would recommend these to anyuone who lift weight fairly regulary or work the rig on a larger sail boat and want to protect thier hand .
Gloves	NEG	1	the inside of the right glove begin to shred within a matter of week . unfortunately it be past the return policy of the seller . needless to say I be very displeased . ------------------------------------------------------------------------- also do not order from MMA one stop shop they be not a licensed dealer so if the product be defective the manufacturer will not do anything about it . they customer service be useless .
Gloves	NEG	2	this show glove with a velcro wrist . what I recieve be two pair with zipper . the zipper be very low quality and more suit for doll clothes than athletic equipment . the zipper pull break after a few month of use and I have to sew the sipper shut . I would not recommend these cheaply make glove .
Gloves	POS	5	nice glove , good dexterity . not for very heavy work -lrb- and not make for mechanic -rrb- , but really nice for anything else . recieve on Time , would recommend seller .
Gloves	POS	4	I be skeptical of these glove when they arrive . they seem so thin . but after about one month of everyday use , I be very pleased .  I be tire of get sore hand from my generic leather glove . they seem to have lump and bump that irritate my hand . so I decide to try the Ironclad .  I have use they for all of these task : move lumber , handle and splitting firewood , handle barbwire -lrb- do not get poke in the palm , just lucky ? -rrb- , digging and just general use to protect my hand . I even wear they while use my digital camera .  the dexterity be excellent . I have be able to pick up and hold nail and screw with the glove on .  i wear the glove more because of the great dexterity . the regular leather glove have to come off to do most small task , while the Ironclad can be worn most of the time .  the glove do not so any sign of wear , so far . the only thing they do not offer be wrist protection . they be short and not good for wet work . that be why I give they four star , instead of five . but they be easy to carry in you pocket .  two day ago I be handle firewood -lrb- without the glove -rrb- and get a big splinter in my thumb . I 'll never do that again ...
Gloves	POS	5	buy for a `` guy '' gift at Christmas party . the person who get it use they and really like the fit and quality of the glove . definitely recommend as a work glove outside .
Gloves	POS	4	these be decent quality for a good price . notice they rip at the bottom a few time while pull they on .
Gloves	POS	5	these be great glove for light to medium work . I live on a large wooded lot and mother nature , especially lately , have make sure that I have to clear a lot of brush and do a lot of chain sawing , and they be perfect for pick up branch , log , etc. . they be also perfect for change the chain because they protect you hand and allow for great dexterity . I be not sure what people be do with they that wear they out , but mine show no sign of wear through . I just buy two more pair - one to keep in my car and another for non-greasy work . I have get a lot of chain see oil on the original pair and so reserve they for dirty work . another plus be that they fit tightly enough that I can wear they inside my mitten when I snow blow . they keep my hand warmer and when I have to take the mitten off to do something , I be not bare handed .
Gloves	POS	5	IRONCLAD ? what else do you need to SAY ... the ONLY GLOVES MY MEN will wear .
Gloves	POS	5	I read review and purchase this - Harbinger pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glove -lrb- Black , large -rrb- Undoubtedly this be 75 % leather and fit perfect ... another FYI ... my hand measure 7.5 , but I buy the large -lrb- coz it be kinda cheaper -rrb- and it fit perfectly ... thanks a lot ...
Gloves	POS	5	bought 5 pair for the guy in the family for Christmas and be give as gift . all be more than pleased . I have have a pair since last year and think they might enjoy they as I have . these be perfect for drive or light work outside plus they be stylish and comfortable . ship be quick and easy even right before the holiday .
Baby	POS	5	these be awesome for on the go . you do not have to put a messy dirty bib back in you bag , just toss and go !
Baby	POS	5	this product be outstanding ! we use it to take we 2 year old and he car seat across the country and it work like a charm . it even allow we to take we son off a airplane and through a airport sound asleep ! he enjoy he `` stroller '' and would ask to ride in it as soon as it be hook up . it be a breeze to hook together and be a easy matter to take apart and reattach for security check . it be important to note that it only work with a latch system car seat . Ours be a older Britax Roundabout and it work perfectly . we be ask several time by airport personnel , other mother and random people where we get the product . over six year and several trip with we child , we have try a car seat bag -lrb- the strap break -rrb- and a back-pack strap thing -lrb- then we still have to carry we child or a stroller -rrb- and both be outrageously expensive and very disappointing . this inexpensive product be a true find and I intend to tell every parent I know travel with a car seat all about it !
Baby	NEG	2	I buy this after my second child be bear to protect we car 's seat from the child seat . I have the original thin Prince Lionheart from my first child and love it . this one be so bulky with the build in lip that it get in the way of anyone have to sit next to it in the car . also , the two part design cause so many problem as it constantly come undo cause the top portion to slip down -lrb- thus defeat the purpose of protect the seat -rrb- . it do catch spill , but the original thin seat saver do too and actually do a better job . I have just recently move the original one under my younger child and discard this one altogether . I will look for something else to put under my older child 's seat . I do not recommend this product .
Baby	POS	5	I love this product ! it be cute , easy to assemble , and easy to attach to the crib . however , the only problem I have come across be change the battery . you have to take it off of the crib , then take off the back panel , and then change the battery . my daughter 's crib be against the wall , so I have to pull she crib out every time I need to change the battery . the remote control work great , and the different melody -lrb- or rainforest sound -rrb- be really great . all around , I would say I would purchase this again !
Baby	POS	5	very nice product . bought multiple pair . velcro adjustment allow you to tailor the fit . reversible so you can see diff pattern . keep from scratch . prompt shipping . would recommend this product .
Baby	NEG	1	I buy this for we Joovy Ergo Caboose and it do not fit -- perhaps there be fine print in the literature state as much , but wish I have know before I go to the trouble of order it . look like a nice organizer -- too bad it be go back to Amazon , and I be go back to the draw board .
Baby	POS	5	it be a great bib . it have excellent coverage for my 2-year-old . now I can let he feed himself soup , ice cream , yogurt , etc. without worry about he get it all over he clothes !
Baby	POS	5	the picture doesnt do justice to this product . and the color be off as well in the picture . its sooo soft and feel great . I order this product along with the Papagayo bedding and it blend greatly with it . the Poker dot on the cover pad be exactly the same as the bedding . and the monkey be just adorable ! absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to everyone .
Baby	NEG	1	this pump be pretty terrible . some people like it , and for some people it work for a week or a month before give up the ghost . maybe Evenflo have poor quality control standard , but mine do not even work once . I get barely anything , and it pinch painfully to boot . I use a medelum until the motor finally give out -lrb- it be a hand I down -rrb- , so it be not like I have never pump before . complete waste of money , as it sound like you be just roll the dice on if you get a good one or not .
Baby	NEG	2	the cloth use for this product be too stiff to be kid-friendly . even though it be absorbent , but it scratch baby 's neck area . would not recommend this for other parent .
Baby	POS	5	we be a Halo Sleepsack family , both my kid -lrb- 28mo & 6mo -rrb- wear they . this one be particularly cute .
Baby	POS	5	my 3 month old daughter love both she sophie and she Pie toy . both be a soft rubber that smell good - somewhat vanilla - and both be squeaky , which delight she . the Pie toy be a early favorite and Sophie have more recently become a favorite as she learn how to stick the foot in she mouth . the one concern in we house be that the dog think these be he toy because they be squeeky , so we do have to be vigilant about keep they off the floor . we recently receive a second Sophie as a gift and now keep one at home and one in the diaper bag so she be never without it .
Baby	POS	5	this toy be so cute ! my grandaughter be maybe too young to really appreciate it yet -lrb- 4 month -rrb- but I hope she 'll love it eventually . there be several other , and they be all really adorable .
Baby	POS	4	this come prewrapped in cellophane - so it be hard to actually judge the product . it be a gift at a baby shower and as far as I can tell the recipient like it and say the sock be great . I do like the packaging - cute idea .
Baby	POS	5	Great for baby like mine who kick they cover off all night . it be nice and light in the summer and give extra warmth in the winter with pj underneath . love it !
Baby	POS	4	this be the first time I try the Thirsties Diaper Cover and the gusset really help to keep the leak in . you do need to change the diaper often becuase they will not keep leak in for long but that be par for the course if you be go the cloth diaper route . overall , the deign of the cover make it very easy for a quick change .
Baby	POS	5	before I leave the house I throw this necklace around my neck . my daughter be 6 month old and know this be hers to chew away . you cant even tell its a teethe ring and I feel safe know she wont drop it on the floor .
Baby	NEG	2	I be disappoint that this do not fit my active bjorn better . it also have a rough feel to it . it honestly work better just to put he in a bib and then tuck it into the front .
Baby	POS	5	I love this swim diaper . very easy to use ! just put it on and wash it off if baby poop ! what could be easier ? sure beat pay out the wazoo for swim disposable diaper . so good for the environment !
Baby	POS	5	we be one of those hippie family that do `` baby-led weaning '' . for those who do not know what that mean , we skip the puree and rice cereal and go straight to allow we son to try feed himself bit of `` real '' food at 6 month old . although we never use traditional baby food , we do give my son natural applesauce and full-fat unsweetened yogurt . instead of spoon it into he mouth , we `` load '' the spoon for he and hand it to he so he could learn to feed himself . these spoon be great for even a young baby to use for self-feeding . they be lightweight enough that we son could handle they even at 7 month old . they have a long handle , which be good for a baby that do not have pincer grasp yet and still grip anything in he fist . and the bowl be small and relatively deep compare to other baby spoon , so the food do not spill out too easily despite be maneuver by my little one who still flail a bit . the spoon be bright and my son love they . they be easy to clean and to carry in a diaper bag . I can not recommend they enough .
Baby	POS	5	I buy bumpkin , FuzziBunz and Thirsties when I be build my stash for my first child and the Thirsties fit my daughter the best from day one -lrb- well technically day 3 -rrb- . my daughter be 7 lb 6 oz , tall and skinny . the Thirsties cover fit she the best . the extra smalls -lrb- newborn -rrb- be great for she tiny butt and she wear they until she be about 4 month old . my daughter be now 5 month and the smalls be just now fitting she well . I like that the tab have the velcro material on they so you can overlap they for really skinny baby . the leg gusset be a little loose when my daughter be 3 month and under , but ever since she gain a bit of weight -lrb- maybe by 09 lb -rrb- they fit she perfectly . and the leg gusset do not leave mark on she leg like the bumpkin do -lrb- too tight maybe ? -rrb- . the few time my daughter have blow out of she cloth diaper , the Thirsties contain the mess well , unlike the bumpkin which get the poo everywhere . I be definitely keep these thirsty for the next child .
Baby	POS	5	I love these shell . we use they with gdiaper insert and work great . they be nice and trim . my little girl look very comfortable in they .
Baby	POS	5	I have buy 4 of these to date . two for my family to use and the other two as gift for family member . it be very durable and do a great job protect leather and cloth seat .
Baby	NEG	2	this item be over price . how can you expect anyone to pay that much for a child item which they grow out of so quickly . I think it should be in the $ 20 price range .
Baby	NEG	2	I get a lot of compliment on these because they be cute , but my 6 month old be crawl in they for no more than 5 minute and they be wear thin and the thread be unraveling . I be very disappointed . if you be look for leg warmer that will hold up with a active baby then choose a different brand .
Baby	POS	5	pro : while the price of these be a bit difficult to swallow , the bib be fantastic and very much worth it . all my daughter 's previous bib be far too big , and do not have the rolled collar like the Tommee Tippees do , and so the formulum that she spit back out would run down she neck and make she hair\/clothes sticky . with these bib , we no longer have that problem , as this ingenious design of the rolled collar catch \* everything \* . con : a bit costly , and the velcro backing be not as durable as one would expect when pay $ 7.50 per bib . overall : the best bib we have encounter so far , and we would definitely recommend they !
Baby	NEG	1	I can not get these bowl to stay suction onto we highchair tray for longer than 1 minute . I have try make sure the tray be perfectly clean & smooth , wet the bottom suction cup , etc. , but nothing will keep it on . my son do not even try to lift the bowl and it pop up and move around while he be try to eat . once even pop up before anyone have touch it at all ! if you want bowl that actually stay suction on , I would suggest the similar `` sassy '' bowl set that also have lid . they design have a removable suction cup that fit all three bowl . I think it work better because the suction cup be all one piece of flexible rubber and be not join to the hard plastic bowl like the Munchkin set be .
Baby	POS	5	I receive one of these as a baby gift and love it so much I come on Amazon to buy another one ! I have one attach to the diaper bag and one attach to the stroller -lrb- for walk and short outing that do not require the diaper bag -rrb- . this way I have the pacus ready where ever we be .
Baby	POS	5	I order these mitten because I want something to keep my six month old son 's hand warm for winter . these mitten do exactly what the description say . the large size fit my baby well with room to grow and the velcro strap be genius . there be no way the mitten be come off . I have wash they several time and the color hold up well . I have not notice any shrinking , even though I put they in the dryer . the price be worth it . I have already recommend they to other new mom . two thumb up !
Baby	NEG	1	I think these look like decent burp clothes from the picture . get they and they be super thin and after I wash they , they shrink-ed and get even thinner . I would not waste you money on they . I spend $ 11 on a 3 pack of Carter 's brand and they be WAY better and worth the money .
Baby	POS	5	these be absolutely the best bib ! we have three child and be still use the same bib from the first child who be now 7 . so easy to clean . excite to find they here because I think they do not make they anymore and guard the one we have like gold ! order more for we family and send some as gift .
Baby	POS	5	this be a great sleepsack for warmer weather . I purchase this for the end of summer\/beginning of fall and it be just the right thickness for the season .
Baby	POS	5	this be very nice item , for sure would buy again ! baby like to stay in this pad while i be change he .
Baby	POS	5	I love the Avent product line . since I last use they , they have definitely improve . with the new ring that hold the nipple in place , I do not have any issue with the bottle leak . this be a very nice surprise and a change that I do not mind complete a extra step for . as usual , they hold up great and limit the fussiness . the pacifier cover be lifesaver since I hate put they into the diaper bag without protection . with the cover , I no longer have to put the pacifier into a ziplock bag to keep they clean .
Baby	POS	5	I be give two of these cover and start use they when I bring my son home from the hospital . although they be a little big , and occasionally leak , I find they provide the best protection of anything I try . he be now six month old and can poop out of ANY diaper , except a cloth cover with a Thirsties cover . I like the new design where both tab have velcro on the outside , so no matter which side I attach first , the other side can layer over the first tab .
Baby	POS	5	I purchase these to wipe off my daughter pacus when it get dirty and they be perfect for that , but they be also perfect for wipe dirty face , and mouth after eat . these wipe be a great size and I love the many use for they . I feel better use these on the kid face over the one with chemical in they . I highly recommend these wipe for kid of all age !
Baby	POS	5	this be my favorite bottle brush because it stand up and it have a sponge at the end , not bristle . I think this be one of the only brand with that combination . brush with only bristle at the tip make a big splashy mess . I can not seem to use they without liberally spray everything within 6 foot when I wash the bottle . yeah , these brush do not last forever . neither do my kitchen sponge . I have be replace these every 3 or 4 month . I think that be a decent lifespan for something that be use multiple time a day , every day . go Dr. Brown .
Baby	NEG	1	I be give a double snap-n-go stroller as a baby gift from a relative . after two use , the stroller break and will no longer fold down . not only be I strand in a parking lot when the stroller break , but I have be unable to use the stroller -- and thus , unable to leave the house with my newborn twin - for ten week while I have go back and forth with Baby Trend 's customer service department . the Baby Trend customer service department have have I disassemble the stroller three time ... take and email two picture of the broken stroller ... I have have 3 + phone conversation with 4 different customer service rep ... I have wait a total of ten business day for two different box that be send to I -- neither of which be large enough for the stroller . all the while , I be a mother of four child under 4 year of age . they have be completely unreasonable in what they have ask I to do ... the latest request be to wrap the stroller in a black garbage bag to send it back to they ... something that FedEx highly discourage -lrb- and say there will likely be damage to the stroller -rrb- . I have literally miss out on many family experience due to this broken stroller and Baby Trend 's refusal to remedy this issue . we can not take out twin out of the house without a double stroller - and unfortunately , we make the mistake of get a Baby Trend product . do not make the mistake of buy this product . the only thing worse than the quality of the product be the level of customer service you will get from Baby Trend .
Baby	NEG	2	purchase THIS for a 5 month old who be DRULLING A LOT . he like put it in he mouth BUT WOULD not chew on it .
Baby	POS	5	good size - compact , but hold a lot . also very easy to take apart \/ reassemble between kid , and compact when store . we be use it again for we second and it hold ton of bottle . the grate be small enough to set small pump-part on to dry without they fall through .
Baby	NEU	3	although these spoon look colorful and cute it be hard to use they to feed young baby . they be too curved and it be hard for young baby to completely remove food from the bottom of the spoon . I imagine that these could be use for liquid food but they be not as good for puree for witch I recommend use flatter spoon .
Baby	POS	4	this be a great mobile , my only critique be that the song end too quickly . my son love it . almost 3 month old and he stare at it and fall asleep to the music .
Baby	POS	5	this be the perfect solution for all those bath toy for we . there be a compartment for shampoo , soap , loofah , etc , a compartment for small toy and a compartment for larger toy . I have not experience any molding , I just make sure it dry out before I use it next . the adjustable part of it allow I to fit it to my average size tub perfectly . this be so much better than anything that hang on the bathtub wall with suction cup !
Baby	POS	5	love this change pad and the Summer Infant naturally Yours change Table Cover -lrb- sell on Amazon -rrb- fit perfectly ! I highly recommend this cover to go with this pad ; I try other that be suggest and have to send they back b\/c they be too small -lrb- b\/c of the length create by the side at either end -- the summer infant cover be 37 in . long , so it work with the side -rrb- . the pad be great -- high quality and fit my antique dresser just as I have hope .
Baby	POS	4	I be travel with 2 year old twin and already have my hand full without they run in different direction . use this to attach to we luggage -lrb- both carry on and med size -rrb- and it work wonder get we to the ticket gate , past security , and even to the rental car booth . we never have to worry about where the kid be run off to - it be very easy to install and use . we kid enjoy be able to stroll through and watch what be go on around we . we receive a ton of compliment of how smart we be to get the strap and how other wish they have think of it . great product , good quality , and a life saver !
Baby	POS	5	love this bib for the kiddo . catch the sloppy food that would otherwise be in she lap . while its flexible enough to be comfortable for the baby , its sturdy enough -lrb- unlike clothe bib -rrb- to stay in place . buy three of these and wash they after each use with dish soap and water and you 'll never have a smelly mess of bib wait to be wash -lrb- which be also very tempting for the puppy dog to get into -rrb- . in one word ; indispensable !
Baby	NEG	2	very cute but absorb everything . they probably work really well with cheerio but that be not what I need they for . pasta sauce - absorb , watermelon juice - absorb , water - absorb . I find that they do not protect clothing underneath . but they be cute !
Baby	POS	5	very helpful when kid put they dirty shoe on the back of the car 's front seat ! I would recommend it for anyone who have kid or spend time in snowy or rainy weather !
Baby	POS	4	Thought I order a blanket . do not realize a blankie be a miniature version . the granddaughter both love it , though , and enjoy snuggle and carry it around .
Baby	NEU	3	I be have a hard time with bottle for my daughter - she stop use they when I be home for summer vacation as I nurse . I find one think Baby sippy cup but it be tall - she like the spout - I buy this kit because they have different size of bottle - I also buy the sippy attachment kit - the normal nipple leak - however when I use the sippy nipple I have no problem - I like that I can just change nipple and add handle .
Baby	POS	5	1 . never irritated we baby 's skin . smell nice . 2 . you do not have to rinse it , so it be great when you hand be full or while travel -lrb- the dispenser lock in close position -rrb- . I higly recommend it . Cheers .
Baby	POS	4	the tine be not as pointy as they look in the picture . this be very nice for Oatmeal in the morning , since it do not get heat up by the food .
Baby	NEU	3	slide off the active model but keep the drool off which be the point . actually wish I would just make a couple from a old tea towel , its a waste of money to be honest .
Baby	POS	5	this be a great snuggle toy . the fabric use be very , very , soft -- that smooth yet plushy type fabric . a little doll come out of the peanut casing . he have two taggy for hair , and a blue body . the body have arm but then a round body without leg . the casing say Lil Peanut on it . as I call my daughter `` peanut '' I want she to have it for Christmas -- and she love he ! she have not learn how to take he out and put he back in , but she will bring he to I so I can do it for she . Great little toy !
Baby	POS	5	Worth the money , come from a lower income mom and a nurse , more than the best idea . just think about the money you 'll save on formulum , the pump pay for itself ; especially if you go back to work .
Baby	POS	5	my son do not take a pacifer and he do not normally use this item except when he be teethe . he will chew on this all day long when he tooth be break the gum . it work esp . well if you put it in the freezer . my son chew on the handle even more that he chew on the raz-berry part .
Baby	NEG	2	we own the original size sleep sheep when my now-5 year old be bear , and although we like the product fine , it be not a must-have . when my youngest son -lrb- now 5 month old -rrb- start show sign of colic , we buy the travel version hope that it would help he to at least rest a little while we be out and about . the product have all kind of technical difficulty - there be a timer that be suppose to allow the sound to play for either 25 or 45 minute . do not work . the machine frequently shut off after a few minute , usually right as the baby be about to go to sleep which of course wake he back up . also , I often have trouble get it to play at all and have to fiddle for 5 minute with the volume knob and try different button to get it to start . it be not the battery because we change they constantly . just a faulty unit , I be sure but for $ 25 I expect better .
Baby	POS	5	I get so many compliment when I put they on my 4 month old daughter . they be super cute and have plenty room to grow . the color go with almost anything in she wardrobe , she get lot of compliment when wear these adorable leg warmer !
Baby	POS	4	I nurse my son with the original Boppy for a year . yes , it be wonderful and everything the other reviewer say . however , my issue be that it begin to `` bend '' in the middle from use . really , this be fine ... I mean a year of nursing be go to be hard on any pillow . but my main complaint be that the cover they make for these thing be not waterproof -lrb- or spit-up proof -rrb- . what be the point of a cover ? I have to wrap my entire boppy in saran wrap , then put the cover on to get any protection nd prevent smelly stain . just my two cent .
Baby	NEG	1	now that I have have this bib for a bit I hate it ! the neck be too big , it do not adjust well , and worst of all there be some sort of stabilizer or something on the back side that be peel off . its a huge mess and I worry that one of the kid will eat some of it as it fall off . I probably wash it wrong or something , but seriously , its a bib , one that get use everyday -lrb- or use to -rrb- I need to be able to wash it in hot water .
Baby	NEG	1	I purchase this bib because the concept be great and the design be so attractive . but like other have say , only one side be laminate and so mold and stain develop and be impossible to get out . for a relatively pricey item , this be a huge disappointment . I have to toss it out and would not recommend it .
Baby	POS	5	this be we fourth bummi - we son have always be in cloth diaper and we have use bummi as the over-protector for about 2 year now . they wear well -lrb- we wash they at least 3x \/ wk . -rrb- we also use thirsty as well as the cover we diaper service give we and i think both bummi and thirsy be really solid product .
Baby	POS	5	I start cloth diaper with a rental place , get set up with pul cover , but then stumble on the wool cover world . this be my first child , I purchase two , and will never go back to PUL cover . I love how they breath , he cloth diaper even sometimes start to dry if he be nap and wet they , because of the wicking characteristic of wool ! will always use these , and I highly recommend and even try to convert friend over to wool , and cloth diapering !
Baby	POS	5	love this necklace . I be so sad that I could no longer wear jewelry because my son try to pull everything . not only be this necklace gorgeous , but my son love to play with it . I have have numerous compliment on how beautiful this necklace be . I recommend it for any mommy .
Baby	POS	5	seriously , cuter than the picture -lrb- and almost as cute as the litte girl in the picture -rrb- ! they come in a cute , partially clear pastic packaging , so that they could be display appropriately . love they !
Baby	POS	4	I purchase the large swimmus -lrb- 22-30lbs -rrb- because my 16 month old just reach the 22lbs pound range . I return it to purchase the same in medium -lrb- 15-22lb -rrb- because my son be build very thin and have no tush . the medium fit well and I think it will still accommodate he for awhile . even if it do not and I have to re-purchase the large , it be still cheaper than have to buy a pack of disposable swim diaper .
Baby	POS	5	do the job it be intend to do ... what we like about this particular product be that it have `` 4-sided wall '' where most other product only have 3 .
Baby	POS	5	when I first start my baby on food , we go through several fabric bib a day . have to use stain stick on everything before laundry day , and even with the presoak , I ruin several of my favorite coordinate bib . the only one that be sure to get clean be the white one , since I could use bleach . I read about the superbib and it seem like the solution . so , I order it , and be happy to report - this be the BEST bib ever for baby new to feeding . it be almost like plastic , but softer than that - I feed baby , rinse this in the sink , and lay it on the drainboard . by the time baby be ready to eat again , the Superbib be dry and ready . if it start look stain up , I run it in the wash machine -lrb- not dryer -rrb- , and it look good as new . I actually purchase 3 of these , one for the home , one for travel , and one for grandma 's house . I will agree with other reviewer who report that the pocket do not really catch stuff . now that baby be eat mum-mum , I find that crumb end up in the lap or highchair . the pocket do not really stick out , so do not catch anything . so , if you purpose be to catch wet food and save the traditional cloth bib , this be the product for you . if you purpose be to save the lap and highchair from dry crumb , not so much . all in all , I love it , and will be use it for some time to come .
Baby	POS	5	ship quickly and be fairly easy to put together . I do it myself , while my husband watch the little one . take I about a half hr , only because I have screw a couple of the shelf peg in the wrong spot . my husband be 6 ' 3 '' -lrb- I be 5 ' 6 '' -rrb- so I do add the wheel to it and help with the height . it be a sturdy piece of furniture . no dent or broken piece during the shipping process . the price be also why we purchase it . no where could we find one with this quality for that price . only have have it for a couple week but I would recommend this product .
Baby	NEG	1	the bowl be fine , but the suction do not work for even a minute on the smoothest plastic . definitely would not buy it again .
Baby	NEG	1	note : now there be a recall on medelum power adaptor too I own both the medelum pump in style advance and ameda 's purely yours pump . Ameda 's pump be better than medelum . see below . I do not use my medelum pump at all despite have waste about $ 300 on pump and spare part . I be a work mom so I pump a lot with baby # 1 and be do same with baby # 2 - already have a freezer full of milk . why ameda be superior to medelum : 1 -rrb- no mold growth - milk can not get into tube . see below . after I find mold on my medelum pump I go out and buy a ameda pump right away . 2 -rrb- about half the price as medelum if you just buy the pump and not the bag etc. . 3 -rrb- the ameda pump be easily freestand , also have nice slot on the pump to hold you pump milk in bottle . if you remove the medelum pump from the backpack or bag you 'll see the pump casing - the medelum pump have hole in the case around the pump so you do not really want to take it out of the bag - and nowhere to put you pump bottle so they do not fall over . FYI Ameda pump have last since 2008 with pump daily 5 days\/week -lrb- I breastfeed baby # 1 for 18 month -rrb- and it be still go great - I be use it again now . Medela know about the milk in the tube problem - in fact there be instruction about this in the booklet that come with they pump . well , I get milk back up in the tube more than once despite follow the instruction in the manual . then I have to stop pump and dry the tube out . no more pump that day as I do not have spare tube . and , to my horror , despite run the medelum pump for a couple of minute after every pump as per instruction , and dry out the tube if they get milk in they , I open the faceplate of the medelum pump one day and find mold grow on my medelum pump . that be it , I buy a ameda pump and have never go back .
Baby	POS	5	I be write from my husband 's account , but want to share how amazing this product be ! I love it and can not live without it . pump save I really , since after those first 3 day of have my baby my breast be kill I and I almost give up breastfeeding ! but I decide to give pump a shot , and it hurt a bit at first since my breast be so swollen and sensitive - but after a few try I get so use to this pump and even decide to buy a second one to maximize my pump time ! so I highly recommend , if you can afford purchase it , to buy the Avent dual electric pump , since it cost less than buy two single electric pump ... and unfortunately I do not know how much I would like pump and have to buy two singles , one first and later the second . it be amazing to be able to give my baby breast milk without go through the pain of breastfeed every 2-3 hour -lrb- my baby be a barracuda ! -rrb- . so I alternate between pump and breastfeed , and also help with pump milk once you have to return to work as well as pump for the night - if you want someone else to feed the baby and you can sleep to recover ! also I would like to add that if you do buy this pump , buy all avent product since it make it so much easier to transfer from pump to bottle , to plastic avent recipient to any other avent product ! they be all amazing and I be search amazon now for any other Avent product I do not have yet ...
Baby	POS	5	I absolutely love cute hat on baby , love . once I find these adorable ` Lil Monkey Hats , I \* know \* I have to get one for my little girl that be due in July . I purchase the ` Lil Monkey hat with pink trim and will be use it as part of she `` come home '' outfit . : -rrb- keep up the great work and I look forward to more amazing product from ya 'll . : d
Baby	NEU	3	my husband bougth it for I because I want so badly for my return to work . we live in Costa Rica and here it be so expencive that we decide to get it from amazon . the pump it be great , I be so happy that now I can extract milk in 15-20 minut and not 40 . but the box do not come with wthat I be expect , no ice pad , bag to carry the breast milk , extra diafragma or valvula . like the one I have -lrb- the single one -rrb- too bad that amazon do not give a description of the product .
Baby	POS	5	I be hesitant to buy this product - I have shower door , and no review mention door , just curtain ... I be happy to say , it do work with my shower door -lrb- see picture -rrb- and meet we need . the two tray be tight to slide together -lrb- as mention in other review -rrb- . once adjust however , I know they 'll stay put . we toy fit well inside the basket ; there be more space than I expect . my daughter have -lrb- so far -rrb- be good about pick up she toy after she bath , so I can happily announce that they be no longer scatter across the tub and floor after every bath ! I be able to move the basket to the front , middle , or rear of the tub -lrb- depend on who be use it at the time -rrb- . for those review that say this be a unsafe product - the first warning read , `` Bath Storage Basket be not to be use to assist in balance . use only as intend : to hold toy , bath care item , etc. '' I would not want my child pull themselves up on something plastic and unsecured anyway , especially in the tub . clearly it be not go to be stable unless bolt down . if you think you child will be pull themselves up , no tub storage would be a good idea for you ... or , just remove the basket during bath time . I would certainly buy this product again , or recommend it to a friend .
Baby	POS	5	I have two set -lrb- over 4 year -rrb- , and these be awesome ! of course , any suction bowl do not really stay down . you kid will figure out how to get they off ! however , these be still my favorite bowl . they be incredibly stable and sturdy , they travel well -lrb- for snack , even wet one -rrb- , and they last age . only wish I could afford 50 more , and that there be a easy way to attach the lid . I use they for a 5 and 1 year old , and have send they to work with dad , too , for salad dress .
Baby	NEG	1	horrible , the back be not at all like the package or the image shown-it be sharp edge and ridged and do not stay up in any way
Baby	NEU	3	we try everything when we daughter be teethe , include the raz-berry . at first she like the novelty of the cold , but she never get into actually chew on it . I think this may be because it be somewhat shape like a pacifier and she never take to pacifier either . also , when freeze the plastic of the raspberry do not seem to give very much . she favorite teether be Sophie the Giraffe . she also really enjoy we put ice cube in the munchkin fresh food feeder bag . she love that ! if nothing else it be always a good distraction .
Baby	POS	4	I have purchase several other waterproof pad but they be all so rough after a few wash and I do not like that against my newborn 's skin . so I purchase these , which come 2 in a pack , and they machine wash and dry well and be much softer than any of the other pad I own -lrb- I have several brands\/types -rrb- . they will not fully cover a crib or pack n play -lrb- maybe a mose bassinet -rrb- as they be not so large , but would do the trick for a change table or to put under you baby when they be in the swing or bouncer to catch any diaper leak or spit up . expensive , but I think worth it since they be so much nicer against the gentle baby skin .
Baby	POS	5	the travel toddler be a fantastic invention worth its weight in gold -lrb- or more , since it be quite light -rrb- for parent travel with young child and they car seat in the airport . we recently travel with we 2.5 year old -lrb- 30lb -rrb- and she  First year true fit convertible car seat  to transport the car seat , the travel toddler be ingenious . it attach quickly to the latch strap and top tether of you car seat to give you a easy way to roll you seat through the airport -- much easier than the GoGoKidz TravelMate , which take far more time to install . the only drawback I see of this product be : \* you need make sure you route you latch strap through in the forward face position , or they may not be long enough to reach around you suitcase -- so if you be use you car seat rear-facing , you 'll have to re-route the latch strap before reinstall it in you car . not a big deal , but take a few extra minute . \* not so much a drawback of this particular product , but of this concept in general : this strap turn you car seat into a very novel stroller , which will likely attract you toddler 's attention . sound good in concept , right ? in practice , 20lb of suitcase -lrb- or more -rrb- plus 20lb of car seat plus 30lb of toddler make for one really , really heavy contraption to be pull through the airport ! the product photo show a man push the seat and suitcase , but in reality , to get a angle that keep you child 's foot off the floor , you have you exert a fair amount of force , and at 5 ' 10 '' , I would be walk pretty bent over to accomplish that . so we pull it -- still bent over , but less awkwardly . overall , I highly recommend this product and will keep it in my travel arsenal for quite some time .
Baby	POS	5	I buy 6 of these blanket for my little guy and they be perfect . the color be exactly as picture , they be stretchy and big enough to swaddle . they be also very soft . I would recommend they to anyone !
Baby	POS	5	we use prefold with a snappie with this cover . we like the design . it be pretty gender neutral . the only difference I have notice between this cover and a thirsty duo wrap be that it do not have snap that let you adjust it even more . but , that have not really be a issue as we son fit in this pretty well . the velcro have hold up pretty good so far . just remember to use the laundry tab whe you wash they with other diaper . we find that hand wash work too and be a little faster when you be low on cover but still do not have a full load to wash diaper . overall , this cover be great !
Baby	POS	5	this light blue one look like a scarf on my daughter . Navy and Red look like western bandana -lrb- so cute ! -rrb- . absorb like a dream . well make . Wish all we bib be these ... we would only need 3 per day instead of 6 of the cheapo . I have 7 in different color and use 1 per day . I save it for when we go out so that she still look cute and she outfit be not ruin by a ugly\/huge bib . if only I could afford 21 of these ! -lrb- have to buy some color directly from silly Billy 's website , but shipping be cheap there . -rrb- love
Baby	NEG	1	there be no way to mark the correct position of both piece so they would fit together properly . after ruin one piece by put it in the wrong position , we put mask tape on the back of it to line it up with the second piece . that work as a trial -lrb- and something we should have do first -rrb- but when both latch and catch be properly line up , the door would not unlock , as the cabinet door be evidently too thick , although the writeup say the lock would work on door up to one inch ... we give up , think about screw they on , but decide it be not worth the trouble . if you want to use the magnetic lock , be sure you cabinet door be less than one inch thick . a waste of money on we part . tome
Baby	NEG	2	I be hope that these would be thicker . they be super thin ... much thinner than a cheap hotel washcloth . I think I 'll be better off folding a burp cloth over the Bjorn front flap so we little one can chew on it without the saliva soak through . I be expect the bib to be more substantial than this , especially for the price .
Baby	POS	5	this be we first time travel with we little one , but I can not even imagine have to have carry two carseat and all we carry on and manage a wander 2 year old and a bossy 4 year old . for the time where we have to unstrap the seat to get on the plane , I be eternally grateful for the strap make it so easy to get through the rest of the airport . a MUST BUY for everyone with little one !!
Baby	POS	5	we have be use the standard child lock throughout we house but we have a few drawer where the countertop overhung too much and we could not get we finger in between to unlock the drawer . these magnet lock work perfectly . I would like to put these throughout the house if they be cheaper . they work really well but its a good idea to order some extra magnet key . my wife keep lose they throughout we house and we get lock out of we drawer !
Baby	POS	5	I purchase this mobile for my new grandbaby and she love it ! it hold she attention and be very attractive .
Baby	POS	5	I have use fuzzibunz -lrb- which we love -rrb- and bum genious as well as prefold and other CD brand . I have the opportunity to review this diaper and i have to say when i first see its desing i be apprehensive . be use to pocket diaper where you stuff the insert , the way this be to be put together throw I off , but alas i try it out . and boy be i suprised . first the soaker be super duper absorbant . so much so that they last thorugh the night without any leak at all !!! I have yet to be able to accomplish this with any other CD unless i put like 4 soaker and my little man have a huge fluffly butt . one soaker pad be all it take i do not even have to double the soaker . needless to say i be in love with this diaper and the design we get be beyond cute .
Baby	POS	4	my 4 month old boy love this . it really help to settle he and will watch it for a hour ! I wish it play for longer than 15 minute but there be a remote to restart it from the doorway . one downside be that I have to oil it ! it squeak SO loudly when turn I have to turn it off . still , it be fine since I oil it : -rrb- .
Baby	POS	4	very useful to have velcro attachment . imagine pull off a wet , dirty diaper with only elastic at the waist -- messy ! I plan to buy the next size when he outgrow this one .
Baby	POS	4	this be a all around fun teethe product . my son love gnawing on it when he gum be bother he and I love watch he ! the rippled silicone texture be awesome for chew but be careful , it also have a tendency to pick up any fuzz or lint that come off blanket , sweater , teddy bear etc. . . I find myself have to wash it off every time it leave he mouth . aside from that , it be great - we have several !
Baby	POS	5	in 2008 we unexpectedly find out we be have identical twin which would be we 3rd and 4th child . we be a one income household so that I could be a stay at home mom so I do not have $ 400 to $ 700 to spend on a twin stroller that start at the infant stage . if you be just begining you research or be purchase for a loved one who be expect , please note that very few double stroller will actually accommodate infant twin . this stroller be amazing . it be easy to assemble -lrb- take only 30 minute -rrb- and customize to you car seat . it fold up very flat -lrb- much more so than a regular double stroller -rrb- . it be very lightweight and pop out to full size with no problem . I have have it in a car trunk and the back of the van so it can go in multiple vehicle size . I think the absolute best part be the convenience factor . my twin be bear in December so it be such a comfort not to have to take they out of a nice warm car seat and put they into a cold stroller seat . you simply lift you car seat off the base and pop it into the stroller and lock it down . baby remain undisturbed and out of the element . the car seat also help to shield they from people and germ when they do have to be in public . I would pull the sun shield up and lay a blanket over it and drape it over the handle to deter people from lean over the baby . Trust I - you can not be too protective when they have be in the NICU . the maneuverability be also better than average . it get around a lot easier than the double stroller I have now - probably due to it be weight . I would push it into the exam room at the doctor and it make it simple to do one baby exam at a time . I do not always have the luxury of have someone to accompany I when I have to get out with the twin and this system make it easy to do by myself with confidence . the metal frame also work for be creative with option . I purchase a screw on umbrella from CVS that fit on the frame and it work as a excellent sun shield for summer . the large basket underneath be big enough for a large diaper bag and my purse . all in all , the value , design , resell and convenience of this can not be beat . you have to buy car seat so this just maximize they use and value as well . I wish I have know about the single option when my first child be bear and I would have purchae it instead of the crappy `` stroller system '' that I overpay and underutilize due to it be multiple design flaw . if you go with this one you will not regret it .
Baby	POS	4	OMG -- possibly the cutest thing I have buy for my little . he be a big boy , though , and , unfortunately , these pajamas purchase for he at about 8 month be quickly too small .
Baby	NEU	3	I have install some of the original Mommy 's Helper Safe-Lok and the new one with the disable feature . neither of they be particularly straightforward to install , but once you do one the other be a lot easier . I find both kind of Safe-Lok to be much more effective than any of the four kind of Safety First cabinet lock I try -lrb- the Safety First one break if you pull the cabinet too hard , as you might do if you forget the lock be on -rrb- . while the disable feature sound great , they change the design slightly and it be not as good as the original . the mount bracket be much harder to install than the original , but more importantly , the reclose protection feature do not work on these new one -lrb- it work great on the original -rrb- . you have the option of not use the disable feature and mount the lock arm directly onto the cabinet without the outer mount bracket , but the design of the lock arm be change in a few subtle way that still render the reclose feature ineffective . I would highly recommend get the original Safe-Lok without the disable feature .
Baby	NEU	3	this be super adorable , and fit you shoulder well , but it be not very absorbent for baby who have excessive spit up .
Baby	NEG	2	portability , I give a 5 ! but the suction noise be extremely loud , my boyfriend even ask if there be a additional knob to turn the volume down lol . the suction be pretty good , though . even so , it seem to give out after 20minute . it be not that many part , but there be a little blue piece that you have to make sure not to lose , it be essential to the pump . . but they include a spare .
Baby	POS	5	we dd start have reflux on she second week and the one thing that seem to sooth she be a plain vacuum cleaner or a hair dryer , but we end up all annoyed !! ... we day care provider tell we about the sleep sheep and we actually have receive it as a gift but have not really use it on those ocassion where we dd be unconsolable due to the reflux ... this thing work !!! it make she so calm and every time she look sleepy we just start some ocean wave sound and we feel sleepy with she too !! ... also , this one be the small one and it be so practical to take in the car , the stroller , the swing , the crib ... anywhere ... so we have one for day care and one for home ... at first I do not think it would work but it do , and wonderfully ...
Baby	NEU	3	I buy this brush because I be a big fan of the Dr. Brown bottle . I think this brush clean the bottle very effectively until it start to show wear and tear after a few month . in all honesty , this brush last for about 8 month for I , but we do not use it daily to clean bottle , as most of the time we run the bottle through the dishwasher . the sponge start to break down , which be not a big deal as sponge do not last too long , but the wire stem be pretty flimsy out of the box and just break today .
Baby	NEG	1	just like the other have say , the cushion on this potty get so nasty . it just absorb any fluid waste . just plain yucky . and you can not use the potty without the cushion ! I have try soak it in bleach water , but who want to do that every day ? the bleach break down the cushion make it feel sticky\/gummy . bad , bad , bad .
Bag	NEU	3	I have two canon body with vertical grip , 2 flash , and three lens with another one on the way . they do not all fit . I have the 580 ex ii , 480 ex , 70 - 200 mm , 50 mm , and 17 - 40 mm -lrb- all l lens -rrb- for canon . I do not have enough space for the second flash or the 50 mm . I have to keep one camera body portable -lrb- which be fine for out on assignment , but not when in storage -rrb- .
Bag	POS	4	most tote be a little dowdy , but I like the way this one look and feel . it be sturdy and it hold lot of stuff : from my computer to several book , file , and the all-important lunch .
Bag	NEG	2	this tool bag be high quality and durable , but I like my tool to stand up in pocket . you tool in this bag must lay flat in most all case . small tool and a small quantity may be put into pocket but in the most part you just have to through they in the bottom of the bag and dig .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this bag when they first come out cause I be tire of lug around that heavy laptop bag that weigh like it have a couple laptop in it even when mine be not in it : -rrb- this bag be durable , laptop area be cushion with a clasp so it cant fall out . zippered mesh inside pocket , it be get drag around across the US and still look new !!
Bag	POS	4	I go to a department store to find a camera bag , unfortunately they do not stock Targus . but I do come across the Case Logic dc50 case . I like it .  layout and size : it have a great accessory pouch -lrb- with mesh pocket , not sure how durable they be -rrb- . a zip pocket big enough for 2 canon battery and memory card , + another pocket for memory , and room for aa battery -lrb- if applicable -rrb- . there be padding everywhere as far as I could feel , although it be quite thin -lrb- all case I see have as thinner or thinner padding -rrb- . the inner -lrb- camera -rrb- pocket be approximately 15cm -lrb- 6in ? -rrb- high , 8cm -lrb- a bit more than 3in -rrb- wide and 4.5 cm -lrb- less than 2 in -rrb- deep -lrb- these be rough measurement with a ruler -rrb- .  for Canon S30 : \* it be a little large for the Canon s30 as you can tell from my rough measurement . however , with the all weather case it might be about right -lrb- do not know yet -rrb- . \* to give you a rough idea ... if the camera be still in bubble wrap then it be almost the right size -lrb- except for height -rrb- .  if you find a better case for the s30 , then let I know : - -rrb- otherwise I will happily use the dc50 case : - -rrb-  if the height be too big you could always put some extra padding down the bottom of the bag . for example just cut some bubble wrap to size and put it at the bottom of the comparment .
Bag	POS	4	I be look for a case for my Dewalt nailer . Dewalt do not offer one . Came across this bag and it be a perfect fit .
Bag	NEG	2	it amaze I that people be give this tool more than a one or two star rating . it can not be use for over 2 hour without begining to fail . it show that most user be either not use the tool long enough before give a review , or the normal project people use the tool for be very short duration . this sander be size and shape perfectly for easy handling and general all position use . when the sander be new I use it to sand a maple butcher block top . after a hour or so the sander be spit black graphite piece all over the white wood top stain the surface . the sander be hop around like the wheel be square ! I remove the belt to inspect the sander . the friction pad be disintegrate . the wheel be clump with fragment from the die pad . I have to finish the job with my old $ 49.00 Skil which be very light duty , but finish the job . I send the sander in to be repair under warranty . I get some resistance from the repair people , but they do put a new pad on , and replace a wheel . I have since use the sander for very light use type job of short duration . last week I have another job which require continuous use for 3 hour sand a fiberglass body panel flat . I use no down pressure only gravity to weight the sander . it last 2 hour before spit out carbon flake again . the wheel be cake with graphite lump again and the lead 25 % of the pad be wear down again . this pad design be lack for any project require continuous use over a hour or so . it look like I may need a heavier duty tool to use for any surface type job . this one be only good for sand edge or small lump off of surface . the cost be too high for such a light duty tool . I hope they abandon the carbon pad for future offering . the plastic back bone inside the dust bag fail on my sander also . it have small ear that attach to the inlet socket . the ear be very small diameter and lack robustness . I hope Bosch can refine this sander , as it be a good handling tool and would fit the need of many a craftsman .
Bag	POS	4	awesome tool bag . perfect size for drill and other tool that I prefer to carry . Heavy , durable canvas and no problem w\/zipper as other reviewer have claim . only downfall be that bottom of bag will sag - use 2 piece of cardboard wrap in duct tape to keep from sag .
Bag	POS	4	before puchase this tool bag , I take the time to read the review on this site . after receive and use it , I couldnt ' be more satisfied . it be everything I expect it to be . it have plenty of room and pocket to organize my tool and its nice not to have to dig down in the bottom of the bag to find the one you need . have not have it long enough to see how it will hold up , but it look to be very well construct . I plan on get another .
Bag	POS	5	although a seam fail shortly after start use of this toolbag , I think it be a anomaly because I have a GateMouth Longboy that have endure a lot of hard use and the replacement Jr. bag be hold up just fine . both bag be light-weight but very strong and easy to carry . I do use the pocket sew into the bag but find that a couple of inexpensive office supply store pencil box work well to orgainize and protect my smaller tool and supplies . the GateMouth line of tool bag be very good quality and I recommend it highly .
Bag	NEG	2	while a great concept , this dust collection bag prove of little worth to my dust collection effort . I find that hook my shop vac up to the dust ejection port on the back of my Bosch table saw be infinitely better than this bag , which only collect about 50-60 % of the sawdust
Bag	POS	5	this bag be rugged and large enough to easily fit my Hitachi Framing gun without any trouble . there be even room to put some other loose tool on top if you wish\/need to . the strap a tough and the correct size to carry over the shoulder at waist height . I be very glad I get this to help offer some protection to my frame gun -lrb- especially when load it into the truck , you know how everything end up pile on-top of everything else -rrb- . the only thing that could be better would be for frame gun to include hard case when you buy they -lrb- I do not know any maker who do so -rrb- . I highly recommend this product .
Bag	NEG	2	this be a well build product but it will just hold you camera and battery . it will not handle the cable need to support the camera or the power supply which be a must in most case . the battery do not last long enough for most outing . it be basically the size of a small hardcovered novel !
Bag	POS	5	firstly , let I say I get this sander from amazon for about 40 buck less than the sale price offer at local store ; plus free shipping . such a Deal ! this thing work great . Square shape make it easy to get up alongside wall . variable speed dial and lock button allow you to run the thing and put you hand anywhere on the sander . lot of speed and power . Easy on the hand . the dust bag attachment seem to work well , but be anything really dust proof ? I also put this thing upside down in a vise -lrb- with a towel around the vise jaw -rrb- and use it as a stationary sander . and for those who care , it be not make in Taiwan or China by underpaid foreign worker , but in Switzerland . hopefully by well-paid immigrant worker . I be not a contractor , so I haven ` nt torture test this thing , but if you be a homeowner who want to have the kid fight over you tool when you be go , or simply want to have a impressive estate sale , you can not beat this sander . it be way better to buy this baby and have it for life , rather than buy 50 buck sander from the hardware store every few year .
Bag	POS	5	... this case actually have a hidden rain jacket to protect you electronic equipment -lrb- worth probably hundred if not thousand of dollard -rrb- from the element . the inside material be also design not to scratch lcd display and it be quite a rugged case for such a little bag . oh and do I forget to mention that it have a belt loop on the back so you can wear it around you waist and that the hardware be metal instead of plastic . a bag that be really design to last . Great for digital still camera and a few accessore like card and a small battery charger or axillary lens . highly recomend for digital camera .
Bag	POS	4	I get this to store my Bostitch f21pl frame nailer  bostitch f21pl Round Head 1-1\/2 - Inch to 3-1\/2 - Inch Framing Nailer with positive Placement Tip and Magnesium Housing  it be a tight fit , but the zipper close and the frame nailer will be a lot happier in the bag , dust free , and hopefully free of the dent and ding it would receive it it be rattle around the back of my truck unprotected . I like the gunner bag and can recommend it . here be some point base on my use and observation : pro : \* size - this bag should fit just about any pneumatic nailer you have . the Bostitch I get it for be about as big as the other guy that shoot round head frame nail : Hitachi , Senco , Porter Cable , etc. . Mine fit best upside down , with the business end point toward the peak of the bag , on top . naturally , it will fit many smaller nailer , too , like a roofing nailer or a couple of finish nailer . \* well make - the material of the bag be rugged ripstop nylon and it seem to be put together well enough . stitch be mostly single and while the zipper be not particularly heavy duty -lrb- it be a nylon type - not metal -rrb- , it should last long enough . the handle be make of nylon webbing and will probably outlast other component of the bag . \* it be padded - I like this feature , for in addition to keep the dust off the tool , I also want the bag to afford it protection from bang and bump when it be ride along with my other tool in the back of the pickup . the side be not heavily padded , but it be enough to make a difference . while the bottom be not pad it do have a strip of rigid plastic run the length of the bag which should offer some protection as well . \* Versatile - The bag come with one pocket on the outside -lrb- which be where a bottle of my pneumatic tool oil life -rrb- and a couple of small pocket inside . give that it be already a tight fit inside for a full-size framing nailer and the fact that the interior pocket be fairly small , I do not see much practical purpose to these ; I would prefer to have another , larger , pocket on the exterior -lrb- perhaps with a closeable flap ? -rrb- where I could store the tip cover , sequential-fire trigger , etc. . the bag come with a nylon shoulder strap so you can carry the bag over you shoulder to free up you hand . this may or may not be useful depend on how you use the bag , but it be nice to have the option . con : \* value - this be purely subjective , but it seem that this bag should be less expensive than it be . be it handy ? yes , it be . be it essential ? well , no , I do not think it be . at the time of this writing , the bag represent about 13 % of the cost of the tool it be carry . I leave it to you to decide whether that be a good value or not . I have use Bucket Boss product in the past and they be still go strong , but that be carry dozen of tool , day in , day out , everywhere . this gunner bag be go to be carry one tool , occasionally , so the value proposition for I be not as sweet as it could be . \* gate mouth - I need to review the meaning of what gate mouth be , because I think that mean a opening that get bigger due to a semi-rigid opening that make the open to the bag much bigger . this bag do not have that , but instead it have a zipper that run the length of the bag . do it matter ? the zipper work just fine , and the bag swallow my framing nailer , so I guess not . still , my expectation be different from what the product actually be . -lrb- I 'll allow that I may be confuse about the meaning , for sure -rrb- other thought : I do not see this as a essential item , but it be nice to have depend on you use . I be a contractor , but not a full-time rough carpenter or framer , so I will not be use my framing nailer on a daily basis . in my shop , this gunner bag will be protect my tool from dust and bump until I use it again . if I be to use my frame nailer every day , I do not know that I would spend the money on protect the tool that would basically get use to death and then toss . professional framer , what do you think ? for this reviewer , this be a good and useful bag that I be happy I purchase . yes , I think it could have be have for less give that the quality be ok but not fantastic , the material be decent but not top quality -lrb- zipper -rrb- , and it be make in China . -lrb- not to knock China in this case , but while they manufacture this bag about as well as anyone , let 's face it : it cost the factory penny on the dollar to produce this item -rrb-
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this bag for a Sony trv30 camcorder and overall be happy with it .  pro : - small - light - weatherproof -lrb- havent actually test it yet , but the retractable hood be a nice touch -rrb-  con : - small - not enough pocket - when wear a t-shirt , the hair on my hand get catch up in the strap attachment -lrb- painful and annoying and I be not even that hairy ! -rrb-  overall , if the constraint dont scare you away , I think its a pretty nice bag .
Bag	POS	5	man , these bag be great ! I fit a lot of my personal tool in here and have to take some out because the whole be too heavy ! I love the durable cloth ; I love the shoulder strap ; but what I like most be the use of space . there be a neat set of strap on top for a 2 ' level . there be organizational pocket on the inside for pencil , chisel , and whatnot .  there be a lot of room . they be not kid when they say you can fit a sawzall in there .
Bag	POS	5	a excellent tool bag for my pneumatic gun . well make at a affordable price . I have use it for over a year , no problem .
Bag	NEU	3	product seem to work fine , however I would like the item to be exactly like the picture . the one that be send to I have a cheap look bag attach which do not look like the picture . it do not have the black support or even Bosch write on it anywhere . -lrb- say cheap generic bag if that be what you be go to include with the product -rrb-
Bag	POS	5	I be pleasantly suprised when my long heavy gauge jumper cable fit easily into this bag and now behind the seat be a lot neater ...
Bag	POS	5	this bag look great and now that i have use it for several day , I love it . I have be look for a ` general use ' bag forever . I need a bag that could act as a carry all and as a book bag , and laptop bag . its great . someone comment i think , on the weight distribution . it all depend on hwo you load the bag . I be carry at least 25 lb . in book today all day and it be fine . also all the neat little pocket be wonderfull . room for everything you need . only one little complaint , my Sprint PCS gen 1 phone be a little too tall for the cell pouch , but otherwise , great !
Bag	NEG	1	simple to install and pretty effective . the only draw back be that sliver of scap wood can easily block the `` sawdust tunnel '' that feed the dust into the catcher . empty easily .
Bag	POS	5	this little bag have extend the life of we camcorder in numerous fall off the table , drop , bang around in the trunk , etc. . nicely pad , have lot of storage for the extra such as more tape , charger , etc. . well worth every penny for this camcorder insurance !
Bag	NEU	3	well ... it look bigger in the picture . be Bosch I would have expect the material to be a little more durable . it do catch 60 to 70 percent of the sawdust as advertised but you have to empty the bag often . I feel it be not worth what I pay -lrb- $ 12 and change -rrb- . six or seven dollar would be a good price for this item .
Bag	POS	5	track excellent even on it be back . can run the belt right to the edge for tight corner . recommend despite the price .
Bag	POS	5	this be the third 3 '' belt sander I have own and it be by far the best . the 9903 be fairly light and the handle allow good control . it be indeed very quiet consider the power . I be very pleased at the 16 ' power cord . Belt change be not a problem . and boy do this thing suck - I mean excellent dust collection . sand belt tracking be good and easy to adjust . this be a very nice sander . I wish all of my purchase tool do what they be suppose to do .
Bag	POS	4	I look at both the smaller bag and this one and for the money I would purchase the larger size . the smaller one be quite a bit smaller and most people would be dissapoint .
Bag	POS	5	I store my jumper cable under the rear seat of my pick-up . if I ever need to move they , they get catch up in everything , and flop around like a angry snake . well no more . this tidy little bag be perfect . well make , perfect size for any gauge -lrb- I have 2 of they - the other one for my 2 gauge tractor-winch lead -rrb- . 5 star .
Bag	POS	4	we have find this to be a very convenient way of transport essential tool from one job to the next . the bag be roomy and be great for any kind of tool . we be presently use the bag to carry we battery operate circular saw , which fit very nicely into the bag .
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this Bosch belt sander to sand base board and other trim . the wood be all yellow Pine so far . I like the smooth running of the belt and the sander do not seem to work hard . I will be sand Oak trim in the future and that might work the sander , if it do not work as well on Oak I 'll be post another opinion . my only complaint be the power trigger be located such that when you pick up the tool you finger depress the trigger and so start the sander . of course I have learn to allow for this and now I do not pick it up as I would other power tool . oh ... I own other Bosch power tool , router , power hand see , and find they to be well make too . oh I purchase the the fence and stand for the sander , well worth the money . I look forward to use this sander for year to come . Larry
Bag	POS	4	this sander have plenty of power for its size , and the vacuum bag actually suck up quite a bit of the dust without spray it right back in you face . track be decent and the fact that the right side and top be flat and ready to be clamp down to any available surface make it great for occasional bench sanding . what I do not like be how off-balance it be -- it really like to roll toward the leave on account of the motor 's weight and it be pretty hard to tell whether or not you be hold it level until it be too late . compound this problem with the fact that the optional sand shoe\/frame be both $ 114 extra and discontinued and you have get some pretty heavy con . I make my own frame out of 3\/4 '' mdf , but it be obviously pretty heavy and not especially durable . I also have a problem with the placement of the speed adjustment knob -- it get coated in dust almost instantly and become impossible to read without a shot of compress air . I worry about how long it will last before the potentiometer fizzle out . there seem to be a awful lot of review of belt sander from all manufacturer where customer complain about Amazon ship they a use unit as new . I too suspect this have happen to I upon open the box as mine be cover in what appear to be sawdust . a closer inspection however reveal that this be in fact just cardboard that have get sand by the belt as the unit be throw around during shipping . no harm , no foul . if you plan on do a lot of leveling , I would consider the DeWalt as you can pick up they frame just about anywhere . otherwise , there be quite a bit of bang for you buck here . it look boxy and awkward , but those bad look really add to the versatility of the machine . UPDATE : just talk to Makita on the phone and they confirm that the sand shoe accessory be no longer be make by anyone and they have no plan to design or produce a replacement model . Boo .
Bag	POS	4	this be a great item . however , I find it a bit small in diameter for a set of serious cable .
Bag	POS	5	this Bucket Boss be very functional for automotive use and be a top quality construction . I recommend they product !
Bag	POS	5	great sander . lightweight , great if you have to one hand something or if you have to sand vertically or overhead . the tracking adjuster work like a champ . change belt be super fast and easy . only complaint be the dust-bag ... it seem kind of cheesy compare to how well build the rest of the sander be , but I buy a sander , not a dust collector . make in Switzerland .
Bag	POS	5	I be pretty skeptical before buy this , but the review be all great , so i try .  and this be a very good stuff : I can put my dell notebook there and some book , plus a few shirt to tavel overnight . I even use to to go to office .  this be just the good bag i need . very highly recommend .
Bag	POS	5	I now have two Bucket Boss , Jr. bag and I find they to be the perfect size and rugged . the bigger these satchel be , the more I try to stuff into they , which end up with too heavy a bag and too much stuff dump in it . I like have smaller , label carryall so I can stay organize , even when I be work quickly .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this sander for heavy duty sanding of hickory . it be very quiet . have enough power , if use 40 grit paper , that it pull so hard it wear out my employee . the tracking be top quality . the long power cord be a plus . I own over 2 dozen Makita tool and this will not disappoint .
Bag	POS	5	this tool bag  DEWALT D6050 17-Inch Ballistic Nylon Tool Bag  the factory supply storage box be find to be low quality when compare to the cost of this combo set . also , try to put all tool back into the storage container and be able to close it be next to impossible . all tool fit nicely in this tool bag , and , be very easily put back in and completely close when finish these tool .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be wonderful . I buy my husband new 16 foot cable and they fit very easily and neatly into this bag . keep it organize in the trunk and easy to find . highly recommend .
Bag	POS	5	this be a suberb case for the price . complete with a allweather cover for `` rought situation '' this case be ideal for a digital camera or a regular camera . I currently have a Nikon Coolpix 800 digital camera and it fit perfectly . the case be a great size because it be not to small where it can not hold anything and not to big where it be a nusiance to lag around . another good thing be the ability for the case to attatch to a belt . the soft inside of the case offer superb protection with the gentleness not to damage the camera 's lcd . it also have two laminated pocket which be perfect for hold extra memory card . the divider be great for create a perfectly size spot for you camera seperates\/and allow access to the extra space to store all the accessory for you camera . my personal favorite feature be that the case be zipper to prevent anyone from steal you camera . a beautifully craft camera case at a terrific price .
Bag	POS	5	I be a woodcarver and I use the Gatemouth to transport work in progress , along with my tool , on trip , etc. . it be roomy and also sturdy enough to protect the contents .
Bag	POS	5	when I first receive this case , the sheer size of the packaging throw I off - feel like it be another piece of check-in luggage ! however , have use it for a few week for my slr -lrb- Nikon D-80 -rrb- , the case actually do a perfect job of protect the camera , lens , and other accessory . any smaller and I think it would have be non-functional for my camera . the availability of pocket pretty much all over help store accessory . overall I really like this case and I know my camera and lens be secure in it .
Bag	POS	4	I use this mainly to carry tool and hardware between the house and -lrb- detach -rrb- garage . I can load it with a hammer drill , cordless drill\/driver , etc. . it have various inner and outer pocket and divider to carry hand tool and hardware . it appear well-made and heavy duty , good value .
Bag	POS	5	I think that this be a great bag for the price . I have a d90 , the kit zoom lens , a nikon55-300mm ed , a sb700 , and quite a few small accessory in this bag . it be a snug fit , but I do not have any trouble close the bag , and if I add much more stuff it would be too heavy to carry around all day any way . the strap be very comfortable , and I like the front flap system . I can fit battery , some other junk , and even a pocket camcorder . I be not really sure why some people would write critical review of this bag due to it be size . it be a small bag , and sell as such . if you need a bigger bag , just buy a bigger bag . would you write a critical review of a pair of size 9 shoe for be to small because you wear size 10 ?
Bag	POS	5	when you invest hundred of dollar on tool you want the best protection and convenience and this be exactly what I be look for in a bag for my MAX sn890rh nailer . as other have state , this bag stand up on its own due to the rigid bottom . make of heavy duty material , small pouch inside the bag for hold you oil , pocket on the outside for hold glove or whatever you need . I order mine from Lewis contractor supply and they price be a few cent cheaper than Amazon 's price and it be not the side-zip model that someone else have get . glad I buy it and worth every penny .
Bag	POS	4	after get my new Canon , I go to LowePro 's site to find the perfect bag , have use they product for we previous camera . they camera matrix make this a snap . three model be list as the best fit , and I could only find this one locally -lrb- which I need , to try it out -rrb- . the 30 be quite large for my camera , but enable I to load it bottom-down , rather than on-edge like several of the other I try . when unzipped , you can access all storage area , include two small pouch in front for spare memory card -lrb- they would easily hold 6 cf card -rrb- . the bag have a cushion , fleece interior , with a separate small pocket for spare aa . the main storage area also come with a removable cushion divider which attach with velcro , so you can subdivide the camera area as you wish . when I be try the camera on-edge I use it , but once I place the camera in bottom-first , I do not need it . for the s1 there be quite a bit of room on top . another add feature be the all-weather cover which be hide in the outside back of the case . pull out , it fit over the case like a rainhat , keep you camera and other item dry . Pretty cool . the shoulder strap be removable and well-designed , and the case also have a triple velcro belt-loop affair , if you would like to hang it closer . this case be probably too large for I to attempt that , but I like have the option . the 25 be another case which should fit my Canon s1 , but since I could not find it locally I buy this case , and be please with it . Ritz Camera : $ 29.99 Amazon : $ 20.84
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this cable bag in conjunction with Coleman Cable Systems 08660 20 ' heavy duty 4-gauge Jumper Cables -lrb- also sell by Amazon -rrb- . this bag swallow the 20 foot of four gauge cable and can easily accomodate a longer , heavier cable . the product dimension be 13 inch in diameter x 4 inch in depth . Bucket Boss make high quality product that will satisfy the most demand consumer . if you would like to protect you booster cable and reduce clutter , this product do a outstanding job .
Bag	NEG	1	I do multiple install in a day and any product that can save I time make I money . clean up be a requirement and I be hope this bag would at least help with contain the pile of sawdust that my bosch table create . it do not . in fact , the bag will catch about a 1\/3 or less and then because you have cover the exhaust hole , the sawdust will then blow back thru the blade opening into you face , even with the blade barely expose over you material . this blow back of course cause a dust cloud around the saw . its faster to clean up a large pile of sawdust on the ground from the exhaust hole than clean up a 5 ' area all around the saw from that dust cloud create by use the bag . it look nice and be big enough , but doesnt do the job at all .
Bag	NEU	3	Greg sorry to disagree but this case be too big -lrb- in height not in width -rrb- for a Canon Powershot a20 . I like the batterie holder though .  one other thing I hate about this case , be the belt thing ... you have to remove you belt to put this case or to remove it ... too bad ...
Bag	POS	5	a great bag with all the protection you would want for you gear . would be a little tight for two body and all the related gear . quality construction throughout . Amazon give great service again and the bag arrive in a timely manner . I would definitely buy this bag again .
Bag	NEU	3	I search the world over for a nice , inexpensive bag to bring to Japan , to be use as a carry-on for the plane , a purse , and a overnight bag , all in one trip . I have a couple of problem . First of all , the padding intend to keep a laptop out of harm way take up quite a bit of unnecessary space , when a laptop be not be use . secondly , as a purse , while easy to get into and out of -lrb- and water resistant , I might add ! -rrb- the strap be uncomfortable after be carry for more than a hour -- especially if there be anything of significant weight in the bag . but , on the whole , I be glad I buy the bag , and would do it again -- I would just put some padding on the strap before I leave ! -lrb- fit nicely in the overhead compartment of plane , train , bus , etc. -rrb-
Bag	POS	4	this be the second one of these handy bag that I have purchase . my son snag my first one and it be still go strong after eight or more relatively hard year skid back and forth across the bed of a pick-up -lrb- why he do not tie it down I will never understand !! -rrb- . I do notice that the material have change since my last purchase but this latest stuff be refer to as `` rip stop '' and it seem tough enough . my first bag have a few scuff mark but no rip what so ever . this be a very practical sort of thing to own in that everyone need a emergency kit in they vehicle . if you do not want various and sundry thing adrift and roll around in you trunk or underneath a seat in you car , this bag be for you . there be enough room in the bag for I to have in addition to 14 ' eight gauge jumper , a 25 ' tow strap 2 '' wide with two hook plus a handful of chemlite . there be a small pocket on the front of the bag that you can most probably find a use for . add a decent first aid kit and you 'll be better able to handle `` problem '' that may come you way . `` be prepare , '' winter be almost upon we .
Bag	POS	5	the Tamrac System 3 -lrb- and other `` System '' -rrb- bag be very well craft camera bag . the bag have several very attractive feature .  -- handle and strap be strong and very comfortable . -- access to bag be easy , zipper very smooth , clip easy to manage . -- Main body of bag can be reconfigure with velcro separator . -- surprisingly high capacity -lrb- I carry a slr body with standard lens , a 75-300 zoom , spare short focal length lens , hot shoe full flash and digital 6x zoom camera all in central pocket -rrb- -- several additional useful separator , film holder , documentation , place for lens cleaner , paper or cloth -rrb- -- durable outer shell that can take some abuse  all of this be contain in what appear from the outside to be a very small bag that easily store for travel . perhaps most importantly the separator , outer shell , and body construction real do appear to protect you equipment -lrb- yes I be ashamed to admit that I have have my fully load bag drop off of table and down step -rrb- . do not buy more bag than you need . if you have get a reasonable amount of gear this bag probably can handle it .
Bag	POS	5	this be a great all around bag for the average ameture photographer . lot of room for a body and up to a 300 mm lens .
Bag	POS	5	I love these bag . I have a great Pyrenees and along with that Great be the size of he poop . I can pick up he pile with one bag . I have large hand and they fit in the bag ok .
Bag	NEG	1	after use this thing 5 time , it quit . it be suppose to have a one year warranty . I send it back 3 month after purchase . after wait 10 week , it be ready for return , except they want $ 40 for the repair . it turn out the switch go bad , and it and several other item be not cover after 30 day . that be not mention anywhere when I purchase it . I will never buy another Bosch tool again . by the way , I be 58 and this be the first time I have ever have a switch go bad on a tool . I be not be not a commercial user .
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this dust collection bag when I purchase my Bosch 4100 tablesaw . this tablesaw go on almost every job with I and I like have the dust collection bag so that I be not sweep up as much sawdust at the end of the day .
Bag	POS	5	I love Bucket Boss product . this be just a unique and well design product ! I use mine to hold a 50 foot heavy gauge extension cord plus a 20 foot medium gauge with three outlet and a wrench to change the blade on my  Skil SHD77M 15 Amp 7-1\/4 - Inch Mag Worm Drive circular saw  it would easily fit a couple of smaller extension cord along with the one already store in it , or carpenter pencil , utility knife and speed square as a cut guide ! I love the feeling of have my sloppy extension cord neatly stow away in this bag . it also make carry they to the jobsite much easier and I do not have to worry about the cord tangle during storage or transportation . I love the extra pocket for tool storage , this really extend the usability of the product . you can have you extension cord , jumper cable and whatever tool be specific for you application together in one compact unit ! I think this be a excellent solution and the bag be construct as to live up to the Bucketboss reputation for durability ! now I just need to get one for each of the car !
Bag	POS	5	this be a excellent sander . I really work this machine and it just keep on go . Brace you foot , hang on tight and keep on move ; this be a powerful sander . I usually sand with three grits and when change belt it be rarely necessary to touch the tracking adjustment . the 4 inch footprint be more resistant to tip than my 3 inch sander and ergonomics be perfect for I . con : there be 2 flat spot on the metal front roller 180 degree apart which cause a barely discernible bump but it be not really a problem . it just sometimes make it hard to tell if a belt be about to separate or not . recommend .
Bag	POS	5	I use the Makita 9903 to sand down 2 loft bed that I build and it work just fine . very easy to use freehand or clamp down to be use as table sander . change the belt sandpaper be a snap . adjust the belt tracker be easy and once set , it stay without drift off . variable speed be simple to use and effective . the release on the saw dust collection bag be not a zipper but a slide device which work nicely .
Bag	POS	5	this be the second bag I have own , and it be great . I look at a lot of bag and this be easily the best one . I have a 35mm camera , three lens , flash , lens doubler , and other accessory . I be able to fit everything in it with some room to spare . the bag be durable , light weight , and the construction be top notch . there be plenty of protection for you gear - lot of foam and the bottom be hard under the foam to protect against penetration from underneath . get to you gear be easy with the single front clip , yet you can make also make it more secure with the zipper . all zipper be cover for protection from dirt . even fully load the bag be easy to carry with either the handle or shoulder strap . I be very pleased with this bag and definitely recommend it .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be simply one of the most marvellous ! Easy and very usefull to take with you anything you want .
Bag	POS	4	we love this to keep we jumper in and easy to find , and store in the truck .
Bag	NEG	1	I have hardly use this little puppy . I nick the belt very slightly sand a piece of aluminum , replace the belt and it will not track properly or adjust now . I 'll update this when I have call Bosch , but I have have other problem recently with a 1375a grinder , and Bosch be not very helpful . overall this should be a great sander accord to design and spec , but it seem so delicate as to be entirely unsuitable for anything other than a ornament . for now , I be not buy another Bosch tool and I be create lot of colorful language when I think about the company . Make sure you read the poor review about Bosch before you commit you hard earn dollar to this company , I do not think they be a very honest company with much integrity at this point .
Bag	POS	5	still go strong after 6 year . have take a beating , but still in good shape . Bosch be quality .
Bag	POS	5	good Quality , good price . the tool bag be very spacious and well build .
Bag	POS	5	almost buy the variable speed but less powerful cousin . glad I do not . this unit work great . it be heavy so you will not want to do much vertical or overhead work . one reviewr comment that it wear out he worker and I can see why . a hour be the must I can go without a break . but you can get a lot of sand do in a hr with this tool . much quieter than my old Sears unit . dust collector work surprisingly well -lrb- but I wish they offer a vac attachment becasue at the rate this unit remove material you will have to empty bag every 10 min or sooner . probably 3 time faster than my 3 '' Sears and more stable with 4 '' footprint . my past tool have be Bosch , Milwaukee , and Dewalt . but I buy Makita 's top of line 18v saw and drill and be very impressed . buy this base on that experience and great review . very satisfy .
Bag	POS	5	I be refinish the woodwork in my home . I order this to save time in sand the jam , casing and baseboard . this sander work like a charm . I be very glad I purchase it .
Bag	POS	4	Perfect size for 20 ' 4ga . cable . keep they coil and compact for storage behind seat or in trunk .
Bag	POS	5	finally find a bag that will fit my 20 ft water hose , along with a 30 foot flat hose for my rv , as well as a 3ft hose . no kid it all fit . it will also hold various tool in a divide compartment that I need when I hook up to a water source . I be also order another to hold my 50 amp rv electrical cable . it will hold that along with a 30 to a 15 amp adapter and a 20 ft. length of 15 amp extension cord . all of the hose and electrical cord need to be neatly roll up , of course , but I be already do that anyway .
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this bag to accompany my Sony Digital 8 trv-103 . it fit great - not too tight , just enough room inside for a tape or two if need . the side pouch be a little tight , but have enough room for the remote control , two tape and a spare battery , plus a av cable . my only critique be that the bag do not have enough space for the ac adapter . while it fit in the main compartment with the camera , it be a pain to juggle it around when removing\/replacing the camera . nice leather-esque outside and rig bottom . a good bet for a small camcorder .
Bag	POS	5	very well design and manufacture machine . balance be near perfect , and use with one hand be comfortable and always in control . compare to a similar design sander , make by AEG , this sander be much more comfortable and better balanced . if you be a serious woodworker , this belt sander will spoil you . once you use this sander , you will not want to use a sander with a different design again .
Bag	POS	5	I have now purchase 2 box of these bag . they do not rip and be very sturdy . I have a large dog and these bag work great .
Bag	POS	4	the dust bag on my sander be not the same as the one depict in the image on the site . the one that come in the box be cheesier in design , and lack the bracket\/strut show . also , the suggest accessory be limit to sandpaper roll . no dust collection attachment , no upgrade for the bag . the sander itself be powerful , easy to use , and do the job I want it to do .
Bag	POS	5	I own the Kodak dc3400 digital camera , and can not say enough about this case . it have room for my battery charger , extra set of battery , all pc cable , Kodak 's software cd , and the manual that come with my camera .  if you digital camera be similar in size to Kodak 's dc3400 , get this bag . it be simply the best balance , between compact size - and have enough room for all you accessory .
Bag	NEG	1	ok , I find out that this do not fit my detector -lrb- ace 250 -rrb- , which I would have know if I have read the other review . that would not have matter if ... the thing be well make . I assume that since it be make by Garrett that it would be well make , but the zipper stick on first go and then break 5 minute after get it out of the package . that say , I be return it and will not bother replace it . this be one accessory that you could probably save money by not get in the first place . I be surprised Garrett would let they name be on this thing it be such poor quality . point to Garrett for at least be responsive about the quality issue of this bag , but they should definitely redesign it so it fit they detector and do not break . after all , it do have the Garrett name on it !
Bag	POS	5	purchase this for my son to keep in he truck under the seat . it arrive quickly and look just like the picture . very happy !
Bag	POS	5	we have several of the Bucket Boss bag and they be all very handy ! if you want to store a tow strap and\/or jumper cable , flashlight , glove , small tool , reflectors\/flares , etc. then the Cable and Tool bag be perfect . it have room for more stuff than the Bucket Boss Jumper Cable and Extension cord bag . we have that one too and it be more basic , but still really nice for jumper cable and glove . any of the Bucket Boss bag we have get have be very sturdy and have hold up well despite slide around in we vehicle , be toss in the garage , and stuff under car seat .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for my husband as a Christmas present . after he would use it for over a month , I ask he what he think of it . he love be able to throw everything into one bag -lrb- he be a carpenter -rrb- . it be durable , roomy , plenty of pocket . the one drawback , he say , be that if he fill it with as much stuff as it would hold , it be too heavy to carry around the job site ! -lrb- e.g. , when he be do commercial work , there be a ton of walk compare to when he be do residential . -rrb- so that be about the one thing that could improve this bag - put it on wheel with a telescoping handle -lrb- like a suitcase -rrb- . : - -rrb-
Bag	NEU	3	the bag itself be great . the problem be that it be feature as be compatable with the JVC GRAXM225U Camcorder . well ... it be not ! it be too small . there be not enough room to hold the camera , the charger , the VHS cartridge , rca cable and a spare tape . it would be great for those who only want it to hold the camera and the VHS tape cartridge . but then where be you go to keep the rest of you `` stuff '' !
Bag	POS	5	I own a Kodak DC215 Zoom Digital Camera . it fit very nicely into the Kodak essential Camera Bag . I buy the bag online , and when I receive it , it be bigger than I expect . the small compartment for extra memory card be very handy , but the strap for hold battery be pretty tight , so fasten the battery be kind of a problem . however , this keep the battery from fall out . there be a small flap inside to separate the camera from cable or other element that you might want to place inside . tightly squeeze , I be able to fit in my camera , a Kodak Battery Charger , and a SanDisk usb card Reader . all in all , this Camera Bag be very roomy , nicely build , and with enough space to fit what you need to carry around , if you own a small camera , like the dc215 .
Bag	POS	4	the product be exactly as discribed , but i realize my hop vac fit there too -lrb- nice job Bosch -rrb- . so I have never use the bag . if you do not have a standard shop vac , well worth the money to help keep thing clean .
Bag	NEU	3	the bag be well make and fit my k-x with 18-55mm zoom nicely . inside top flap pocket for extra battery and sd card be nice to have . only problem -- the strap be too short to wear over the opposite shoulder . I be not huge , but when I put the strap over my opposite shoulder the bag come up to my rib . the strap need to be at least 10 '' longer to sit at waist\/hip level . hang the strap over the same shoulder be not nearly as secure . this strap use ` male ' side release connector on each end , most camera bag use clip-type fitting so I have not be able to find a replacement strap .
Bag	POS	5	Works great and construct well . my jumper cable coil up inside nicely and be no longer a tangled mess on the floor of my truck . it fit behind the seat next to my Bucket Boss Tool Roll -lrb- another problem solver -rrb- where I keep my tool set .
Bag	POS	5	I get tire of deal with my old skill 18 '' sander . I could never keep more than half the belt on its track . the bottom plate would also collapse on one side after awhile necessitate a screw driver pry job . with the right belt the Makita be a well behave mini-beast -lrb- loose the belt that come with the Makita and get yourself some of the premium Norton belt ... you 'll be glad you do -rrb- . as other 's have say , this thing track flawlessley after a couple of adjust turn on the side-dial . the belt stay on track even after change through various belt . the bottom plate assembly look durable . it have plenty of power and it suck up saw dust to the bag like a vacuum . I would venture to say it capture about 90 % of the saw dust . the long cord be great because it keep you knot-tie connection to you extention cord away from you project where it typically get hang up on corner . this thing be make I look for project I would not have even consider with my old sander .
Bag	POS	5	I would see these at the local dog park and have be look for they locally for some time . all I could find around town be those really thin bag that just do not quite get the job do . I be happy to find these available at Amazon where the price be good and shipping be free and fast . these bag be way better than most other in term of pick up you dog 's business and in odor control . they be a lot thicker and much easier to tie up . a quality product that be a must for dog owner .

Bag	POS	4	this be a pretty decent product . more room than I expect , but the shoulder strap really need to go . there be absolutely nothing special about it . it could use some sort of padding on it too . the bag fit my Canon EOS ix Lite 2 lens , a flash , the owner 's manual , 5 roll of film , and I have still get room .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this camera bag for a larger digital camera . while there be plenty of room for my camera and all of its accessory , the bag be not overly large or awkward . the bag be sturdy and its compartment be laid-out logically .
Bag	NEG	2	purchase the Garrett Metal Detector bag a few day ago . very disappoint with the bag . my Garrett ace 250 metal detector be 44 '' long on the shortest lenght . the bag be only 42 '' long . the metal detector be too long for the bag . guess it would fit if I be to take it apart but ... that seem silly & useless . would not have purchase the bag if I would have know it would not fit unless I take the metal detector apart . what a rip off ! Update ... I would like to say that the company stand behind it be product . they email a response on my review and be very concerned that I be disappoint with the bag . the company make thing right and in this day and time that very seldom happen . most of the time it be all about sell the product . but not this company . it be important to they that the customer be satisfy . I must say , I be satisfied now .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this last week and get it a few day ago . this be a great digital camera bag . I do extensive research before commit and I must say it pay off . the bag have a nice divider which I use to seperate my cable from my camera . it also be line with a soft fabric so you lcd screen be not scratch . I must say that if you stuff the main compartman , the front compartment be basially render useless . the front area have two laminated compartment for smartmedium or compactflash card . they be basically the only two thing that will fit since the camera in the main compartment make it a very tight fit .
Bag	POS	4	receive this bag to go along with my Olympus c-4000 . it be quite a nice bag , relatively compact and easily fit my c-4000 with plenty of protection offereed by the wall of the case and padded divider . there be plenty of room leave for cable , a flash or even another camera if you have get one . a mesh pouch on the inside of the main compartment flap offer a handy place to store my sm card . on the other side , another component offer 4 elastic loop for battery , and 2 mesh pouch -lrb- 1 zippered -rrb- for store more battery or whatever else you might have . I can easily store 3 set of 4 aa battery in here , with plenty of room for more sm card . and to top it all off , a zippered side pouch for another place to put stuff -lrb- nothing too thick though -rrb- . there be a adjustable carry strap that you can use to sling over you shoulder , plus handle on the top and side , so there be plenty of way to grab onto the bag . the only think I do not like about this bag be that mine do not seem to want to stand up . it always end up roll over onto its back . this however be a pretty minor thing .
Bag	POS	5	I be a Aircraft Line Mechanic and have be for 15 year . this little bag be a replacement for the first . they last year and be of much higher quality of anything you 'll find at Sears , Home Depot , etc. . plus the price aint bad .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this case to carry my Olympus 2020 . the newer Olympus 3030 and 3000 should fit nicely too . I debate buy a smaller bag which would fit the camera only , but the extra room have come in handy . I have a compact pair of binoculars and these fit snugly along with the camera in the main compartment .  in the zip down front I store the manual , the remote , a extra memory card and a cable to connect to a tv . at family event it be great to see the picture on tv right away .  the case be well make , but it be not genuine leather , although it be hard to tell the difference . you can put you belt through the slot on the back , but it be somewhat bulky to carry this way . I prefer to use the shoulder strap . all in all a excellent product .  edit on 11\/10\/02 : Case Logic have change the design of this bag without change the model number . I own the older horizontal version , not the bag picture which have more of a vertical shape . Case Logic should have use a new model number when they update the bag .

Bag	POS	5	this morning I receive the messenger bag and it do really come up with most of my expectation . I could not help myself to get on this web site and review this product right now , after make some test of course : - -rrb- First of all , about the soutside : the design be really great , clear and elegant , the Amazon.com logo discreet -lrb- it doesnt make you a living advertisement sign for the company -rrb- . the bag be roomy and there be place for plenty of stuff , e.g. several book , magazine , personal item ... the material be of good quality and you wont have to worry about you stuff in the rain ... I would have wish though that the material be a bit thicker and sturdier , similar to the messenger bag of the Freitag brother ... the different pocket inside -lrb- especially the one for my Palm V or any other pda -rrb- help you to get organize a bit easier . the clip with the key ring be a nice add-on , but you do not have to push very hard to get the key away , so I be not sure if it will be that safe , a little pressure and they be go ... I do like the protected compartment for the notebook . it be in a safe place , away from the other item you might carry . a quite good feature be also the little pocket with zipper on the back flap , allow you to stow the magazine you just buy in the bag without have to open the front flap ... this be very handy if you be too late and have to run to catch the train or bus : - -rrb- the mobile phone pocket be neat , but slightly too small for my Noka 7110 . I can squeeze it in , but can not really close the flap . another quite nice add-on be the mesh pocket on the outside for a can of a beverage or a small snack . it doesnt get in touch with you document and other item . this be very handy in case you crash once with you bike : - -rrb- the foam padded shoulder strap be great ... if the bag be heavy , it be still confortable to carry and it holdp perfectly well on you shoulder . other small thing to mention , especially for biker , be the removable reflective tape a the webbing loop to attach a lead in the night . this bag be so far the best bag a biker can wish for .
Bag	NEG	2	look like a good product , but be clearly use and the belt be worn so I return it . Amazon will not let you exchange this product , so I order another . if it be use as well , I 'll be dissapoint . so far I have order 3 powertool on Amazon and all have be clearly use , and some missing part . I be give they one last shot . beware .
Movies_TV	POS	5	in my view this be the single best season of Dr. who . I know that be say a lot - and I know a lot of people would disagree with I . it be pointless to say all the story in Series 2 be great - because virtually all Dr. who episode from all the season be great . I think , more than anything else , it be the character of Rose Tyler that put this season over the top . she be great in Series 1 ; but she be almost sublime in Series 2 . plus , this season contain the single most poignant story in the entire Dr. who repetoire . though I agree with Colin Baker , who reportedly say that `` the empty child '' -lrb- from Series 1 -rrb- be just about the best Dr. who episode ; to I `` the Girl in the fireplace '' from Series 2 be the most poignant . it be far from the best Dr. who ; the alien menace be almost comical in the way that some of the alien from the earliest Dr. who episode be ; and the story line do seem stretch a bit . but there be something so almost magical about the episode , and so unexpectedly sad about the end . you get the feeling that if Dr. who could have choose a true soul-mate from among all the woman he have ever encounter , it would have be this `` Girl in the fireplace . '' and the two-part episode `` the Satan pit '' show the depth of the bond between the doctor and Rose more succinctly than any other episode ; he be willing to place he life entirely in she hand - that be how much he be come to trust she instinct for do the right thing . then the season finale , another two-part episode , bring they relationship full circle . it , too , be one of the most poignant Doctor who episode - and one of the most innovative , pit two of the Doctor 's greatest enemy against themselves as well as against the world . all in all , this season be nearly perfect .
Movies_TV	POS	4	this be one of the best movie Disney have ever make . the reason I give it four star be because the woman be make as the enemy in this film . but as a child that do not matter . you child will love dream that neverland really exsist . I highly reccommend buy this movie for you child .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	my kid love this movie and I highly recommend it . where I find fault be with the dvd itself and the Disney Corporation . twice now , when insert into a computer it have completely screw thing up . first , on my laptop for which a system restore be able to fix and the cause be blame on the anti-piracy software that automatically run . the second time , when my daughter insert the disk into my neighbor desktop computer and the Geek Squad after many hour end up have to ` wipe the hard drive ' and re-install everything . again , the cause be blame on ` anti-piracy protection ' . so , the movie be great ... just be cautious before you watch it on a computer .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this be the second set of Dr who Series two that I order -lrb- after return the first due to a bad dvd -rrb- and there be a bad dvd in this set as well . will return and order a third set .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I have not previously watch or even be interested in a straight-to-dvd Disney sequel , but for some reason I pick this up , and think it sound quite cool , kinda have a back to the future ring to it . I put it back , think it would just be as bad as the review for other ` classic ' would be , but my mum remembered , and buy it for my birthday . -lrb- early twenty and I still love Disney movie ! -rrb- I be pleasantly surprised , as with most straight to dvd sequel , they be normally a carbon copy of the first , and in no way original . it feature many of the same familiar character , include the two mouse , my favorite ! albeit with different voice . it be a original storyline too , with change everything that happen in the very first , and make Cinderella fight for she prince charming . -lrb- do he ever get a name by the way ? -rrb- I do find the song be not as great as the original , but we would have guess that . they be not really memorable , but I can definitely remember the one from the first . just one wee quibble - do anyone else notice when the prince propose to anastacium , she actually put the ring on the wrong hand ?! it be suppose to be the fourth finger -lrb- if you count the thumb -rrb- of the left hand , not the right ! unlike many sequel , this will probably stand the test of time , and will definitely be one I show my kid , along with the other special edition I be collect - although by that time , dvd will probably be obsolete . but if you have hear bad review about other sequel , this be the one you should pick up . and adult will enjoy the suspenseful storyline too , even if it be predictable .

I see this movie at the cinema and it rock . the action and on the edge of you seat story line be both the best I have see yet -lrb- except for the Matrix , of course -rrb- . I have see this movie 3 time already and would see it a fourth . I highly recommend this movie and I be really look forward to see it on dvd .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Will Smith be a lawyer who get mix up into some trouble when some old college buddy of he run into Will at some woman 's underwear shop with out Will 's knowledge he slip a videotape in Will 's bag that tap have the murder of a congress man . people who want that tape be National Security Agents they be the one 's who cause that murder and they want the evidence to clear so they chase after Will . this movie have some great acting , adverturous , drama , action , and it be not boring just because it be not a sci-fi special affect . it be a dissapointment cause they be no box office hit to it what a rip off .
Movies_TV	POS	5	First Will Smith rock all-round . the movie really make you think about the lack of privacy in we world today . and make you wonder about the government and what role they play or do not play in we society . it be well write and act out . full of drama and suspense . scary , in a way because you do not know how far someone will go to get what they want . a must see , and worth every penny you spend .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I think that this movie be a great Jerry Bruckheimer production . I like how most of the stunt be pull off in the entire movie . Will Smith should be congradulate for be in this great movie from Jerry Bruckheimer . -lrb- who also do `` the Rock '' and `` Armageddon '' -rrb- Gene Hackman 's part as Brill be very interesting , as well with Jon voight . in total , this movie should be a must see and a must buy movie to own and watch .

Movies_TV	POS	4	I usually do not like sequel , but Disney step it up a notch with this one . it be full of suspense , and engage the entire family . this princess movie , be great for both gender , because it not only have the basic princess\/true love theme , but it also have a more active role for the Prince , the mouse , and the Grand Duke . I recommend this movie for a cute afternoon flick .
Movies_TV	POS	5	IM FROM BALTIMORE , MD. . and to watch will SMITH PLAY in MY HOME TOWN make worth BEEING FROM here . . the movie be INTRESTING and FUNNY . great as ALWAYS will . I love U
Movies_TV	POS	5	I love this movie , as I do all the earlier Disney animation . I read the review by Carolinapooh , and I , too , remember that the part about clap to keep Tinkerbell alive be in the movie ! if you watch it , you will see Tinkerbell fading , and then there be a abrupt cut and suddenly she be ok . why would they have take it out ? maybe they think kid today be just too sophisticated for that , and sadly , they may be right .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I know alot of people hate the `` sequel '' Disney movie simply because they feel they creation `` desecrate '' the memory of the original . ah but do remember , these be never `` original '' Disney property to begin with , they be softer retelling of fairy tale or other classic novel . Cinderella III be a entertaining movie . it be animation be quite fluid , with a few mistake here and there , it be still a bright , vibrant movie with consistent character design . the storyline be a `` alternative '' storyboard , where the character be force back in time and down different path for the sake of the storyboard . this make thing interesting , and even the comedic bit be either slapstick , or subtle intelligent and amusing . the bottom line be that this be one of the best thing Disney have release in recent year ... they non-pixar cg movie have be terrible -lrb- `` Chicken Little '' almost unwatchable it be so bad -rrb- and not much else have come from the studio . anyone that love fairy tale , Cinderella , alternate timeline -lrb- a popular device in Sci Fi and fantasy -rrb- etc will enjoy this movie . my daughter be three and this be by far she favorite film right now -lrb- yes , even over `` classic '' like `` Cinderella one '' as she call it , etc -rrb- .
Movies_TV	POS	5	the second Seasons be great , the music , the story , and well the Girl in the Fireplace be a masterpiece !!! I hope the 10th doctor never regenerate !!!
Movies_TV	POS	5	this sequal be wonderful . the animation be excellent , though other may comment that it be not correct to the original style . I hate to be the one to point this out , but we be no longer in the 50 's decade . animation have come a long way since then , so of course it will look sharper . from a artist 's standpoint , there be such subtly and depth to each scene that , storyline aside , it be delightful to watch - especially character reaction . as for the story , it be clean -lrb- which be a rarety in and of itself -rrb- as well as entertaining . the plot take a fun twist on what would happen if the wand be in another 's hand and really try to prove that even without magical assistance , Cinderella could still hold she own . and be not that what the 50 's version be attempt to point out as well ? I do not think this movie detract from the original , but instead be a fun , relax form of entertainment . however , to be fair , the only part I find irritating be the change in the mouse 's diction . that be the only change that I find annoying enough to mention . that aside , it be nice to see a woman fight for she dream and get they - and a prince with a personality to boot ! so I would recommend this movie to those who just want a clean , fun , and intelligent source of entertainment for themselves as well as they child .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I find enemy of the State a well-written , well-acted movie . my family constantly discuss the casting , the plot , and the `` could this happen in we ` real ' life '' situation . this video stimulate we discussion about the influence of technology and government and the impact of technology in the hand of governmental department . it be a timely viewing consider the privacy bill that be now be discuss in Congress . this be a recommend video to watch with older child -lrb- 16 or older -rrb- .
Movies_TV	POS	5	it have a great actor like Will Smith , if any one be suspicious of the goverment this will just add fuel to the fire .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I love blu ray ever since I buy and you cant get any better picture or thrill in any other system like the blu ray . I fully recommend this movie for a action thriller .

Movies_TV	POS	5	wonderful dvd . I receive the dvd within a week and and kid love it - perfect for Christmas - thank you !
Movies_TV	POS	5	definately one of the best spy movie I have see in a long time . from the murder at the start to the resturant scene at the end this be a great modern day spy story . whether you take the gadget seriousely or not be up to you , remember , it be just a movie . my only complaint be that Will Smith be way out of he league in this one , he just can not hold it in a serious movie . Hackman who do not appear until almost half way thru the movie steal the show and show what a class act he be . will smith should stick to the goofy part he have play before like MIB or wild wild west , not the serious movie the scenery and tech stuff be all well do and one worth owning , so buy this one
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be a great buy for I ! ive be look everywhere for Peter Pan but its in the Disney Vault ... not easy to explain to a 4 yr old !! it be a little pricey but well worth the money at the end of the day ! the seller be great ! she ship promptly and it arrive in the condition she say it be in . totally unopened ! Great buy for I !
Movies_TV	POS	5	it be Peter Pan ... it be a classic ! of course it be great !
Movies_TV	POS	4	I love fairy tale in all form , and I really do like Cinderella II . I be a bit worried about Cinderella III because my first impression be that Disney be just out to make more money . as I learn the premise for the movie , `` what if the fairy godmother have become incapacitated and the stepmother have the wand ? '' and it make I stop and say , `` okay , I have to see that movie . '' Disney develop the plot quite nicely . Everytime Cinderella triumph , the stepmother would one up she and I would still be wait for my happy ending . I like the anticipation . also , as many other reader have say , Cinderella have gut in this movie . she stand up to the stepmother and tell she `` hey lady quit rain on my parade ! '' this movie be a great sequel . it seem to stem from a provacative idea rather than Disney be out to disappoint we with a sub-par sequel -lrb- i.e. . the jungle book 2 -rrb- . Watch Cinderella III , it be a great movie for a rainy afternoon with you kid .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be watch over and over again by the girl ! it be fun for Grandma 's to watch with they also , as we remember the first Cinderella movie , do not we ?

Movies_TV	POS	4	my husband could barely contain himself when he find out that he much beloved Dr. who be come back to town on the sci-fus channel back in 2005 . I have to admit that I be a bit excited myself . here be a chance to get reaquaint with the a little british sci-fus export about this painfully british look guy -lrb- Tom Baker , of course -rrb- with this forever long scarf lope about among cheap `` hi-tech '' set with this much younger british chick . I have only see a couple of episode as a very young child and find that it merely creep I out -lrb- I believe it be Robots of Death -rrb- , but I remember enough to relate when people mention the show , or when I would hear the theme music . so , here I be at 33 years-old ready to wipe the Dr. who slate clean and begin thing all anew for my husband 's enjoyment , if anything . the new series have be alot of fun . hear the theme music again , even to a non-fan be nostalgic enough to bring tear to the eye . the effect and studio set look great , the story exciting and clever . both doctor have be fun loving and just chock-full of all thing a sci-fi fan could possibly want , and prove once again that one do not have to be a `` kill em all and let God sort em out '' kind of hero to save the day in Whoville . so , I give this series a nice , healthy rating . room for it to shoot for perfection , not that it have far to go . that be say ... after watch `` School Reunion '' with Elizabeth Sladen reprise she role as Sarah Jane Smith with faithful computer dog k-9 , it make I wonder about the whole Dr. who phenomenon in general . my husband fill I in on the fact that this show have be on for 26 consecutive year from 1963-1989 and that there have be more doctor before and after scarf dude . so , out of curiosity , I start dabble into classic Dr. who mostly from the 70 's be that this period more coinside with the little I remember about the show , and the fact that more dvd be available from this era . since then I have see the light . true , the effect and set be still pretty poor , and the creature costume rather embarrassing , the script a bit forced , but it do accomplish one very important aspect of Dr. who . it last out 26 year through the blood , sweat , and tear of those man and woman in front and behind the camera . there be no computer artist to type in a program to bring all those monster closer to life . many script be write up in a week 's time or less . the film be fast and furious , often require the actor to get it right the first time , because studio time be a precious and expensive commodity . all this to fill up a half hour every Saturday for British kid , and somehow , it still become a worldwide obsession . okay , enough of the soap-box talk and on to personal opinion of these new doctor . now , mind you , I like these guy , just as I mention before , and if these be the absolute first to play the role , it would be a no-brainer to say that they be dead-on . but they be not the absolute first and in some way there be a lot to be desire . they do a great job take on bit and piece of the doctor they generate from , but I find Eccleston 's heavy northern accent rather jolting . he remind I of drax from the Armaggedan factor episode from 1978 with that accent , and I would rather not be remind of Drax manifest in any doctor regeneration ! and as for little David Tennant , well , I refer to he as a little , oily rat in another review , but only because I have only see he in he role in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and he do such a great job as a little , oily rat man -lrb- other than wormtail , of course -rrb- ! he be also rather too young look to play this 900 year-old Timelord . at he age he have to be careful not to come off a some arrogant , know-it-all brat . and as for companion Rose and all she baggage -lrb- I mean ` family ' -rrb- , I do not recall Tom Baker 's doctor ever care whether he have a companion or not . he most certainly never beg they to come along , they be sort of always dump on he to haul around . these be personal opinion , of course , and if northern british accent and kid look timelord be you cup of tea , hey , this new series be perfection already . but if you can not help but long for the bohemian dress , scarf wearin ' , alien charm of Tom Baker lope about those cheap , build from scratch set , ad-libbing Oscar Wilde style in he smooth baratone voice , then slap 4 star on this series and remember to be eternally grateful that it bring you back to try and true , bare knuckle who .

Movies_TV	NEU	3	it be SAD that DISNEY have become the MULTIZILLION DOLLAR INSTITUTION that it have . if it be still under the WATCHFUL CARING EYES of WALT DISNEY HIMSELF , I do not THINK the dvd version of THIS movie I just purchase WOULD be the same . the movie of COURSE be as great as it always was - a wonder of ARTISTRY & FANTASY SEAMLESSLY blend together . the color be as beautiful as ever . the SOUND be O.K. , BUT I would THINK that DISNEY COULD DO SOMETHING in the way of restoration as far as the HISS that be very noticeable - especially in the louder passage .  i ALSO AM no DUMMY when it come to GENERAL dvd knowledge , but I be totally confused look at the back of the dvd case as to WHETHER THIS MOVIE WAS A WIDESCREEN VERSION or FULL SCREEN . it clearly state in miniscule letter under the run time that PETER PAN be PRESENTED in ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL ASPECT RATIO , APPROX . 1.33:1 . I -lrb- and probably anyone else besides ROGER EBERT -rrb- WOULD GUESS that this mean it appear as it be originally show in THEATRES - WIDESCREEN ! I be more than tick to find LATER that it be in fact a pan and scan version , and after pay not a SMALL SUM of MONEY , I feel a little rooked .  my suggestion be to keep watch that WORN OUT VHS COPY UNTIL DISNEY decide to invest a little more in one of their crown achievement . oh and do not WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT that LIMITED ISSUE NONSENSE MEANING that THEY ONLY MANUFACTURE EACH MOVIE TITLE ON A LIMITED NUMBER RUN ONLY once per generation -lrb- with DISNEY , GENERATIONS be BORN QUITE OFTEN -rrb- . right now , THEY OBVIOUSLY be have a gigantic case of TIGHTWADITIS and YET be still pricing THEIR TITLES WELL above OTHER studio . sad , sad , sad !  i ONLY HOPE WE all can see this movie in ITS FULL WIDESCREEN GLORY and SOUND SOON ! PETER PAN in ITSELF be still magical !

David Tennant be the best thing to come to DOCTOR who in a long time . he be more believable than he predecessor , and he portrayal of we favorite Time Lord be the best I have see in quite some time . Series 2 have preserve the spirit of classic dw while take a bold step into the future -lrb- no pun intend -rrb- , and story arc like ` rise of the Cybermen ' \/ ` age of Steel ' and the season finale will not disappoint . ` the idiot 's Lantern ' could have be from season 24-26 . ` School Reunion ' and ` Tooth and Claw ' be also excellent . simply put , there be not one single story I do not like . my highest recommendation , need to be 10 star !
Movies_TV	POS	4	I think this movie -lrb- enemy of the state -rrb- be one of the most deep - level tech movie ever make . full of action and techniephobia . this movie also go on to show how technology be great , but can also be use against the normal citizen , be u in afghnistan or zanzibar . in this thriller the power of the NSA be unleasehed . this be one of the mpost powerful agaency in the world and they can use technology to track down the most tortoise-like movement of the citizen of the world , government or any other group see as a menace . powerful sophisticated gadget and the sateleite be use . will smith as a lawyer just step on to something he should have never step on to , and so he be chase and haunt . every aspect of he life be monitor . blackmail , torture , snoop , life digression , phone bugging , mind torture , private life all be use against this innocenet surbarban man by the corrupt official of the NSA who want to bend force of gravity at they will . they fail in the last minute . and like all reality the good guy win , and so evil be conquer , and will smith with thehelp of he friend -lrb- a former guerilla train NSA official brill -lrb- gene hackman -rrb- be instittute at he rightful place .
Movies_TV	POS	5	after the astounding climax to the first season , I find it hard to believe that this strong debut would ever be top . the Christmas special blow those doubt apart , as well as set the tone -lrb- and some plotpoint -rrb- for the rest of the season . this episode be one of the most unusual in the show 's history , as the doctor be incommunicado for almost three-quarter of its run time . the payoff be huge , with the best debut of a doctor that I have ever see . there be so many great moment in those fifteen minute . see the doctor work out who he be . the swordfight . six word . Russell T. Davies really stamp he mark on the series with this episode . the succeed episode all , arguably , vary in quality depend on how high you standard be . the most annoying aspect be the inclusion of Torchwood - which on reflection be not as subtle as the ` bad Wolf ' meme from last season . for I , the standout be the perfect three episode run - tooth and claw -lrb- Russell T. Davies -rrb- , School Reunion -lrb- Toby Whithouse -rrb- and the absolutely superb and near-perfect Girl in the fireplace -lrb- from the brilliant Steven Moffat -rrb- . all , for I , perfect Doctor who episode and also great example of the different tone and theme that the series have explore throughout its long history . New series fan may be perturb that Rose get less to do this season . it be clear , in retrospect , that the focus be on create story for the new doctor . while Rose 's backstory run as a subplot in the background . in retrospect this be understandable , but be rather jarring on initial transmission . especially as Russell 's plan for this season be not entirely clear from the first few episode . the dvd extra be as great as ever . in addition to the Confidential Cut-Downs , there be also the dvd commentary . Dissapointingly , Steven Moffat do not get a turn this time round , although he do provide commentary in a podcast freely available on the BBC 's Dr who website . however Russell T. Davies do commentate on Tooth and Claw , and be wonderfully entertaining and informative . it be also incredibly please to see the new doctor - David Tennant - make a big contribution to the dvd as well . he contribute commentary to three episode -lrb- School Reunion , Idiots Lantern , Doomsday -rrb- . and also provide a whopping 85-minute video diary that cover the entire season . it be a suprisingly frank documentary , show David 's initial nervousness at both live up to the Legacy he so clearly idolise , and cope with the hectic schedule that seem to be the hallmark of this new series . big kudos to Tennant for provide such a generous look at what it take to be the very best in this fantastic series . in addition to be one of the best doctor 's ever , he be also a great Ambassador for the show . look back on it , the second series be much much better than the already strong first season . whether or not you enjoy it depend on whether or not you accept David Tennant as the doctor . and whether you can accept that this new series flatly refuse to conform to fan expectation of what a science fiction should be . this be Doctor who as big-budget Family Entertainment . in my case , the answer be a resounding yes . this second series have help in lay a strong foundation for what be undoubtedly the greatest run this much-loved series have ever have . if I could , I would give this 10 star out of 5 . more please !
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have love this movie ever since I see it on the Disneyland tv show in the early 1950 's . it absolutely enthral I . the masterful animation , the fascinating story and the uplifting music go a long way in make the delicious fantasy almost seem true . as in all good , juicy story , character give each other a rough time . Captain Hook stalk Peter Pan and even give he a deadly bomb ! Peter Pan also taunt the good captain . the crocodile also do he best to make Captain Hook 's life a misery . funny how the pc police never bring up these male-on-male confrontation . but once Tinkerbell get jealous of wendy , or the mermaid act uppity , then we be deal with female-on-female bullying , and that do not go over with the lady nowadays . never mind that it be a fact of life . as for the caricatured native american stereotype , that be all they be . unhappily , a lot of caricature be exaggerated image which have grow up around a kernel of truth . and they apply to all race . as a white male , my biggest nightmare be that I may someday actually look like Homer Simpson , Elmer Fudd or Popeye . but I 'll just have to take my chance . kid be very sensitive to the energy around they , and if you sit there watch Disney 's Peter Pan with they in a guard , pc resistance-stance , they 'll tune right into it and then get turn off . why not lighten up , and take this film on its own wonderful fantasy term ? that positive energy will enhance the experience for you little one . if ever a film be make for child , this be one of the best .

Movies_TV	NEU	3	I have be make a point of re-watching all the Disney classic from my youth and comment on they with adult eye . it be be a very interesting experience , and PETER PAN be no exception .  what stand out be all the element Disney would not dare put in a animated film today ... like the carefree knife play and the pirate who Captian Hook pick off with he hand gun . but by and large , the whole fire engine red face `` injun '' scene be pretty amazing . prune-faced and hook-nosed , the red man hit every stereotype in the book ... and it just go on and on .  while we be all familiar with the story of PETER PAN , I have no recollection the whole thing be essentially motivate by jealous female . Tinkerbell be jealous of wendy . the mermaid be jealous of wendy . wendy be jealous of Tigerlily . jealous Tinkerbell sell Peter out -lrb- at least Tigerlily be smart enough to keep she mouth shut -rrb- . all be vie for Peter 's attention , and he be near oblivious to the lot of it .  and Peter , in my opinion , be kind of a unlikable jerk -lrb- along with the retard lose boy -rrb- . a wise-guy , who pout and listen to no one , he turn on he best friend , Tinkerbell , and banish she forever , make the effort to reconcile only when he think she be about to die . at one point , I be kind of hope Captian Hook would at least get one good shot in .  it be a all right piece of animation , better than SNOW WHITE and far better than ALICE in WONDERLAND ... but not nearly as good as JUNGLE BOOK , which be by far my Disney favorite . PETER PAN land somewhere between SNOW WHITE and ROBIN HOOD on my scale . with the most enjoyable part involve the hungry crocodile or wendy 's littlest brother -lrb- who be really cute -rrb- .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I have my heart set on loathing David Tenant as the new doctor after Christopher Eccleston 's departure in the final episode of the previous series . there be just no way that he could replace Eccleston ! no way ! I be prove wrong a thousand time over . Tennant become more and more of a pleasure throughout Series 2 and then 3 and 4 . the team , Billie Piper as Rose and Tennant as the Doctor , in this second series be a incredible , unstoppable combination . do the special effect get better or do I finally learn to look past they and see the rich depth the show offer in spite of they ?
Movies_TV	NEG	2	a simple question . all write should really be critique by modern script editor and writer , even producer , by five basic question - who ? where ? what ? how ? why ? sadly these very basic question be not bring into play when show like this be make . much of modern television writing be very sad , but the effort tend to survive via hungry , lethargic audience in need of escapism that find delight in sexual content , glossy effect , and kitschy but vapid symbolism\/content . all story base entertainment have to have strong story to be excellent , and this be really , really , really awful scripting . that be say , I do want to say that Tennant be probably the best doctor since Tom Baker , and if he can refine the character a little and cut out some of the hectoring speech and slobber he might be the television character of the decade . the production value of the new series -lrb- aside from write -rrb- be brilliant ! but many of the actor can not shine because the scripting be so limited and flabby to center on glitz rather then character - a shame since so many british actor be brilliant at make greater then life , enigmatic and memorable performance when give good script and direction . Davies seem to have a penchant for the hilarity that be put the ` doctor ' in HOSPITALS . har har , such a great joke , especially to kick off a new doctor . 90 % of the season deteriorate into logicless monster and motive . awful denouement tend to involve the Davies signature machina-ex-due with a super magic wand sonic screwdriver . cop out galore ! and if that isn ; t enough , you get a surprise oral sex gag for the kiddie , and a slew of black tie party , east ender , and sappy sexual situation that take the place of the base instinct of survival and greed that make the series able to continue through the decade . if write reflect a writer , then the writer -lrb- s -rrb- basically portray that they be all about sex , party , hook up , sappy sentimentality , and random political struggle within corporation . nice . the shine star of this season , stand head , shoulder , chest , abdomen , groin and thigh above the surround effort in ` Girl in the fireplace ' write by Steven Moffat -lrb- creator\/writer of the brilliant coupling sitcom -rrb- . while this be a story of twisted survival it be also about emotional love and devotion ; a unusual Doctor who aspect unexplored until now , especially swamp in lust the rest of the season . the doctor become a enigmatic and valiant ` prince ' that unexpectedly -lrb- but extremely well write -rrb- create devotion in a unusual ` princess ' . but then the logic of the story go to hell in the denouement as it become another silly ` doctor rant at lethal enemy that stand there and take it on the chin while stand still as a statue ' moment common in this season . that be vindicate by the final twist reveal the motive of the story . the `` New Adventures of Doctor who : EastEnders lose in space '' be a grab bag . if you be a kid who need a new shiny with some lust and casual love throw in - it be perfect . if you be a intelligent viewer who want great story , perhaps something to reaffirm life 's glory and myriad wonder ... walk on by , or sob like a little girl over the money waste on ephemeral garbage . personally i find this season , and almost all new who story , rather intellectually insulting and simplistic . if only the crew ask - why ? - from the start . they would have find they do it for the money and fame , and just write show about money and fame . and we would have at least have story that honestly express they soul , rather then a combo of fan pandering image and situation string together with screech , simplistic dialogue .

Movies_TV	POS	5	this movie I believe be something most of we only wish could have be make . who do not want to see Cinderella maybe lose she happily ever after ? in the first movie she always seem to do she work with a sarcastic tone . she could not even get up out of bed , some maid !! I think this movie might be a little scary for some kid because the stepmother be really wicked this time . she break Cinderella 's slipper and then tell she to go `` clean it up '' . the best part be when the step mother use magic to trap Cinderella inside a pumpkin , and not that fancy coach this be inside with he seed and thorn grow all around it and Cinderella 's dress be all rip . Haha and Cinderella be so silly when she go `` but I dance with the prince '' and the stepmother just laugh at she ! also what really be amazing be that there be almost a unspoken theme in the movie the the King and Anastasia fall in love , if you have see this movie you know what I be talk about !! could this be a clue to a possible Cinderella 4 ?? Anastasia as Queen lol you decide !!
Movies_TV	POS	4	like many other thousand of people I be a huge fan of Disney animated classic so I be very happy that this edition of Peter Pan be available . I always have a very active imagination as a kid and it kind of dwindle away as the year roll on by so it be always enjoyable to watch this movie and think of never grow up . the story be so fun and magical . now a little down side to this movie be I do not want my kid to try to fly out a window !!! do you think Michael Jackson be try to have the face of Peter Pan it really do look like he with the large eye and very small nose ?
Movies_TV	NEG	1	\*\*\* spoilder \*\*\* below warning . it start off with cinderellum 's foot which do not look the same as in the original movie , kind of disgust in my opinion . when she talk about herself , blah blah , it be just not cinderellish , she be full of herself !!!!!!!!!! Prince do not look the same , he neck be too fat and it seem he skin tone change it almost every scene . they speech be too `` modern '' and annoying , do not give it a authentic feel at all . the step sister be WAY TOO GOOFY , unrealistic , I mean they can hardly walk two step without flop over , too silly . Anastasia be way too stupid and she be apologize for every little thing she do , it just do not make any sense , in the first movie they be all equally rude , even as child they be selfish little brat and now she just look like a big goof ! the step mother be always mean but here the part when she get the wand be go overboard , it be like she be a villian or witch ... too much drama in that part `` call on all the force of the universe ??! '' duh . Anastasia 's foot be HUGE , and then she kiss it and jump around the room , this be go overboard , a girl in that era would not act this way at ALLLLLLL !! Cinderella 's comment after she step mother leave be just weird , and then that uncatchy song and run out into the field . very uncreative and dramatic , these tune be all so similar in all the disney movie today and so annoying !! at the palace : how on earth do she get to the palace before the rest arrive ??? the prince work out with he father in the `` pink '' gym and you would think he be a circus boy after perfome those high rise stunt , never would have expect that from he . the part when prince charming have to apologize to they sound so cheap , he enter the room and it be like he do not notice the girl ISN `` t cinderellum . . and how anastasium introduce herself as a jerkess then it turn into a bit of a circus after he propose . the whole `` spell thing '' be just like in the little mermaide . if you look closely she put the ring on the left hand then admire it and it be on she right hand . Cinderella finally find the prince : it be like she be make a fool of herself , she little giggle and she sound EXACTLY like the princess May from Mulan , terrible . the head maid drag cinderellum away look so degrading , the whole `` meeting '' be cheesy . now when the step mother and sister be show into the room with the large cake this scene be a absoloutely rediculous !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what a mess when the king meet the bride-to-be who be in a aweful disgusting state . unbelievable ! now Anastasia and the prince practice dancing , why on earth do she have to wear she `` one '' glass slipper ??? the step mother seem to have so much influence in the palance once she `` move in '' when the king give the queen shell to anastasia he sound like a old indian chief or something , the voice just do not seem to fit the part . `` I dooooooooo '' practice by anastasium be TOO MUCH , and I wonder why she have such a nice singing voice , do not seem to go together , plus suddenly she can dance so gracefully . . remember the first movie when the two sister practice singing '' sing sweet nightangale '' they sound AWEFUL so what bring such a change ? so unrealistic . Cinderella struggle to say the magic word once she have the wand in she hand , stupid !!! Prince 's reaction after hear the true story from the mouse be a little calm , you would think he would have a bit of a more worried reaction and not take it so lightly . . he be a cross between Eric from little mermaid and zoro rid off on the horse . now cinderellum be tell to get on the shop , she shoe and foot while step up onto the ship look really fat and ugly . . totally aweful animation . on the ship she look like Jane Wendy 's daughter from peterpan . she bang be all fray and she look like 13 year old . now the prince ride off behind the ship and once he jump onto the ship he be look a lot like a Zoro , even he skin tone be darker if you compare it to when they show the dream of he and cinderellum dancing at the ball . also what with the hand palm thingy , look like something from TARZAN !! Notice cinderellum 's fray bang and hair , once she hug and swing around with the prince she hair start to turn back into perfect form . now thing calm down a bit and you think its go to end ... hold on to you seat , it be not over yet ! Cinderella be rest near the king once prince bring she back to the palance , notice in the first scene she have she hair nice and out , then when the servent come to tell the king that they be not able to find the step mother and sister cinderella now have she hair tie back with a blue ribbon , then in the following scene she hair be back to be out without a ribbon , STUPID , pay attention to detail disney , HELLO . what be with bride prepare themselves ? this scene remind I of mulan get ready for she wedding with mushu on top of the closet , really strange . the pumpkin just have to be include in the movie somehow , honestly I find this scene where cinderellum get stuck inside quite scary and gross . ok she make she escape and if you pause the scene right when she be on the horse look at the castle in the distance notice she foot , it be huge ! even she hand look huge . Disney , DETAILS ! Cinderella savagly rid all the way to the palace while the wedding be ongoing , the priest look like something from star war , freaky . - ok , cinderellum appear , break up the ceremony , step mother be shout at anastasium and once she start use the magic it be like prince just step in there use he sword to divert the magic away from cinderellum , it look so lame and he facial expression be not heroic or anything . note cinderellum 's hairdo , it be tie up high in a bun , however when she be prepare for the wedding it be low behind she neck , kind of strange . I do not like the fairy 's voice in the end , it sound so squeaky . now after the credit and the little `` photo '' which show some really goofy one once you reach the last one with the heart frame rose and cinderellum and the prince in the middle notice they hand , I think they go just a bit too far with this !!!

Disney , it provide some really amazing information on the film I never know before . other commentator include Walt Disney himself -lrb- piece together from old interview , etc. -rrb- , some of he Nine Old Men , other vetran animator , Kathryn Beaumont -lrb- who provide Wendy 's voice in the feature -rrb- , and of course note film critic Lenoard Multin , among other . next , take a few minute to examine the vast visiual gallery . wonderful stuff in there for fan and casuial viewer alike .  the bonus aim at kid be worth a look too . the best by far be the `` follow the Leader '' sing-along , although it look a bit dull -lrb- not be take from the newly restore version of the film , but a older one -rrb- , and the Pirate Treasure Hunt game be fun , if too easy . the dvd storybook be AWFUL , though , attempt to create a new story out of the animation that be already create for the original movie . if that sound confusing , do not worry , do not bother with the feature . another note : why could not they have put a `` you can fly '' sing along on the disc as well ? there be a Sing along videotape devote to that one as the title tune , so a version do exsist . I ` dve much prefer it over `` follow the Leader , '' but really would have like both . oh well .  lastly , there be a new trailer for `` return to never land '' -lrb- not either of the theatrical one ; this one have some really great new footage -rrb- that be worth a look before you go see the movie . and if you buy this before March 31 , you child will get in free -- as a extra bonus , there be one free child 's admission movie ticket for `` return '' inside every special Edition dvd and video .  in addition to all this , new trailer show that among other `` Beauty and the beast '' and `` the many adventure of Winnie the Pooh '' will make it to dvd this year -lrb- finally -rrb- in October for the former and May for the latter . great news , I think . plus there be a really cute Disney tv spot call `` Magic happen '' on the second menu of trailer .  all in all , this be a wonderful dvd -- much better then the limited issue edition -- and I be glad to own it . something you should not miss ! \*\*\*\*\* -lrb- 5\/5 -rrb-

Movies_TV	POS	5	this be one film which use modern technology in one of the most useful way . the main draw of the film other than the excellent , all-star cast -lrb- will Smith , Gene Hackman , Jon Voight , Gabriel Byrne . . -rrb- be the clever use of editing and camera technology to draw suspense and awe to a viewer . Smith 's paranoid performance be the best of he career -lrb- hate he in id4 and mib -rrb- and Gene Hackman -lrb- good guy finally -rrb- basically reprise he character from the conversation in he best performance of all he seemingly endless action-thriller . I think this be Jerry Bruckheimer 's best film yet . . intelligent , witty , suspenseful , well-acted , well-directed , polished .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I love the cast in this film . Hackman and Smith have do some really excellent work . while I generally enjoy this film for what it be , it could have be much more . I be somehow remind of `` Conspiracy Theory '' in that it be a disappointment consider the possibility it offer . mostly , the problem be in the basic premise of the story . any one of thousand of conflict could have be play out , but instead , we see a personal crime in Voigt 's character take out on a unsuspecting citizen . this may sound minor , but we could have see a glimpse of some big-brother massacre , and the minor hero who overcome it . some of what be offer here make you wonder -lrb- in worried fascination -rrb- what be possible , but generally I can say this be not a must-see movie . if you see Conspiracy Theory , do not bother with this one . I give it 3 star in case you do not catch Conspiracy Theory , otherwise , 2 star .
Movies_TV	POS	4	this be a movie about a fake mission go bad . . all of the rouble in this movie be a test , for some secret government agency which put Will Smith and he friend & family at risk . . this movie have action and great high tech gadget ...
Movies_TV	POS	5	I guess I be extremely spoil by season 1 -lrb- see my review there -rrb- , wait all those year to find that once the show have return , it be back with a spine tingling , take you breath away with excitement , jump out of you seat in disbelief of such glorious script and performance , absolute freak vengeance . now , onto series 2 , I be in no doubt look and expect nearly the same , albeit with a different actor at the helm . this be nothing different for who fan , and with some slim exception , it all work out well . I know some of you say we can not compare this and series one , or this and that , but hey , it be what who fan have be do throughout time . I firmly believe that as a entire season , last season series 1 of the new show rank up there as possibly the best full run of episode in who be full run . have to follow that would be a true test indeed , and while I think season 2 be very enjoyable , it be not quite as strong as 1 . there be evidence even in the promising first episode , the Christmas Invasion , that there be some little je ne sais quoi that I could not quite put a finger on , that make be ever so slightly down a notch from the high impact of season 1 's show . there be further evidence when it come to season 2 's first real episode , New Earth , as it muddle along without a whole lot of excitement to take in . thankfully , after the very good reunion of the doctor , Sarah Jane , & K9 , the show seem to keep creep up and up in excitement quality , until the brilliant season finale two parter . in fact , this two part mind blow season finish , be probably the first time I have feel as ecstatic as I do watch the entire first series episode . I be displeased that the second season never feel as unique as series 1 , but nonetheless still have fun watch yet another strong run of episode in who be continue history . after think about it more and more , I come to the realization that it be less David Tennant vs. Eccleston that make the two series different , and more about the strong writing of series 1 compare to the medoicre script of season 2 . season 1 just have more snappy dialogue for the doctor , more impactful event tightly weave into the 50 minute episode , and overall better story . that be not to say this season do not have it be share of goody , include one of my favorite , idiot 's Lantern , deal with supernatural event in the 1950 's , and lead into the very spooky two parter , the impossible planet , and the Satan pit . it be just I could not help but think when I watch season 1 , that this be hand down the best show on tv , the best sci-fus episode on tv , and the best who in a long time . with season 2 , I can not safely say that I enjoy it better than say a season of the dead Zone , Stargate , or Stargate Atlantis , but I can say it be a very enjoyable piece of sci fi and another superb addition to the who Universe . I just wish the script be tighter and flow better . on to David Tennant . it take I a few episode , for I to take a liking to he , but quickly find that he be just as quirky a doc as any predecessor and deserve he worthy place among the rest . he can bring he serious side out just as quickly and believable as he distinct , flamboyant one . I think have he a second season will be a welcome event , after have Eccleston for one short one . hopefully , they will get the write a little more up to snuff , and the excitement level , so I can once again , safely say there be nothing better on tv than who . for right now , I can not , but it be still a excellent season of who , a smooth transition into a new doctor , and leave at a point where this new , yet old , franchise can continue to grow . here 's look toward season 3 ...

Movies_TV	NEU	3	do I miss something in watch this version ? I seem to recall that when Tinker Bell 's light be fading the audience be ask to repeat that `` I believe in fairy '' or something to that effect . however , in this version , that portion have be edit out . Peter locate Tinker Bell as she light be fading and we know she be seriously injured and then it simply cut to the pirate ship and then Peter and Tinker show up just fine with no explanation of how she survive . what give ? political correctness of a anti-belief in fairy type ?

Movies_TV	NEG	1	Pretty decent movie , fast pace , keep you interest . however , this be not a widescreen anamorphic dvd . instead , it be a inferior , old-tech letterboxed edition . in other word , you can still see it correctly in you widescreen tv , but with a magnify setting ; therefore , you lose vertical resolution . do not buy this inferior-quality product .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Peter Pan be one of the Ultimate Disney classic . the restoration make it even more enjoyable this time around . this be the perfect keepsake ... my child will love grow up watch this !
Movies_TV	NEG	2	I miss the day of Disney classic with good storytelling and good theme . unfortunately , Disney have not tell a good animated story since Tarzan . Pixar do it well , but Disney insist on recycle they old classic in the way of straight to dvd movie . Cinderella III be just another sophomoric recycling of a Disney classic . the plot be unbelievable and silly -lrb- how could the Fairy Godmother be so careless ? -rrb- , the character sound like every other animated character , the song be generic Broadway and all sound the same , and why do the stepsister have such beautiful singing voice ? in the original Cinderella , they could not carry a tune to save they life . do they tone-deafness all of a sudden disappear ? if you have child , this may amuse they , although this no where near capture the spirit of the original . the quality of this be no greater than a Saturday morning cartoon .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	my 4 year old daughter love anything princess and therefore love this movie with its `` happily ever after '' end . as a adult , I be disappoint . since I have never see the second movie I do not know if the sister Anastasia change , but she be different in this movie . how do someone so spoil and mean become the character she be in iii ? also , the king be no longer interested in grandchild , but true love , which be not part of he character in the original . I guess what I be say be that the character do not seem to line up with the original character . I will say there be some redeeming thing about this movie ; namely that Cinderella be more independent and resourceful here .
Movies_TV	POS	4	do not expect much from a Will Smith movie for some reason , always think of he as a bit of a lightweight , so maybe that be why I be amaze at how good , tight , exciting , and disturb this movie turn out to be , and Will 's performance be superb .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I find it to be charming , and the `` twist '' in the story , while not original , quite please to the overall story and make Cinderella III more connect to the first Disney 's Cinderella than be the second film .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have love the story of Cinderella since I be a child . I do not see Cinderella 2 , but when `` Cinderella 3 - a twist in Time '' come out I buy it . I watch it with my four year old granddaughter and we both enjoy the story . Cinderella 's stepmother get the Fairy god mother 's magic wand after Anastasia steal it , and go back in time . the animation be very good and the story be delightful . my granddaughter love it and we have watch it many time . most sequel do not live up to the original , this one come very close and do not disappoint . Great Disney movie for the entire family .

Movies_TV	POS	5	in response to two other reviewer here , the `` if you believe in fairy clap you hand '' scene be in many other version of `` Peter Pan , '' include the various widely-seen tv production , but it be never in the Disney cartoon . those who think it be be mix up they memory .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	a very long and boring movie to say the least . it be way too confusing and have enough story for 3 movie . it get too frantic sometimes and the end be all mess and keep I way too confused . not enough explain . good act though -lrb- which be what save it -rrb- but there be way to much empty space in between .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this workout do offer some cardio benefit . it also do introduce you to some basic Bhangra step . it be not a serious workout or dance video . I would not buy it just `` to mix up my workout '' .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I watch Cinderlla 3 last night . there be a lot of hype surround the film , but I think it be pretty good . the first Cinderella - the timeless classic - attract audience of all age . as we already know , the story be perfect and have the ultimate culmination : '' ... but I have the other slipper ... '' the second Cinderella be just three mini-story weave together to make a hour and a half movie . the story be best suit for child under age 9 . -lrb- these be the kind of featurette that would appear on a Saturday morning cartoon series , for example - the plot be simple , the dialogue be pretty cheesy , and nothing be really accomplish at the end . -rrb- Cinderella 3 obviously do not compare to the classic first , but in all truth , it be a legitimate film that will extract all the emotion you have pull from the first film . on that topic , however , the level of `` emotion pull '' have change , probably in a attempt to keep the movie viable in today 's market . for one , the wicked step-mother be now about ten time more wicked . the first movie play she as a cold antagonist with a more slithery approach to she wickedness . in Cinderella 3 , that same step-mom now conduct open act of evil -lrb- and only a few slithery action -rrb- . why be that important ? because a overwhelmingly evil step-mother dwarf the emotion of feeling sorry for Cinderella . in the classic film , one could not help but feel so terrible for poor Cinderella as she work so hard and be not reward . now , Cinderella be punish for be nice . this change the whole concept of the `` Cinderella Story . '' now you just want that old haggard step-mom to get drug from the back of a horse-drawn pumpkin carriage - you could care less if Cinderella win the prince back or live happily ever after . that be , the irony that be bind to happen -lrb- good defeat evil in a Disney film -rrb- be not as spectacularly fantastic as the classic film when Cinderella produce the second , miss slipper . the irony of Cinderella 3 be that the step-mom merely get she comeuppance . but this movie also play on the personality and feeling of Anastasia , which I generally find kind of weird . it separate she from drizzellum which to I be awkward . I appreciate the dueling sister who only act in concert to harm Cinderella 's interest . now the movie pull out the possible good in one of the three main antagonist . Cinderella 2 explore this the most , however , but I think it be brutally do . basically , Anastasia be a `` good trapped inside '' dumb-dumb , as one would be leave to think . Anastasia basically want thing but do not know how to get they , but somehow manage in the end , usually from revelation or help from Cinderella . sure , that make Cinderella seem even more like the saint that she be for help she sister -lrb- who apparently still hate Cinderella , even when she help -rrb- . but it draw so much focus away from we one true star : the lady who go from rag to riches and define a brand new storyline for other to coin or imitate . to give Cinderella 3 a side credit , albeit minor , be that it `` follow the rule . '' namely , the rule regard `` bippity boppity boo , '' magic , and the animal and they interaction . the talk mouse , the effect of the magic on the animal , and the history of each character -lrb- include whatever may have be grotesquely alter in Cinderella 2 with lucifer fall in love , Anastasia desire and find love , or Cinderella be conflict with she new title in royalty -rrb- make amends for Cinderella 2 's near-fatal depiction . that be a hard challenge , but these Disney movie-maker get it right in Cinderella 3 . to close , Cinderella 3 be best suit for child age 12 or under per my review . it will not reach out to the heart of ad ult like the original classic do , and it will not draw the emotion you would expect from the classic Cinderella Story that Disney found back in the day . due to its simple storyline and re-focus of character ' significance and portrayal in the film , I can only recommend this film if you child actually like -lrb- or be entertain by -rrb- Cinderella 2 , or if he\/she really still love the character since his\/her last viewing of the original Cinderella . do not expect much from Cinderella 3 -lrb- especially its replay value -rrb- so that when you do watch it , you will not be disappoint when you compare it to the monumental classic .

Movies_TV	NEG	1	this movie should be toss out , just as `` song of the South '' be . I be not sure what to say when my daughter ask why the native American be call himself the `` red man . '' in addition , Tinkerbell be portray as a sexualized , vindictive , jealous female stereotype from another era . we may have to throw this one away .
Movies_TV	POS	5	when you hear the name `` Will Smith '' you think comedy . well in this film he prove he be much much more . probably the highest pay black actor and with very good reason . with extreme talent he play he role in the film very nicely . Jean Hackman be also brilliant . get the film !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I absolutely love these dumbbell . the ease of use be incredible and the ability to change small increment in weight and not have weight all over the place be great . right now I be do some circuit type training that require you to move from one exercise to another with a very short break , these make it easy . I can finish a exercise , change both these from one weight to another and get they in position for the next exercise in under a minute , easily . I have have no problem at all with the quality and use . you do need to make sure the pin be fully seat and both side be under the same weight as many have state but it be no extra effort , just pay attention and make sure the pin come all the way through when you push it in . they be easier to change on a hard surface , if you use a carpeted floor it help to lift one side to change the pin . only negative I can come up with , these do not expand into a heavier set so you may grow out of this set . so think that through carefully as you may save $ $ in the long run by buy the next set up to begin with .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have have a pair of the 1090 dumbbell -lrb- 90 lb each -rrb- for about 10 month and be lift they from the floor until now . the price finally drop here on Amazon so I decide to pull the trigger . Trust I , if you be above 30 like I , and can not recuperate as quickly as a 18 y.o. . . purchase these ... you 'll save you back . these be sturdy , well-made and convenient stand for you selecttech dumbbell . the shipping carton say 45 lb -lrb- the outer-box be marked Bowflex stand ... so if get as a gift , have it gift-wrapped -rrb- . unlike other reviewer , I have absolutely no problem set this up ... the instruction be straightforward ... they be the ` exploding-diagram ' type ... so maybe I be visual like that . I recommend not take all the washer , nut and bolt out of the packaging ... just slice the shrink-wrap to keep the bolt in they position ... that way it be easy to differentiate . it come with a allen-wrench , but you 'll need a 9\/16 socket for the nut-side ... I recommend hand-tightening until it be fully set-up ... just to make sure everything be align . the caster work fine ... move it around a couple of time and no problem ... but they do seem cheap compare to the rest of the stand . if they break , I 'll just use the peg . all in all , it be well worth it to get the stand ... I just have to save up long enough after I get the dumbbell themselves .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I use this dumbbell for bicep curl . very nice and sturdy . on Amazon it be go for $ 30 i think ... here be the bottom line . shipping be almost as much as the product . its pretty much a rip off . I buy the from a store near my house that I work at and I pay $ 25 before any employee discount . now that $ 5 before shipping . good dumbbell but not worth 60 buck
Dumbbell	POS	5	this item be from the same company I buy my plate holder from . I be a lot more pleased with this rack than the plate tree -lrb- not that there be much wrong with the tree , it be just a little on the light side as far as the gauge of steel use . -rrb- this thing be build tough , and be large enough to accommodate plenty of dumbbell . I have a few different brand of dumbbell , and have no problem with they fitting this rack . like the plate tree , assembly for this be really easy . there be more piece for this than the plate tree , so it take a little longer , but it be still basic . Everything go together with large nut and bolt . the rubber foot both protect the surface of the floor , and prevent the rack from move around . this item , combine with the plate tree , really sharpen up the look of my home gym . everything be nice and neat and have its place . bottom line be I be pleased with this item , and would recommend it . oh yes , it be also ship in a timely manner .
Dumbbell	NEG	2	this shakeweight do not work at all . 6 minute a day , no way ! if you be look for a workout , do not waste you money on this !
Dumbbell	POS	5	when I see these weight on the internet , I be really turn off by the `` square '' shape . I try to find they in local store to see if they be really that ugly in person , but could not find any . however , just as I be set to purchase from a different manufacturer which offer a traditional barbell look , one review on the PowerBlock change my mind . it be a review by a woman state that the PowerBlock 's handle grip be very comfortable for a woman 's hand , whereas as the handle on the other set I be consider buy be fatter in the middle , make it harder for smaller hand to get a good grip . anyway , go with the PowerBlocks in spite of the square shape and be totally in love with they now . they fit my hand perfectly and take up less space than the two pair of dumbbell that I have be use previously -lrb- a 3lb . set and a 5 lb . set -rrb- . and it be really , really easy to switch the amount of weight with the pin setup , which be very similar to the way you change weight on a weight machine at the gym . I would definitely recommend these ...
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be just what my husband need ! no more bend over to heft the weight up off of the floor . the stand be easy to put together , unlike some of the review I have read prior to purchase . I 'll have to guess that bowflex hear enough bad review of the instruction to re-write they . that be say , my husband simply look at the diagram and do not read any of the instruction , anyway . he be not a super handy man , so this be say a lot . he love it , I love that he be safer . two thumb up !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	so , I think this shake on it be own -lrb- well , with the help of battery -rrb- but it do not . I read the review and see other people who say the same thing but I think , maybe they just do not figure out how to turn it on . I be wrong . obviously we be not the only people to think it shake on it be own because the people of Shake Weight have they own website explain how to make it shake ... call ` howtoshakeit.com ' so , if you do not believe I -lrb- or think I just do not know how to turn it on -rrb- go to that website . it seem like the weight and the shake part of it probably do help with you muscle and everything but it also seem like , if you hold a regular weight very loosely -lrb- allow it to slide between you hand -rrb- and shake it like you would the shake weight , that probably work about as well . they suggest you do it for 6 minute a day -lrb- which sound easy -rrb- but for beginner , that be nearly impossible , as the weight really do work you muscle . if you buy the weight new , it come with a short video with a 6 minute workout and if you watch it , you see that the lady who do the video do not even seem like she can do the whole 6 minute straight , as the lesson do not seem to be one continuous shot but clip paste together to make a complete 6 minute video -lrb- if that make sense -rrb- . if you have get the money to spend for a ` special ' dumbbell , then go ahead and buy this . but if you be think it be go to be some kind of miracle worker , I do not think it be . I highly recommend you try shake a regular dumbbell first and see if that help you muscle because , like I say , that be basically what this do . I be a little disappointed .
Dumbbell	POS	5	why spend a couple hundred buck for a dumbbell rack that do not do anything but hold you dumbbell ? for less than a hundred buck this item be great . it be quick and easy to set up , I have all the piece that it be suppose to have and it do exactly as it be suppose to -lrb- sit in the corner of my garage and hold weight -rrb- . what more can I ask for ?
Dumbbell	POS	4	I have be use this product twice a day for 2 week and I have to say , it seem to be work well for I so far . yes it do make a noise but personally , do not bother I at all . if you be look to create definition in you arm , I do not this this be the product for you . if you just want to slim you arm down , this should work well . it be difficult to use at first but once you get the hang of it , you will start to feel it work right away . I have already notice a difference in my arm and so have my husband . I be give it 4 star because of the difficulty of first figure out how to work it correctly . other then that I be love it . it be like any work out equipment . the result reflect the effort you put in .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I do this everyday and must tell you at first thought I would give it try . do not like what my arm be look like . after 3 week I see result . I keep the dvd in the player and do it every morning . you think at first it be not really do to much but the last of set on the dvd I feel the burn . love it !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I wish I have pay more attention to everyone else 's review because I be really surprise when I open the box and there be only one dumbbell ! I would not recommend buy this - go buy a pair together instead !
Dumbbell	POS	4	I use this product for a little more than half a year before I decide to stop . I truly do feel the burn from the workout , but there be just too many con and I have no significant result even though I use the product for such a long time with workout that last even longer than the 6 minute they recommend . pro : 1 -rrb- the exercise on the dvd be very easy to follow and it include a timer to indicate when to stop . 2 -rrb- you will most likely get sore after the first several day , indicate that you muscle be in fact be work -lrb- not necessarily get result -rrb- . 3 -rrb- the dumbbell have groove on both end to facilitate you handle for the shoulder exercise -lrb- see # 5 in con for handle for triceps and biceps -rrb- . 4 -rrb- no battery ! I think most people assume the shake function be electrical . 5 -rrb- if you buy this directly from the manufacturer , you get a 100 % money-back guarantee , include the shipping and handle cost to send it back . they refund the purchase price of the weight almost immediately . con : 1 -rrb- the dvd be certainly not a $ 15 value . the dvd contain only 3 exercise limit to 3 upper muscle : triceps , biceps , and shoulder all within 6 minute . 2 -rrb- for 6 minute a day , I find the workout to be too easy . I be average-build and I have to work at least 15 minute before I start to get tired . 3 -rrb- the dumbbell itself be very noisy , especially if you be try to get a more intense workout by shake the weight more vigorously . you can even hear the noise when you be watch the exercise on the dvd . additionally , I would often be interrupted several time to keep the noise down from the weight . 4 -rrb- towards the end of you workout , the dumbbell will start to slip out of you hand because the palm of you hand start to sweat . as a result , I have to stop my workout a couple of time to readjust the weight . 5 -rrb- exercise during the triceps and bicep exercise be very awkward . you have to wrap one hand around the middle of the weight during these exercise , but it be difficult to hold on to the middle while you be shake . therefore , the weight be design more for shoulder exercise . 6 -rrb- I be sorry to say this , but I definitely look ridiculous when use this product . you would not believe how many people have laugh at I . therefore , you can only use this product if you be by yourself . 7 -rrb- in term of the money-back guarantee if purchase it from the manufacturer , you have to personally make the initiative to contact they and have they refund you for the shipping . unlike the refund for the product , they have still yet to refund I for shipping and handling .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this be a great product - quality and value be superb . just a bit `` bulky '' , but better than have 200 dumbbell in you home . the only `` imperfection '' be that you have to be careful not to hit yourself in the face with the corner . I do not hit , but you do have to be mindful when you do maneuver around you head .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I read a few review about build this say it be tough , so I be wonder what I be get myself into . the instruction be a breeze , there be 3 different long screw , and as long as you place they next to each other , you can tell the size difference . it take I about 15 to 30 minute to build this with a 9\/16 '' ratchet wrench and the allen key they supply . Make sure you have that wrench or a adjustable though . its pretty sturdy , I opt not to put the wheel on as I will not be move it at all . it alleviate tension off of you lower back and make it easier to place the 1090 dumbbell in there holder without mis-alligning of damage they . definitely recommend if you buy the 552 's or the 1090 's . I have see it online on Amazon between $ 129.99 and $ 148.99 . I purchase it at $ 139.99 because I could not wait any longer .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	let 's get something clear right away -- the Shake Weight do NOT come close to replace weight-lifting or other more intense resistance exercise . those that do light calisthenics or nothing at all will be please with the Shake Weight . it give a quick `` pump '' to you arm and provide some `` toning '' to the muscle in a very short period of time . the benefit be short-lived and very limited . even do the Shake Weight routine several time a day will not produce much muscle gain . you would be much better off do a weight resistance program that break down muscle tissue and repair it larger and stronger over time . if you be sedentary and want to do a very basic , easy exercise that take little time , the Shake Weight might be right for you . just be aware of its limitation and be realistic about the result you 'll get .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this product look good with a charcoal hammer enamel finish . it assemble easily with no issue . its very sturdy and because the rack be slant front to back , its easy to access the weight . I like the three rack because it fit a full complement of dumbell with some room leave over for extra plate for a bench press . as a example , I have hexagonal dumbell , and my weight set-up be as follow : 5-8-10-15 lb pair on the top rack ; 20-25-30 lb pair on the middle rack ; and 35 lb on the lower rack along with my extra 5lb and 10 lb plate -lrb- which I make a simple holder for -rrb- .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I really like these weight . you do have to press the handle down to change the weight on carpet , but I 'll take that over have multiple set of weight that take up 5x the space any day . I have not have problem with the pins\/magnets that other have mention and I have be use they for several week .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very sturdy rack . hold up my dumbbell set with ease . Grey gloss finish bring out the professional gym look . it be a bonus that it be 3-tier . Higly recommend it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this be now week six for I . I can not believe my eye . I use it everyday . I can only do one minute behind my head for my triceps because it burn so much . I have increase from one minute to three minute in front for my biceps . I try this because $ 15 be nothing after ready that many people love it . I think if you be a gym rat , this be not for you , however , many woman have really poor arm strength and this be a wonderful start . my arm be tone and the fat be disappear . I have lose one inch on each arm because I measure it before I start use it . once this become too easy , I plan on buy the man 's Shake Weight .
Dumbbell	POS	4	excite to receive the Shake weight that my husband order . I like it . Easy to use and very portable , I can take it anywhere . I like the fact that I can just pick it up while watch tv and not even notice it .
Dumbbell	POS	4	the PowerBlock dumbbell set be great for someone like I who live in a apartment and have limit space . I get a full range of motion and the pin stay in place very securely so I never worry about have the weight above my head . sometimes the weight get stick when lower they into the unused plate , but if you keep it straight when you lower it there be no problem . I think the carpet allow they to move so I may get the tray or get some kind of hard surface to keep they from tilt . otherwise a great product that perform perfectly ! recommend :  PowerBlock Personal Set Tray
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I just buy one of these to go along with my dumbell and I have to say the instruction be some of the worst I have ever see . nice idea , but trouble out of the box !
Dumbbell	NEU	3	that paint you see on the number ? do not get too attach to it . for a more comfortable grip try wrap the handle in pipe insulation with ducktape . also make sure you have floor mat . these be usually a better deal than the rubber coated one .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the shake weight be the best complement to any one workout equipment ! when use properley it do exactly what the trainer say it do ! 5 star ! WooHoo
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy 2 of they . I do not have any problem . they be cute , and work for I . I like they .
Dumbbell	POS	4	ok , so , I have own this product for about 6 week now , and I have be use it on a regular basis . I `` do '' try to work out a few time per week anyway , but , I do not always have that luxury -lrb- due to hectic work schedule -rrb- . anyway , after use the Shake Weight for maybe 3 week , I have start to notice small improvement in the toning of my arm , bicep strength , and overall arm strength . I have no tie to this product , but , I have to say , I really like use it ! I keep use it because it seriously break the monotony in my old -lrb- and boring -rrb- work-out routine , -lrb- which be very important for build muscle -rrb- . I notice that I be use muscle that I do not normally use , from dumbbell & weight alone ... and I must admit , it be fun to use , and you will feel you arm burning after just a few short minute of use this product -lrb- also , a good thing -rrb- . and , YES , there be some `` science '' behind this product . be it the `` be all end all '' of workout ? no ! you still have to eat right , try to live a healthy lifestyle , etc etc. ... but , it be a well construct product , that be fun to use , and `` so far '' seem to be work like they claim . I be usually pretty skeptical when I see something on a tv commercial regard fitness , but , have be into fitness & martial art -lrb- on & off -rrb- for year , I know the science be base on Isometric Contraction , and resistance . it be a proven science and it do work . I do similar excersize when I train in martial art year ago ... only we do not have this type of product back then . yes , there be plenty of negative comment out there -lrb- regard this item -rrb- , but , do not knock it until you have try it . I really think it be kinda weird at first , but , when you start use it , and notice a difference in a reasonable amount of time , you 'll keep use it , which be also very important . my only complaint with the `` Men 's '' version of the Shake Weight , be that it be only 5 lb . would have be a bit better if it be 7 or maybe 8lb ... but , that be just I . maybe they 'll make another model down the road ??? that be my story , and I be stick to it . : -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	I really enjoy this thing ! grant , this exercise could be do without the shake weight , but it be fun to have a prop to help with the shakin ' . be careful though to get use to the weight , and ease you muscle into it before diving into the dvd routine . ; -rrb-
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I be really look forward to the shake weight ... even though my husband make fun of I for buy it . I guess I be lazy in believe that this be actually power rather than I do the work of shake it . I be not sure yet whether I be go to keep it , mainly because it be a bit cumbersome to hold and my wrist feel sore after shake it .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this be item be awesome will highly recommend purchase the bowflex selecttech 552 dumbbell with the stand . the stand be the key component you do not have to bend to pick up the weight its located at the proper height , make it very convenient to do you rep and ease to change the weight . the downside be that the weight do slip sometime would recommend jingle the dumbbell before remove from cradle to insure the proper weight be lock to the dumbbell and not fall on you foot or toe -lrb- that would hurt pretty bad -rrb- . one other thing the stand be miss label so double check with diagram before tighten nut and bolt of the initial stand .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	we buy a pair of the 8 lb weight . in we workout room , we set the weight on a ledge that be paint . we have two other set of neoprene weight that we buy from target a couple year back and have no problem do this . these weight stick to the paint and pull it right off the ledge . so we put a mat under they . next ... they stick to the wall when they get too close . luckily we have more paint to touch everything up .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I just buy the Shake Weight at Wal-Mart for -lrb- ... -rrb- in they as see on tv section to try it out . so far 9 out of 10 as see on tv item that I have buy have a be a joke . -lrb- Shoes under be the only one I keep and even then I almost do not because it be so flimsy . -rrb- I like to try out the product to see if it work and because it be Wal-Mart I have no problem return it . I do not know how I be go to do that with the Shake Weight because as far as I can see there be no way to test to see if it actually work . how long do it take to make my arm look better ? -lrb- I think this be why there be virtually no review as yet , people can not tell if it be work and they get tire of it before it be obvious that it be or be not work . -rrb- but here 's what I have get so far : `` Feel the burn '' : it be true that you biceps do start to `` burn '' while you be use this product but I think that be from have they unnaturally clench for 6 minute straight while you shake yourself to death . -lrb- yes , this be how the product work , you bicep muscle clench up and stay that way while you be do this exercise . -rrb- I be always teach to do `` rep '' during strength training which allow the muscle to tense and rest every few seconds while you work it use resistance -lrb- i.e weight -rrb- . `` it be a weight '' : no , not really . it have a little bit of weight to it but there do not seem to be any resistance to this tool and it seem that 6 minute of continuously have you tensed muscle shake would just hurt you -lrb- hence the `` burn . '' -rrb- not to mention that even if the product do work there be no way to add more weight to it and you muscle would quickly outgrow it . then it be obsolete . `` shake '' : when do shake fat to shrink it come back in style ? remember those old contraption fat man in sweat shirt would be strap into and it would shake they belly in the hope that it would make they smaller ? there be a reason you do not see those anymore . they do not work and they be dangerous . `` Dynamic Inertia '' : go ahead , Google it . you will not find it anywhere on the web unless it be in connection to the shake weight . when do a product get to coin new physics terminology ? and exactly what do it mean ? `` it look silly and kinda pervert '' : the product do not claim this but almost everyone else do . the product do look like a elegant massage toy and face it , you do look and feel silly shake you arm fat everywhere . -lrb- hey , if you do not have arm fat then you would not be use it . -rrb- and pervert , well , there be even a spoof video on YouTube that be so r-rated that I refuse to discuss it further here . other review on the web : there be like 4 and I think they be all write by the people who make -lrb- or sell -rrb- the product . they have almost nothing negative to say about the Shake weight and one woman even claim it make she boob bigger . yeah right . and finally , the price : -lrb- this be maybe the only good thing about this item . -rrb- it seem as if the manufacturer can not agree on how much this thing should cost . they infomercial list it at a bargain at 19.99 plus shipping and handling -lrb- which I think be like another 7 or 8 buck -rrb- and Wal-Mart have it simply for the -lrb- ... -rrb- . so what be up with they sell it on Amazon for almost double the price ? well , it turn out that the the manufacturer be not the one sell the item . jwwbooks4 be the company sell it through Amazon and I guess they be hope to make a big profit . it be a little shady in my opinion . final Verdict : I guess I be go to see if actually work . hey , I have get 90 day through Wal-Mart , but I be not go to hold my breath for result . if you do decide to try it , go to Wal-Mart and save yourself the shipping and the handle through the infomercial , or the extra 17 dollar they be charge through Amazon . hey , you do have the option to save yourself the headache altogether and do not bother to buy it at all . you can get a decent set of weight for about the same price .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this rack be perfect for the at home gym . it hold a good set of weight and be strong . the way each level be set back make be much easier to get the weight off the bottom rack . I be very pleased with this product .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	this be a joke ! if you do not want to ever really workout or ever build a single muscle than this be for you ! come on people !! please !! if you do not want to workout or get in shape , spend you money on food !!!! not something that simply make you feel like you be do something and make someone else rich !! what be next ... 3 second ab ???!!!
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I order what I think be a set of 2 barbell , after all , who buy only one barbell ? apparently , I do because when the shipment arrive , it contain only one . I be irritated with myself for not check the description more closely , but I be also annoy with Amazon for not make it more clear that the barbell be not a set .
Dumbbell	POS	5	it work ! it do what it say . you need to be patient with it , and just like and piece of gym equipment , you have to learn how to use it . whereas I do not recommend this as a replacement for free weight , or you regular gym workout if that be what you be do , I do recommend it as a addition to they . if you do not have free weight , or do not have time to go to the gym , this will do very well . if you can get a 6 minute work-out out of it right away , why be you use it ? -lrb- LOL ! -rrb- seriously , take you time with it , go as long as you can , be patient with it , use all the different exercise routine that it show you how to use -lrb- the include dvd be pretty good , and the website have even more -rrb- , and work up to as long as you can . you will feel it immediately -lrb- A.K.A. sore at first , burn once you get the hang of it - and burn be a good thing ! -rrb- . the only thing I do have to say as a downside to this be the grip . it be a tad uncomfortable , and it get a little slippery when you start to sweat -lrb- and you will ! -rrb- I highly recommend a good set of workout glove with good rubber grip -lrb- Sears sell they - $ 18 -rrb- . other than that , use it regularly , and start slow , just as you would any other workout regimen , and work up to that 6 minute a day workout . no I do not look like the guy in the commercial - yet - but I notice a significant increase in my arm , shoulder , and abdomen muscle . use the dvd and website !! good stuff for $ 30 !
Dumbbell	POS	5	this funny contraption actually work . my arm get tire after a minute ! I recommend to anyone who want to tone they arm . I use while watch tv .
Dumbbell	POS	5	look at several differant type of rack , this one have prove to be very good quality and easy to put together . would highly reccomend product and amazon . I pay $ 87.00 and no shipping .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy these when I want to start work out again . call on my past excuse -lrb- the gym too far , take too long to get there , in , out , and back , et al -rrb- , I know the most effective way to tackle that be to bring what I could to I . also , I live in a apartment so any and all concept of build a actual gym , couple with the fact that I do not waltz around lighting cigar with $ 100 bill , lead I to find a solution . and that solution ? powerblock ! while obviously not provide a full gym , you can do a lot with free weight and cheap weight bench that you can tuck away somewhere . not only be these effectively cheaper than buy a entire set of weight , they be not incline to punch a hole through the floor , annoying my downstairs neighbor and eliminate any hope for my security deposit . they can also be easily stow away behind the couch , under the desk , or wherever you can fit two 45 lb dumbbell . the one and only complaint I have for they be that they do not have a 2.5 jump -lrb- 22.5 , 32.5 , etc -rrb- but they can do 7.5 . I know I be nit pick here but it be nice when you be push to not have to jump 5 lb . also , you can max they out fairly quick with thing like press make it necessary in no time to throw down for the expander set . other than that , though , they have be the best fitness investment I could make ! if you or anyone you know want to find a easy solution to bring the gym home , I would recommend these over any equipment out there .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I love have a full set of freeweight in the size of one pair ! just gotta be careful when you be switch weight because if you have the clip on a diagonal it get dangerous and awkard . overall it be great !!
Dumbbell	NEU	3	First of all , you really need some type of stand to set you SelectTech weight on , and this be probably the one you want since it be make specially for they . the construction be good and solid . it come with solid foot and with caster . you can attach either , depend on whether you plan to leave it in place or need move the stand about . the stationary foot be fine , but the caster that come with mine be very flimsy and too lightweight . they deform under the load when the weight be put onto the stand -lrb- 552 's -rrb- . the wall of the casing hold the wheel flatten some , make it hard to roll the stand . I end up throw these caster away and buy a set of heavy duty caster that be design to take the weight . I can roll the stand easily and smoothly now , but higher quality one should have come with the unit . if you do not think you will be move the stand around , this will not be a issue for you , as the solid foot work well . my other complaint be that I would like to see the stand just a little bit higher , as some other reviewer have mention . I be 5 ' 10 '' and have to stoop just a little when pick the weight up . it be not a big deal because I do not have to bend much at all , but it be something I have to be aware of and careful about because of lower back weakness . another couple of inch in height would have be perfect . but overall , I can recommend the stand .
Dumbbell	POS	5	do what it say it do . I have have my power block for over 3 year and they be as good as new . Great , easy to use , well-made product .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	the product be well-made but nautilus , maker of bowflex product , like many fitness equipment seller , have integrity issue . my stand be obviously a return . the box be poorly retap . when I open the box , the bubble pack with the screw , nut , and washer be open as a person would open a bubble pack by peel off the paper backing . the hardware be scatter all over the box . after sort the hardware and search the box , I be short two washer . there be a small scratch on a leg of the stand . I do not mind a return , but at least , check the stand for nick and miss piece , and retape the box so a return be not so obvious . actually , care about you customer . the building of the stand take I three hour , but there be no problem . the instruction be clear and after I finish I have a quality product to hold my dumbbell . it be a matter of be organize and patient . I use my dummbbell three to four time a week . the stand be essential . when work with 45 pound in each hand , pick these dumbbell off the floor be ask for a pull lower back . the Bowflex dumbbell and the stand be excellent . nautilus suck .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I receive a shake weight for Christmas this year , and I be impressed ! it do seem quite heavy and bulky at first , but now two month later I can most definitely tell the difference in my arm and shoulder . I be plan on send they to everyone next year ! -lrb- ... -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	why do I buy into this fad ? well , the concept behind the weight be actually ingenious . I have be use it for the past month and have see tremendous result . the six minute a day work into my schedule and my arm , back , and shoulder have never look this good .
Dumbbell	POS	5	read a review that say that this product be great to tone specific muscle but will not help a person loose weight . Perfect for those who be already fit who be always look for way to look better or maintain they body . after a few minute of try it out it become clear how it definitely work . good purchase .
Dumbbell	POS	5	Easy to assemble . very sturdy . overall a great value , especially with free shipping . you will be hard press to find another dumbbell rack that be equally well-built and better price .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy this product shortly after break up with my girlfriend to get more `` exercise '' . I truly enjoy the workout although I tend to fall asleep pretty quickly after I be do . however , this product be useful in more way than one . on a recent hike trip in Yellowstone , I kill a charge bear with the shakeweight . BEST MONEY I have ever spent !!!
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I be very excite to try the Shake Weight after read the review when it work for people . I try both the 6 minute video and simply shake it , as long as I could go , and unfortunately I do not see result . while I be do the exercise I could `` feel '' it , but I never actually see result . which be a real bummer , because I commit to the six minute video every day . I decide to stop when I do not see a difference and because , like someone else mention in they review , the shoulder action give I serious pain . as soon as I stop use the Shake Weight , the pain go away . though it do not give I the result I want , I really hope it work for you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be go to my local masseuse for a while now and I always try to tip she well , but lately she have be a bit lazy and just have not be give I the best massage at all . I be give she this for she birthday -lrb- she say she be a leo -rrb- , in the hope that my next tuus na body rub session be more satisfying and she muscle more in shape when it count .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be very skeptical before buy this . I have be work out use standard dumbell but never be able to get a clear definition on my arm . I buy this and after 2 week , I can see my triceps come out of under the layesr of fat . I always have a challenge with biceps show up . . but if I keep work relegiously , I be sure I will see some bicep muscle in a couple month . this be much better than dumb bell and all the curl I have be do . effective product .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I be so sorry to hear that some people be hurt themselves with this item . I have have no problem at all with it and I be very happy with it . I be so bad about do thing consistently and almost do not get this just because I figure it would end up sit around gather dust remind I of what I should be do to get in better shape before it be all down to my ankle . but I have no problem find the time to work out with this . who do not have 6 minute ? it be definitely a work out and I can feel it afterward but not in a bad way . I do not do the behind the head thing for the first several day - perhaps a week or more of use it daily - until I feel more confident with the item itself and comfortable with how it work and shift and all that . then I do not push it because you can feel that you be work on area that usually do not get much attention . if you do it right and as someone else mention `` listen to you body '' you can actually work out stress kink in you neck . I stretch with it in my hand first and I do long slower movement with it at first too to sort of loosen up . just like before any exercise - you should get you muscle warm up first . you should never just jump right in and do vigorous exercise or any exercise you have never do before without test the water first anyway . only you know you body and what it be strength and weakness be . I tend to have problem in my right arm and hand so I try and build up the strength in that arm by do shorter work out with it but more often . since I be horribly right handed - my right hand take all the abuse and all the activity so my left arm be worthless too but in a different way - I work that one out for longer stretch though not as many time during a workout as the right . I end up do they both about the same I just spread out the right one more so I do not aggravate exist problem there and hopefully strengthen it so that the muscle will be stronger and less susceptible to minor tweak and twinge . my arm be get icky flabby even though I be relatively active just because I be not a spring chicken anymore -lrb- though I 'll deny it if you say it out loud to my face -rrb- and they be look - oh i do not know - weird ... lol - but they look so much better now . I swear by this product . just do not go crazy with it right away and do not try and do what the fitness freak do unless you be already one . do what you know you can do and then just push the envelope at you pace a little more everyday . I increase my rep by at least 5 or 10 every work out . now I extend the length of the whole work out itself . I have even start use it to work different area that make my back feel great . oh and this be probably obvious yet it never hurt to mention this - you should really make sure you always drink plenty of water and especially after a work out . that help you muscle too - a lot !!! it really can not be overstate . -lrb- no - I do not work for any organization affiliate or associate with this product -rrb- .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I buy the set , because my trainer have the elite set , which I like . I receive the set damage - plastic be break and plate be off on one of the block . fortunately , Amazon take the set back ; however , I do try the block that be not damage , and it do not feel as sturdy as the elite set . I be surprised especially with all its great review . I end up reordering the 45 lb set instead .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I go to mall and try it . it be kind of fun . right away I come home and get a bottle of water ... who know , it work the same !! just make sure the water have to be very very full . I fill up to half of cap . and you know what ? you can even do two hand with 2 bottle at the same time . it be free
Dumbbell	POS	5	I agree with the other review ... this work great ! my upper arm have become more and more flabby over the year , and within just a few week , I see a shocking improvement . I also do the 6 minute workout daily -lrb- because of the positive result , I be very motivate to keep do it -rrb- , and mostly while watch tv , since it be a easy routine to remember . I also take it on vacation with I , since it do not take up that much room . I have see the absurd comment about it be suggestive , but honestly , do not most excercise look silly when you be do they ? this work great , and I be convince to buy it because the main site offer to not only return the purchase and shipping price , but pay for return shipping if you want to return it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	when I first hear about the shake weight dumbell , I think it be a joke . then I read about it and watch the video and see that it would work in the area that my arms\/shoulders need help with . I find it available thru Amazon.com -lrb- the actual shake weight site be too much $ $ $ -rrb- . when I use the dumbell , I can really feel the arm -lrb- upper , lower , flabby part -rrb- truly be get the muscle go and I have notice some tone since begin with it . 6 minute a day do not sound like a lot , but when you start with this and have not work on you arm in a very long time , it feel tiring and as if you have be work those arm for a hour or so . I think I begin at 2 minute a day and have to reach the full 6 minute in interval over a 15 minute period : -rrb- -lrb- if I be much younger , I probably would not really need something like this to tone my arm and upper body , but be in my 50 's , this seem to work for I . -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	4	nothing fancy , but these will definitely get the job do . the best part of the deal be the very reasonable shipping charge for the pair .
Dumbbell	POS	5	read through all of the review both good and bad . the good be this be a extremely durable and stable rack . it be build solid and hold what it be design to hold . Hexagon dumbbell pair be arrange as follow : top rack , 20-25-30 , middle rack , 35-40-45 , bottom rack , 50-55 and a single adjustable dumbell with 60 lb on it . feel sturdy with all this weight -lrb- ~ 660 lb -rrb- and have be in service for a few month now . I decide to put my lighter weight -lrb- 5 , 8 , 10 , and 15 on a small and much cheaper make Gold 's Gym Christmas tree rack from Walmart . agree with some of the packaging issue be sub-par . one of the sticker on the rack be all chew up from shift around but not really a bother to I . overall , I be very pleased for the price .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	this be a interesting piece of equipment . it do what it say , but there be not much to do with it . there be a limited amount of exercise to do with it . I think you could use this to add to you regular routine . it be nice that it be inexpensive , so add it to you collection of equipment be not a big deal . I would recomend this to someome who want to add some variety to they regular workout .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	it seem from what I have read so far , for many people this product produce some sort of positive result and I will not dispute that . but for the other who write the bad review they word should not be take so lightly or even callously berate . the tv ad be misleading . I do not think anyone expect the weight to shake on its own , `` do the workout for you '' as many critical commenter have claim . but the tv commercial give the illusion that a initial shake must be initiate by the user and some sort of centrifigul method would take over and it would be the responsibility of user to tensely hold the weight use the require muscle need to stabilize it only to find you can not stabilize it , thus cause rapid muscle growth . well it just do not work that way . you have to constantly shake the weight yourself , and I find that a very couterproductive way to permanently build muscle . even in the best of the review nobody really rave about this product so I can not see the logic as to why they rate this 5 or even 4 star . go figure . update 1\/21\/2012 . alright I see this sit on the shelf at Walgreen 's a long time ago and I ignore it . then I go to CVS . on the same day ! again I see one lone Shake Weight for Men sit knee high on the shelf . I walk away . but the thought pursue I . be this fate ? should I buy it or not ? will the person at the register laugh at I ? will it offer some sort of benefit ? so I cave in and buy it . when I get home and open it inside there be a dvd on how to use this thing properly . the goal be to shake the weight vigorously steadily and firmly without wobble it for 30 seconds per exercise . the best I can get be 22 seconds . when you use the Shake Weight properly it will make a whooshing noise . if you hear a kadunk kadunk kadunk you be do it wrong ! as for the benefit themselves , that be just simply go to depend on you own current physical condition . for I I find the Shake Weight to be great for warm up before real exercise or for add a quick firm-up AFTER real exercise .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I number of the review note that this thing be very difficult to put together . I do not find that to be the case at all . follow the direction and it be a snap . well , maybe not a snap , it take I 45 minute while I be watch tv . one great piece of advice that come from another review be crucial . there be three different set of bolt that be very close in length . Make sure you line these bolt up and use the correct length for each use . if you blow it here it could be a very long , frustrating operation . perhaps this be where people be go wrong with this rack ? if you have the Bowflex barbell , you really should get this rack .
Dumbbell	POS	4	exercise with the Shake Weight make you look ridiculous . it be true . but forget about that . the first time you manage to finish the six-minute workout routine , you 'll realize just how effective it be . the Shake Weight be not motorize , however , which many people seem to expect -lrb- even I do -rrb- . you be the one generate the motion of the dumbell . you be the motor . the dumbbell itself be well-constructed and obviously much easier to use and store than just about any other piece of home gym equipment . at only five pound , I do not have high expectation for the kind of workout this thing would produce - but I be definitely please with the result . even after only three week of do six minute a day , I have see improvement . my triceps be more solid , and I be start to get a bit of bicep definition . it be a pretty good feeling get noticeable result from just six minute a day ! the bottom line be that for $ 30 , you do not have to worry about look ridiculous . just try it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I recently get this dumbbell rack and could not be happier . I have two cat and dumbbell range from 5 to 45 lb . anyone who have cat know that that combo be a recipe for great gob of cat fur collect under the weight and no matter how often you vaccuum or sweep , it somehow manage to recongregate . this rack get all the dumbbell off the floor , prevent the collection of fur and other dirt , and make the weight a lot more accessible . the one comment to add to those of the other here be that this rack really only work well with hexagonal dumbbell . I have two round-bell 10-pound dumbbell and when I try to place they on the rack , they slip off and fall . so I have have to replace they . I prefer the hexagonal anyway , but if you have nothing but round-bell weight , you might want to look at a different design . but if you have the standard hexagonal , you 'll love this . it be compact , solid , and surprisingly solid for the price . plus , if you be a Amazon Prime member , it will ship for free , which be pretty amazing give its weight . I highly recommend this rack .
Dumbbell	POS	4	it do actually work . you will feel the burn right from the begining . you 'll start do it and think this be not so bad , but after 15-20 seconds you start to feel it . the dvd really be only a $ 1 value in my view as it do not really add any benefit that the enclosed booklet do not tell you .
Dumbbell	POS	5	have work out at several gym for the past 2 year or so , these be the most versatile dumbbell I have encounter . now that I be in graduate school , I do not have as much time to drive to the gym , so I make a little home gym and add these to my collection . these weight be AMAZING . at first , I be a bit skeptical of the idea of square dumbbell , but the shape do not interfere with most exercise that you 'll be do . honestly , within 2 day , I be about to set the weight on these dumbbell within seconds . simply slide the pin in and out . I find these far more convenient than have a whole set of traditional dumbbell . I definitely recommend this product .
Dumbbell	POS	5	over the past two to three year I have buy pair from 10 lb . to 60 lb . I have be very happy with they . they be solid , the handle have a slightly checkered grip which be nice when you hand be sweaty . if you have look at other manufacturer 's you may have notice the size of comparable weight can vary , less costly weight be usually larger than the cap 's . the cap weight be a reasonable size until you get beyond 60 lb , in that case , well , they be just plain big .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I receive what I purchase with this . it be a 20 lb dumbbell . the only thing I be not happy about be that it be only sell as a single dumbbell instead of a pair . I misunderstand this when I order . I like the grip and it seem like the hex shape be easier to use than other dumbbell .
Dumbbell	POS	5	my yorkie be very picky about she treat but she love these . they keep she busy chew which be a nice break from the whining ! anybody who have ever own a yorkie know how much attention they will demand from you ... these treat give she something to do when I need to get thing do . love they !
Dumbbell	POS	4	very nice quality . love the color . easy to grip . recommend it for anyone who want something bright-colored and cheery to use during they workout !
Dumbbell	POS	5	after read some of the review , I be concern that put this together would be a pain , but I enter cautiously , make sure to keep the 2.5 inch bolt separate from the 2.75 inch bolt and the 3 inch bolt , then just follow the direction make sure to use the correct piece . construction really take only about 45 minute . I be one who usually do not follow direction during assembly , or at least use they as a last resort , but after read the review , I decide to follow they this time and construction be a breeze . do not let the other review scare you away . now for the stand ... very solid , perfect height . you do not want to have to pick 50 pound off the floor , so these stand be essential to save you back . I be tall -lrb- 6 ' 3 '' -rrb- , and the height be perfect . I have no worry that the stand will last forever . the weight be awesome too ! if you be serious about work out , invest in this and you will not regret it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the dumbell set be perfect for begin weight user and\/or for light weight . the rack be easy to assemble and the weight themselves be ergonomic and comfortable to use .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this only take I 45 min to setup and be straightforward . the only reason I gve 4 star be it be pricey for what it be , but be good relief for back and quick p90x weight change .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be work out at home with p90x for about 4 week prior to purchase this stand . I have to say that the ability to not struggle and strain my back be definately worth the price .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I have be look for a rack to organize we small workout area but could never find something that I think be build well for less than $ 100 until I find the apex rack . this rack exceed my expectation for quality , construction and ease of assembly . and Amazon continue to amaze I with they great service ... I receive the rack in two day and shipping be free . what a deal !
Dumbbell	POS	5	the weight come quickly and we be better than I could have expect . I use they everyday and have see no wear or issue with they what so ever . the stand look really flimsy when I first take it out but it be small and lightweight but defiantly do the trick . altogether it be the perfect set for my home workout .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy these to start the p90x program . not be very athletic , I think the 3-24 pound weight would be enough . they be solid and well design . change weight be a snap . although they be fine start out , I realize that I would quickly outgrow these weight as I progress through the workout series . 24 pound seem like a lot of weight if you have not be lifit before but after a few week you will wish you have more resistance on some exercise . I return these and get the Powerblock Sport 5.0 that cover 5-50 pound instead . they be both great product , vastly superior to the rubber band for p90x -lrb- which be ok as a last resort , but free weight be much more challenging and provide a better workout -rrb- . if you plan on do less weight and more rep , then the 3-24 pound set may be appropriate .
Dumbbell	POS	5	this rack work perfectly for my hex dumbbell from 20-50lbs . the smaller weight do not fit as well but since they be lighter , I be not that concern with pinch a finger between the weight and the rack .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the Apex Deluxe 3-Tier Dumbbell Rack be well make . the weld be good and its easy to put together ; it take I about 10 minute to assemble . a great buy .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	after read a ton of review I finally give into curiosity and buy the shake weight . and while many of the review who talk about feel a burn be correct I think it be important to consider the situation of the user make the review -lrb- which be not always clear -rrb- . for I , I work out a couple of time a week at a normal gym use mostly free weight that be a lot heavier than the shake weight , I have honestly find the shake weight routine to be a good way to get a bit more of a muscle burn . however , I do not feel that the weight itself create a lot more resistance than do high volume rep at weight that be 5-10 lb less than you normal set . that say , my girlfriend who do not do a ton of free weight work and instead focus she work out on cardio and yoga get a really strong burn and be even sore the next day . thus far she be find that the shake weight have seemingly be pretty effective as a addition to she routine and something that be very valuable . point being , different people will get totally different result . personally , I think the product be pretty interesting and I 'll probably continue to use it at longer interval , but I honestly do not think you 'll end up look like the fitness trainer if this be all you do . also I might feel differently if there be a slightly heavier version of the product or on that require more effort to shake .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	from read previous review I be dread the assembly of this stand . to my surprise , the instruction be clear and easy to follow and I have the stand put together in just under a hour . after assembly the stand I notice the stand be very sturdy and well build . I take my Bowflex SelectTech 552 weight out of the holder and place the holder in the stand . upon do so the holder do not fit right in the stand . they be a bit to wide and long . to fix this I use a hand towel and a adjustable wrench . place the hand towel over the rear edge , I use the pliers to bed they back and inch or so . its important to do the rear edge because the front one hold all the weight . they dont fit perfectly but they do now fit in the stand . overall I be very happy with the strength and look of the stand but wish it would have take no modifying .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I think I be get a bargain . these be great dumbell , but they be 30 % cheaper locally . I think the mazon price be for a pair . it be not .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	my Aunt tell that she love this thing . it be a stupid . and , I can not believe I buy it .
Dumbbell	POS	5	not much to say really . the price be definitely reasonable and to have it ship right to the front door be nice . when I need heavier one , I will come back here . : -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	the stand be excellent , it hold the dumbell without give or sway even when you body weight lean over the dumbell during position . this be the second stand I have purchase , the first stand hold my 552 dumbell set -lrb- now go on two year -rrb- . very well design for save you back during lifting . the only difference from my previous stand be that this one do not have a chrome finish , otherwise it be great .
Dumbbell	POS	4	the selecttech 552 stand be a sharp look piece of equipment and be easy to set up . do not let some review scare you ... if you can pick up a tool and look at a picture , you can put this together . a little pricey , however , consider what they charge for they dumbell . this stand should be include .
Dumbbell	NEG	1	I purchase a shake weight online and the company sell all my information to herbal life . herbal life call I about once a week since I purchase the shake weight ask I to buy pill , etc. . if I have know that the company that sell shake weight do that I would not have give my phone number to be harass nor would I have buy the item . I have ask nicely and also very sternly ; yet they still continue to call . nothing be worth what I be go thru . yes , the product work fine -lrb- thus the one star -rrb-
Dumbbell	POS	5	it work great . it take a little while to get use to it , but my flabby arm start get tone and that what I want .
Dumbbell	POS	4	this be a no-brain-er it do as advertise the only catch be only you have to use it but it do work . not sure about the 4 star rating since the system will not allow any less ...
Dumbbell	POS	4	product arrive quickly . I purchase both this and the Bowflex SelectTech Dumbell stand and I be impress by how heavy\/sturdy they be . assembly for both be a breeze . Bowflex clearly have they act together . if it be I I would have include some form of ` lock mechanism between the base of the dumbell holder and this stand .
Dumbbell	NEU	3	I think the purchase be for a pair -lrb- 2 weight -rrb- !! bottom line : it be too expensive for just one dumbell compare to a local sport store -lrb- where I have previously purchase 5 # neoprene weight -rrb- . also the 2nd one be a slightly different color . not a big deal , but annoy . it be a pretty self-explanatory product ... neoprene dumbell . bc it be neoprene , it have a nice grip and protect the weight .
Dumbbell	POS	5	very please with the price and performance . not foolproff but simple check assure no mishap with loose weight .
Dumbbell	POS	4	go to goo gle and type in `` shake weight for man review '' choose the second one under amazon which be world of diet . a small word on use both male and female version of this product if you can not figure out how to find the report . while the woman 's version may be only 2.5 pound it cause resistance measure of 32.5 pound . do the math the male version of 5 pound provide 65 pound of resistance . you be not get the full range of motion you would from a dumbbell but what you be get be 3 time the effect in the shorter motion result in better toning than muscle mass . for everyone that be injure it be because you be treat it like a 5 pound weight . there be spring within this thing that cause the resistance measure to hit up to 32.5 to 65 pound when you shake it . treat it like the resistance machine you find at a gym , that line do not weight 100 pound but through resistance it sure as heck can feel like it and give you the same benefit . that be say its the company fault for not appropriately designate the actual resistance this thing cause . again its simulation review not perform by real people but simulation be use in everything these day and the company have a very accurate simulation from what I can tell . be careful when use this product and by all means start out slow until you positive you can use this without get injure . oh and do not forget to stretch before and after like you suppose to else you will get injure as with any work out equipment . eat healthier and stay away from fake butters\/margine , whole grain\/wheat , corn , banana , fast food , and believe it or not orange juice will cause you to gain weight . you will lose weight and build muscle but do not rely on any one thing to get you to where you want to be . like other have say if you want to really get into shape use this in combination with other thing or wait until you endurance be up to the 3-4 time a day thing . slowly pace yourself and you will get there .
Dumbbell	POS	4	solid , balanced dumbbell . allow I to cancel my gym membership and and work out at home . I have never be a fitness buff so I be not suggest this replace a gym , but for I it be great . I can pop off a couple set in the morning , couple more set at night during a commercial break , do a set of pushup to mix it up , etc. . it add up . one minor ding , fleck of paint have chip off when the end of the dumbbell touch during a workout , which be a little annoying if you be do overhead press , but I be assume that will stop as the paint wear off . I read one review that a dumbbell crack apart during a workout . these be cast metal piece that have be weld together , the odds be low but it be possible , so I do not let they strike together too hard when I be exercise .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I be give this rack as a birthday gift and I be very very happy with it . from a size perspective , its rack be not long enough to hold more than 3 set of big weight , and it do protrude out away from the wall more than what I would have think . but those be some pretty small gripe give the price point . I have mine set up as follow : top rack 8 , 10 , 15 & 20 ; middle rack hold the 25 , 30 & 35 dumbbell , and finally the lower rack have my 40 & 45er . I be kinda uncertain whether I can squeeze in a 50lb set , if I should ever get that strong to need they ... again , I be very pleased with this rack . its size related shortcoming be easily offset by its competitive price point .
Dumbbell	POS	5	it be a workout build the stand but I love it . the stand pretty much save my back during p90x super set . I should have buy it earlier . bring it !
Dumbbell	POS	5	I buy this item because the physics of it make complete sense to I . I just finish my second time use the shake weight . the first time be right after I open it , and I try the various workout show . it be not too bad . the second time I use it after my daily routine consist of ab work out , push up , dip and pull up . it usually take I 5-10 minute . once I finish , it be 3:56 . I decide to wait until 3:57 so that I could time myself for one minute . I have never want 3:58 to come so badly . it burn not only in my arm but in my ab as well . if use on its own it may not be as effective , however it be a great finishing touch on my workout today . P.S. . you have to be SUPER FRAIL to use the women product . it be half the weight of the man 's . man will build muscle and in turn need to move up in weight . buy the man 's version .
Dumbbell	POS	5	I 'll keep this simple . the weight themselves be weighty . the cover make they easy to hold , and exercise with they be fine . I have absolutely nothing negative to say about they . the stand be basic plastic , but be sturdy and do a fine job of hold the weight in a compact manner . come with a extra screw too , in case one vanish . if you be look for a basic lightweight set like I be , you can not go wrong here .
Dumbbell	POS	5	the Shake Weight do what it claim . it do not take much , but the result be feel immediately . good for different exercise . I will get another . Shake Weight.com
Dumbbell	POS	5	I start the p90x workout a few week ago and begin use the rubber resistance band . however , when I switch to this set of weight the workout become much more challenging . I highly recommend these over the band if possible . change weight be a snap so you can easily keep up with the video . the product feel solid and high quality . yes , there be a price premium for the Powerblocks but they be much quicker than change plate weight and they take up much less room than a set of dumbbell . highly recommend . no offense to Amazon , but due to ship cost , try to buy they locally if you can . I pay $ 269 + tax for the Sport 5.0 set which cover 5-50 pound in 5 pound increment . unless you be a bodybuilder , this weight will cover all the exercise in p90x . and the Sport series can be upgrade to 65 pound if you really must have it .
Dumbbell	POS	4	I recently have a serious back surgery and I be always look for new thing to keep I motivated exercise as it be very important for I to avoid further back problem . the novelty aspect of Shake Weight Dumbbell attract my attention . this weight be a molded plastic handle with a spring at each end that compress and extend as you shake it back and forth . I like they because they add a bit of variety to my exercise routine . however , they be not provide a harder workout or burn more calorie than the traditional weight . a recent consumer report -lrb- July 2011 -rrb- do electrocardiographic study to judge how effective the Shake Weight system be and find that it be not any better than traditional weight . it do not not mean you should not use these weight , the study just clarify that it be not a magic bullet . any resistance exercise build strength and any movement build calorie , and so do Shake Weight system . if the novelty of Shake weight get you exercise it do its job !
Headphone	NEG	2	the lack of detail be annoy with these headphone . . a example would be while listen to a acoustic jazz album it be almost impossible to differentiate the cymbal from the rest of the instrument . .
Headphone	POS	5	in reality i give these a 4.5 since sweat destroy they . but thankfully I do not buy they for exercise . they have stay in my ear without any discomfort or agitation for several hour . sound be balanced , bass be full , and it come with a array of ear piece to ensure you get a good fit . if you can do physical activity without sweating these make be suitable bud for you , but otherwise you be look at a very short lifespan with wetness on these . though the cord and ear piece be design well the material feel a tiny bit cheap , so you definitely want to take great care of you set . you can easily do so by store it in the small case it come with . overall great sound , excellent design . if they make it in a sturdier material without change touching sound quality , I would happily buy that pair as well .
Headphone	POS	4	these be really good headphone . they be not the absolute best that money can buy but they be very good still . the Noise isolation be work well . the bass be pretty deep as long as you have the right ear cushion in . the smaller piece you have in , the better it be , and easier it stay in you ear . overall it be be a good purchase . pro : Audio quality , bass , noise iso . con : price , control talk control do not work on android , earbud be heavy and can fall out when walk .
Headphone	POS	5	I want to let everyone know that this be a great item . Perfect for work out or run because now you do not have to deal with the wire . I have never see a wireless set of headphone ! highly RECOMEND !!!!
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone have a excellent sound quality for the price . it have a deep bass that , in my opinion , be well balance with the high and low . I play bass guitar , so I tent to enjoy a bass that be a little more pronounced rather then be subdue . the headphone themselves , while large in size , be comfortable and durable . my wife stretch they to they limit to place this on she belly so we soon-to-be-born son can listen , and there be no damage or stretch on the part of the headphone . after have use earbud for so long , I be amaze at the nuance in my music and movie that I can hear with these headphone . great job Sony !
Headphone	POS	4	I fall in love with the design of these headphone . I really like the retro look , and I absolutely adore over the ear headphone ! I be not a big fan of stick ear bud into my ear . I think the red part be go to be metal , but its actually plastic , but that be not a big deal . the mesh ear cup actually provide pretty decent noise isolation which mean do not have to crank up the volume to drown out background noise ! I use these on my computer and the sound be very clear and very nice . I listen to music on my computer , since I dont have a mp3 : -lrb- , and so the sound be pretty balanced , but I be no music expert , so that my 2 cent worth about the sound . when I do plug these into a mp3 player , the sound be pretty quiet low . I be surprise . I have to crank up the volume to listen at a good listening volume ! this be mostly surprising because I absolutely do not listen to music at a loud volume because my hearing be important to I ! so I be pretty disappoint by that fact since I be plan on get a mp3 and would have like to use these . another thing be that if there be wind outside or a breeze , you actually hear the `` whoosh '' sound ! this obviously interfere with the music , especially because if you outside with these headphone it mean you be use a mp3 player , and if you use a mp3 player the sound isnt that loud anyway ! and for I , even if the noise isnt that loud I dare not crank it up too much because I do not want to damage my hearing , so that be disappointing . I love the look , the sound quality and volume be amazing when use on a computer , which be where I spend most of my time listen to music and what not . one other thing I notice about these headphone , after about a couple hour of use they , with break in between , my head start hurt a bit . I dont know if its just because of the pressure that the cup place on my ear -lrb- which really isnt much it doesnt squeeze you head ! -rrb- , but I have a small headache , and I dont ever get headache . overall I think these be pretty decent headphone for wear in door while work , play , or listen to stuff on the computer , but for outdoor usage I would not recommend it . Hope y' all find this review helpful !
Headphone	POS	5	they ship promptly , they do what you expect , and they be not cheap junk . ca not say it better than that .
Headphone	POS	5	i wash they twice by accident they still work . you wont be disappoint . love they so much the only downfall to they be that they sound just too loud sometimes but they be the best headphone i ever own
Headphone	POS	5	I have own the iGrado 's for about 6 month now , and after extensive heavy usage they be still work perfectly . the sound be phenomenal for a product that be intend to deal mostly mp3 file . with these you can easily tell the difference in music file that be 128kbps vs 320kbps ; thus , you be obviously go to want file with larger rate . as far as the comfort level go , the headband be not adjustable , but it form to my head rather quickly and have be comfortable for I since . my biggest problem with these headphone be actually the spot where the wire connect to the headphone , as they be constantly be bent when they be set down , put on , etc. . however , they have yet to show any sign of give out , so it might not be a big deal . Definatley a good buy .
Headphone	NEU	3	I think this be a update model of Sony mdr-ex76 . as Sony mdr-ex76 , this mdr-ex86 's sound be pretty good . it be quite natural and clear . however , one problem with mdr-ex86 be that it discomfort my ear because of its bulky phone part . after 3-4 hour of its use , it really bother the inside of my both ear . probably , my ear have a problem . because its sound be not greatly different from mdr-ex76 's sound , I still like mdr-ex76 .  Sony mdr-ex76 \/ blk ex Style Headphones with carry case -lrb- black -rrb-
Headphone	POS	5	this be by far the best pair of earphone I have ever have . my first pair break and I didnt hesitate to spend the ask price for a new pair . they be great for work out . they wont fall out and they dont hurt you ear like the other earphone do -lrb- after extensive wear -rrb- . also this be the best quality sound I have hear for the price and the size . its just perfect for I and it even match my pink nano ipod .
Headphone	POS	5	I be a drummer , and be look for some good , professional look and sound in ear monitor . I be think about spend $ 99 plus for a pair of Shure in ear 's . but then I find these , for only $ 17 !! they look so professional , like pro drummer wear these . for the price , they can not be beat !
Headphone	NEG	2	I buy Labtec 835 go by the revieww , but now i have stop believee review and specificationg ... , these headfone be bad , no real volume with clarity , sick bass , i mean only u can listen to something like a lecture ... ! good thing , these headfone be real comfortable ! but then pay 16 $ for that ??? pay a little more and get something better ! I didnt like these headfone at all ! if u r a music lover , u wont like they , dont buy they ! else u regret ...
Headphone	NEU	3	these be my first Sennheiser Headphones . I purchase they base upon the glowing review for they sound . I just also buy a pair of Sony 7506 headphone at about the same price range . the Sony 's blow these out of the water . the 7506 's have deeper bass , better imaging , extend treble , and be more sensitive . they also seem to mate better with my Yamaha receiver for impedance purpose . the Sennheiser hd-280 's will give you better sound than less expensive headphone , but both the Sony 7506 and v700dj model be overall better in sound , sensitivity , power handling , and distortion .
Headphone	POS	4	so I buy a pair and receive they today . I be happy with the packaging and all but all I be really concern about be that the `` l '' and `` r '' symbol be both write towards the inside of the little square metal piece -lrb- towards where the bud face you ear for each earpiece instead of towards the back of they -rrb- . I do not know if this be a indication that its fake or something , but the Beats symbol be also a little scratch . the zipper on my case have already have paint chip , also , be the warranty really 3 year ? do anyone else have the same problem ? do these problem indicate that these headphone be fake ?
Headphone	POS	5	it be so nice to listen to the song I like when I be on the computer and the T.V. be on next to I and I can not hear it .
Headphone	NEG	1	I get these as a sad gift - the overall sound quality be quite bad -lrb- when nc - noise cancellaton-is turn off -rrb- . not much low frequency and minimal high frequency content . so purely as headphone - they fall at the bottom of the heap . with nc turn on , there be some amplification of the sound - so it sound louder . the nc effect itself - well - its kind of work , but not much . probably about 20 percent of the noise be take care of . do not even try compare the performance of the bose to these -lrb- I do so - use a co-passenger bose qc3 - and it be a revelation - one work beautifully and this one barely do so -rrb- . I plan to get a pair of Panasonic RPHC300 now -lrb- since I do not have $ 300 to burn -rrb- . I be curious how the nc effect be implement for the left and right earpiece . there be no wire that connect the right side -lrb- with the battery and nc electronics -rrb- with the left earpiece . go figure this one out : -rrb- . I have some idea - but that would mean this be not a stereo headset . too lazy to experiment further with this piece of junk . the good thing be they fold quite well .
Headphone	POS	4	these headphone sound amazing for the price , way better than I expect they to . for 13 buck they be a steal . my only complaint be that they do not fit my ear well . I have average size ear , maybe even a little on the small side but for some reason they just do not fit right . my left ear feel pinch ... however it do not bother I enough for I to stop wear they . I use they w \/ my creative mp3 player and they sound a lot better than the earbud it come with . I like the volume control on the wire . overall these be great headphone , especially for the price .
Headphone	POS	4	these be a good replacement for the ipod ear bud , which I hate ! they do not cost much , they do not fall out of you ear and it do not bother I when I end up give they away to my nephew and neice , when they lose they headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	I be worry about the price , but these headphone honestly have a better overall feel and sound than my skullcandy . they have unique bud that fit very well in my ear and do a excellent job of cut out sound . I have now have these for a few month and they still work fine .
Headphone	NEU	3	we buy two pair of these and they work reasonably well of the price . sound quality be so-so , noise-cancelling be good , but the piece of plastic that hold the headphone open -lrb- when unfold -rrb- be go to break . we also have both pair lose sound in one sound over time . we do not treat thing roughly or use they all that much . anyway , while they work they be a decent deal and if you figure you can have five pair of these for the same price as one of the bose it might be acceptable .
Headphone	POS	4	the good : this thing do what it say it will do and sound pretty awesome . you will not use the full volume without do ear damage , unless you already have ear damage . it successfully take the underpowered Razor Maxx output and deliver excellent sound , while improve the range -lrb- bass . -rrb- the Bad : I do not know how they define `` normal use '' , but 10 hour be a pipe dream . I be lucky to get a hour out of it at perhaps half its volume potential . if they make a bigger one that hold a bigger battery , that would actually last 10 hour ; I would pay 5 time the price in a heartbeat ... and probably 10 . that be say ; this thing be still worth every penny they be ask for it , as the price be very fair for what you actually get .
Headphone	NEG	2	well like a lot of the other folk who have post , this be a really great service . I be surprised there be not more product on the market like this . the manufacturing and design of the headphone however be severely lack . after only have this product for 5 month , the back of the headphone have crack . I just get off the phone with the customer service folk and as long as you have the receipt they be refund money and not replace they at all . I think there be too many fundamental flaw with the design .
Headphone	NEU	3	we purchase 25 of these headphone for a computer lab at we school . for the most part , the sound be decent , and they be relatively comfortable for the price . we select this model because of the affordability and the reduce likelihood of anyone want to walk off with a pair due to the rather clunky and unattractive design . -lrb- and to that credit , none have walk off yet . -rrb- however , we have now have to dig the end of the headphone jack out of five computer , as five of we pair have break off inside the computer audio port , simply from regular plug and unplug of the headphone . so , they may save you money in the beginning , but I would highly recommend throw they out after a year and buying replacement so you do not risk damaging you audio device when the 1\/8 '' jack break off inside of they .
Headphone	NEG	2	the headphone be fine . the microphone be awful . it twist away easily and really do not have enough heft to work unless you hold the piece up to you face while talk . it be a real disappointment . note the audio control do not work on my android phone or MacBook , which I think be suppose to have the same control as a iPhone . you may want to double-check its compatibility with you phone .
Headphone	NEU	3	I have own this pair of headphone for a year now and I would say that these be worth the purchase . I be write a review now because after a year of use , the right headphone finally snap off . even consider that , these headphone remain worth the price . pro - great sound quality ; Clear and handle bass really well that can otherwise be inaudible . - tight ; if you be in a loud environment , these will definitely make sure that no outside noise leak in while listen . - cord ; very long , conveniently wrap around , and very unobtrusive when wear the headphone . con - headband strap be incredibly flimsy ; the plastic inside of it appear to crinkle and crack to adjust to you head 's shape in a unflattering manner . the strap 's connector to the headband be make of fiber and very prone to twist . this cause I to fumble around with they every time before wear to twist they back into place . - screw be not tight ; somehow , one of the screw on the left headphone fall out a while ago . the headphone manage to remain attached , however . - uncomfortable after heavy use ; I use my headphone daily for many hour at a time and I experience soreness after remove they . - ear pad ; very prone to collect strand of hair and debris and be not easy to clean . they do remain removable , however , as I have remove and place they back on a few time before . - durability ; if you plan on use you headphone frequently for extended period of time , I do not recommend these headphone because of they cheap build and discomfort .
Headphone	POS	5	very fast shipment . excellent sound quality , great bass . slick cord . fit great . look durable , let 's hope it be . really great sound for the price .
Headphone	POS	5	the Sennheiser RS140 Wireless Headphones be phenomenal . we have 2 headset on one charger . I set the television volume low -lrb- or even mute the tv -rrb- and my husband and I adjust we headphone to we individual comfort level . they work in every room of we home so I can prepare dinner and not miss my favorite show . in addition , the sound be crisp , clear and enhance . it be a wonderful product and I highly recommend it . this be not just for hear impaired .
Headphone	NEG	1	these bud do not flex at all & be way too big for my average size ear . the sound be okay for the price , but they hurt to use !!
Headphone	POS	4	I agonize a few day over my new selection - so many option . sound quality be so subjective . I mostly ignore that aspect in review , but I will say that `` I '' like the quality and find it superior to any of the dozen or so sub $ 40 bud I have use -lrb- and lose -rrb- . I be surprised and pleased with the quality of the low-end part of the spectrum . the other element I be after be `` tangle-resistance '' . these be so resistant , they may be make of a yet-undisclosed state of matter , solid , but ... ; -rrb- they also be very comfortable with a good isolation seal of the ear canal . the dark red color of the the cable and the nice little case may help I hang on to these for more than a year ! the only niggle I can cite be the `` rasp '' of sound conduction via the cable as it move on you clothing . however , I consider this to be minor and be expect with tangle-resistance . all in all , a good value .
Headphone	NEU	3	pro : - sound quality much better than the amazon price - loudness - fit comfortably on ear , adjustable a bit con : - build quality be poor - pad feel thin\/cheap so that be about it for I .
Headphone	NEG	2	the shape of the ear bud take a lot of get use to . there be more comfortable over-the-ear model available than this .
Headphone	POS	5	just get these pair of headphone for my office , base on my husband 's recommendation . these be light , comfortable and very good quality , suitable for long duration use . one of the problem I have face with some other headphone : 1 . too big to fit on my head and keep dangle . 2 . Start hurt my head or ear after some time . 3 . audio quality suck . these have a snug fit for head of any size and do not hurt or irritate at all . love they .
Headphone	POS	5	I have have these headphone for 2 year now . so you people who Broke Yours in a Month or less do not take good CARE of THIS PRODUCT . I be a DJ and Use these and the over the ear Solo beat Headphones both Great Sound and Quality .
Headphone	POS	5	I love music and have buy really expensive head phone that be not as good as the px 100 . they be the best head phone for the price . so much so I buy a second pair to work out in . yes I be a audiophile geek and I be very critical about my sound . no 128 bit rate for I I need 320. : - -rrb-
Headphone	POS	4	the most important thing by far for wireless headphone be comfort , and these really excel in the comfort department . I can wear they for hour and not feel like I want to take they off . the comfort seem to be from three factor : 1 . they be relatively light weight , 2 . they have a wide foam pad that rest on you head around the ear , not on the ear , and 3 . they do not clamp down on you head too tight , just tight enough to stay on . the only comfort issue be that they be big and bulky enough that you can not lay the side of you head on a pillow with they on like you can with in-ear headphone . seriously , do not buy uncomfortable wireless headphone no matter how great they seem otherwise . I have very high standard for sound quality as a person who build my own high end speaker , and I can definitely say there be headphone that sound better , include my wire mdr-v6 headphone . the main problem be that the bass be weak . from midrange up to treble the sound be very good , and most people would be very satisfied with it , include myself . but the reception be great ... as long as any part of the headphone have line of sight to the receiver there be no cutout or static anywhere in the living room . of course as soon as you leave the room the ir signal cut out . the surround processing be not very good . just like most DSP mode on receiver , it make for tinny distorted sound . maybe it do steer the sound somewhat but the overall degradation be not worth it . I leave the headphone in music -lrb- non-surround -rrb- mode even for surround source because it give a cleaner sound . I live in a condo , and even though I have higher quality speaker , I find myself usually use these headphone for movie and tv because it be just so cool to be able to listen loud enough that you can hear all the dialog all the time with no concern about annoy the neighbor . listen through the speaker I be always turn the volume down during explosion or crash and turn the volume up during quiet dialog . with these headphone you do not have to do that so you be more immerse . most people seem to think the surround processing on these be pretty much state of the art and yet I think it be useless . so my suggestion would be to not buy headphone for surround processing . just find a pair of comfortable headphone that have decent sound quality and you 'll be set . since these headphone cost so much due to the surround processing , they be probably not a great value . the other minor complaint I have be that there be no way to turn the base station on or off remotely ... it be the only device I have to actually get up and walk over to turn on . after a few year of use , mine be develop a problem where the sound cut off if I leave my dvr on pause for a long time . this use to happen just a few percent of the time but now it be start to happen almost half the time that I do a long pause . the problem seem to be in the base unit ; unplug the toslink and switch the base on and off restore the sound . I be in the market for a new set of wireless headphone . I be consider get another set of these use to replace the base unit , and that way I 'll have two set of headphone so my girlfriend and I can listen together late at night without wake other up .
Headphone	NEG	1	anyone say these earphone have a good sound must have very low standard ! they have absolutely `` no BOTTOM END '' at all . I DJ for a living and play all type of music and can appreciate good sound quality . these have neither good sound quality , nor any bass at all . I do not expect they to have the same sound quality as a $ 200 pair , but these do not even compare with `` stock '' earphone , let alone aftermarket . I actually think someone have be mess with my mp3 player and turn the bass off . to my surprise , the bass be turn all the way up . I 'll admitt , I do love a good rich bass sound , nothing muddy or `` boomy '' , just bass and drum the way they suppose to sound . these earphone do not even have the slighest hint of bass as far as I could tell . they do not impress I in the upper end either . mostly all I hear be mid 's . Kinda like the sound that come from a cheep alarm clock . well I guess I 'll keep try until I hit the `` SWEET '' spot that I be look for . maybe a good pair of shure or ultimate ear eb or pro . but you can rest assure , it will not be another pair of sony 's .
Headphone	NEG	2	you would imagine this one should be better than the original one , but in fact , the noise cancellation be so poor my wife instantly decide to return it . bose qc 15 be more expensive , but it do a much better job cancel the noise .
Headphone	POS	4	unlike what some people be complain about , I get the item that be picture . it also work as advertise for my LG Cosmos . there be only one problem I have with this adapter : the connection be finicky . sometimes if I twist the plug on my phone jack , I can hear the sound go rather quiet . so , either the jack on my phone be bad or the wiring in the adapter be not the greatest . regardless , it be only a little over a dollar and still work pretty well so I be not really complain .
Headphone	POS	4	I use these for run with my ipod - the cord be a little short but the sound be quite good and I find they more comfortable than bud when I be sweating .
Headphone	NEG	1	I can not believe these get the kind of review they get . they sound horrible on every level . the earphone that come with my ipod so outdo these it be pitiful !! do not waste you money !
Headphone	POS	5	these be order for a gift and I end up keep they for myself . the sound quality be wonderful . do the stylish case , they be easy to pack and take with I when I travel .
Headphone	POS	5	First of all these be very very high quality build headphone , thick plush leather , strong dense aluminum . they be over the ear head phone , and be very snug and comfortable . I have hear of people say they hurt , that be a total lie unless you have huge ear but my ear fit perfectly inside the cup . I would buy these again and again . they be the best dre headphone out there . they be $ -lrb- ... -rrb- with shipping , but I guess I have they now , lol . they be very expensive to what I really think they should be sell for but they be worth it if the Studios be $ -lrb- ... -rrb- . these be total show stopper and have a very clean sound . I have use but not purchase one over $ 1000 but they be for more of a recording purpose type of headphone . these be truly a great product but think they will require alot of juice to run off of a ipod . again these fit well on normal size ear .
Headphone	NEG	2	the headphone work really well out of the box , with better sound quality than the earbud that come with the iphone . however , I experience malfunction of the volume control after a indoor run on the treadmill -lrb- 10k -rrb- ; perhaps some moisture get into the wiring ? after dry , it again become functional . a rather unexpected problem , since one of the tout quality be water resistance . outdoor running do not seem to cause the same problem . it happen again after a shorter run -lrb- 5k -rrb- , again on the treadmill indoors . I guess the sweat get into the control stick and temporarily render it nonfunctional . overall , I get less than what I expect from a rather pricy headset .
Headphone	POS	5	the j3 Micro earbud be fantastic . to anyone look for some great earbud look no further the quality of theses earbud for the money be unsurpassed . I will be buy another pair of these just to have a spare . great job jlab . oh and to anyone talk about the tiny sound . learn how to put they in you ear , it make all the difference this be the case with all the micro earbud I have try , they must be seat in you ear properly .
Headphone	POS	4	I love anything by bose , but the price for these headphone be not mark down from the list price -lrb- the bose site have they list at the same price that Amazon consider `` discount '' -rrb-
Headphone	NEG	1	just after 3 month the on\/off button break down , shortly after the button lock feature stop work .  before this , when I put the unit in my coat pocket , at the slightest movment it would turn itself on , if the button lock be not on . so , if you be not consiencious enought to put the button lock on each time , expect to burn through a slew of battery .
Headphone	POS	5	I be not a headphone snob , I be just look for a great headphone at a good price . the cord be very nice and flexible and they come with a bunch of different ear adapter ... take the time to get the fit right . the fact that there be a case be great ... the fact that there be no winder or some way to constrain the cord in the case be a minus . but I do not expect to get a case ... so I can not downvote on a extra . the best bass I have ever experience in a in-ear headphone . tl ; dr buy they , they be good .
Headphone	POS	5	I be a keyboard player who have play in many record studio over the year and these headphone be the one I usually see . they be reasonably price and re-produce accurate sound rendering that represent the sound you actually hear with no add fluff . I would highly recommend these headphone to anyone who appreciate a good , solid piece of equipment that will last a long time .
Headphone	POS	5	I just order these from Amazon and receive they yesterday , they work great . battery take about the estimate time to charge , 16 hour . I hook they up to my tv and be able to listen from in front and off to each side a bit , even with the transmitter slightly obstruct by a speaker stand
Headphone	NEG	1	not a good product . difficult to keep tune to the television , and the battery would not stay in place . I would not purchase this product again .
Headphone	POS	5	I get two of these , the first with a great discount . but my brother like it so much , that I order a second set right after receive and test the headphone for some day . they be comfortable , quite light , and sound really great -lrb- I can not listen to videos\/music in youtube with these because it just do not make the headphone justice -rrb- . this be my first time buy `` brand '' headphone , and you can really hear the difference !
Headphone	POS	5	when I first open the box on this headset I think how cheap it feel . but after use it I be glad it be light . do not be fool , the Sennheiser quality be there . I be totally hooked on this headeset now ! I just wish the battery be cheaper and time will tell how long they really last . also still not sure why Amazon be sell additional headset for this setup at a higher price .
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be a very good value . they block noise very well , and the three earbud size should fit pretty much anyone . the sound be noticeably better than my fifteen-dollar set I have be use and I have find that I be able to pick out lyric or melody in some song that I have not notice before . the behind the head cord might annoy some but I be use to it and I find that it help the headphone from be tear from you ear or catch on thing . the headphone themselves be very small and sleek look . the packaging and shipping be my only complaint , as there be virtually no way to open the dang thing without a heavy duty scissors and a lot of effort . the shipping take a little longer than I would have like but that be not the fault of the headphone ! Sennheiser say that they come with a 2 year guarantee warranty , although I have no idea how this would work since I order they from a third-party . hopefully I will not need to figure this out . overall , a great value and I use they everyday . they be stylish , comfortable and sound great .
Headphone	POS	4	sound quality very good , noise isolation slighty better than original . they stay in place much better .
Headphone	POS	5	these be work fine for I . I can not believe how great the sound be . as to the bass , I just put these to the `` bass '' test . one of the most demand track , in my experience , be the song `` one '' by Metallica . you know that part just before Lars ' double bass kick in ? well , there be very few speaker that can handle that , especially with the volume and the low end bass turn up . I may have hear one pair of speaker in my life that could handle that part of the song without distortion , and those be 100 watt 3-way speaker with 15 '' woofer . well , I just listen to that part on these headphone with the volume up about as loud as I could stand , and with the low end of the equalizer turn up almost all the way , and guess what ? no distortion !? I still can not believe it , but I just hear it with my own ear . these thing really do go `` inside '' you ear ! in fact , I would say to be careful that you do not shove they in there too far , or too fast . and be careful pull they back out . you have only get 2 eardrum , so do not be reckless with they . to the person who complain about `` too much bass '' distort the audio , do not you mp3 player have some sort of equalizer ? I would think that almost any mp3 player would have at least a 5-band equalizer ? -lrb- as far as I be concerned , any mp3 player should have a 10-band equalizer , but I guess we can not have everything . -rrb- one complaint : there be no volume control build into the wire . I have buy much lesser headphone that do have that feature , and it be a shame that they do not include that feature on these , but , oh well . I see they be on sale now for $ 3 . oo !? wow , now that be amazing ! I think I be get a amazing bargain because I only pay $ 7 . oo for they !
Headphone	POS	5	these head phone be very nice and comfortable . the sound quality be great . when you first take they out of the package though they look like guitar head phone at the end , like they would plug into a amp . or something but you just take that off and it plug into anything else like a ipod .
Headphone	POS	5	I buy these for my son a he just love they , I put they on myself a they fit very well seem very sturdy a the sound be great . a as usual with Amazon you can expect fast ship a excellent packaging .
Headphone	NEG	1	delivery date be Dec 20 . no sign of it and no option to contact the seller on my account . help ?
Headphone	POS	4	the noise cancellation be not as good as bose . but it cost so much less and get you most of the way there . the audio quality be passable , as people have note it be much quieter with nc turn off but nothing that the volume control on you media device will not solve . I also do not have problem with noise leakage , in a office setting with workstation whir on desk , you can not make out sound at 1 foot from the headphone . you mileage may vary with ambient sound and volume of music .
Headphone	POS	4	i have to return these after one day because they be huge on the ear . there be no way to adjust the headband , so it keep fall off my head . i get irritated so i just return it . sound quality be pretty good , but i didnt have they long enough to say anything else about this .
Headphone	POS	5	this be my third pair . I love these . the price be great , the sound be also really good . when it come to ear bud , often time the bass be really lack . the bass in these be outstanding .
Headphone	NEG	2	when these in-ear headphone be properly install -lrb- and get they in right be like a installation -rrb- the sound be amazing . I have hear part of song that I would never hear before . but the headphone suffer from two massive flaw . the first be that if the headphone move the tiniest bit out of you ear canal , the sound quality plummet . this be a huge problem because the cord be so long that it be guarantee to catch on something and jiggle the earbud . even when wrap up and out of the way , the cord will respond to the slightest movement and pop the earbud out of you ear . this be extraordinarily frustrating , all the more so because the sound be so good . I do not recommend these headphone to active people or to people that plan on move much at all . if , however , you do not plan on move much with these headphone , you be golden . also note : that little case that come with they should be use all the time ; the earbud piece will come off in you bag or pocket and the case help prevent that . it also help prevent just whipping out you ipod and listening , since you have to undo the case and store it , but that be the least of you problem with these headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	these pone be a excellent value and have a great sound for listen to audiobook .
Headphone	POS	5	it be great especially for the price . I enjoy this earbud .
Headphone	POS	5	EMPTYSTRING
Headphone	POS	4	I be first introduce to what we now call the 71EX series by a good friend from Beijing who let I borrow hers : I fall in love and have to get a pair when I make my first trip to Japan . those be Fontopia N.U.D.E. ex70 series - soon to be replace by the 71ex with less clingy cord and more trim head -lrb- same driver\/innards -rrb- . in short - these bud be pretty awesome . since that first pair , I have own two other set -lrb- 3 total -rrb- , due to rain , a washer , and a washer\/dryer run respectively . here be a breakdown : - comfort : the top . Easy to sleep\/nap in - its entirely possible to forget you be wear they . still , inner-ear bud be not for everyone . if you be new to this style , give these a fair chance to get use to em ' before declare they uncomfy ; -rrb- . - isolation : Great . effective enough to avoid use these while driving\/cycling\/attending a lecture . very nice feature when try to take a nap or otherwise tuning out noisy surroundings . - Inexpensive ... certainly a plus as you will not break the bank if you break em ' or decide inner-ear bud be not right for you - sound quality : Fair mid , crisp high , and strong but somewhat muddly low -lrb- i.e. rapid bass drum hit will sound more like `` thummm-thummm '' than `` thmp ! thmp ! '' -rrb- . if I have to rate these on sound quality alone , I would probably give these 3\/5 star , but the above benefit bump it up higher , and be the reason I keep buy the same bud even after accidentally ruin they multiple time . in summary : a highly recommend introduction to the world of inner-ear bud . great way to try the style out without diving head-first with you wallet . for a step up in quality\/price , search amazon\/google for cx300 -lrb- ~ $ 30 -rrb- , ex85\/ex90 -lrb- ~ $ 60 -rrb- , V-Moda Vibe -lrb- ~ $ 75 -rrb- . also recommend study up at the ilounge headphone forum - invaluable resource for nonfanboy observation regard these and many other model .
Headphone	POS	5	it only be a month but so far so good . sound great and look very durable -lrb- a must as my headphone usually do not last long -rrb- . fantastic price especially as i have they ship to the UK . well worth it !
Headphone	NEU	3	this headphone have very good audio quality but after 5-10 minute it be very uncomfortable to wear . I be start to have headache on the side of my head above the ear after that time . I have have it for the past 12 month and now I dread wear it . I be 5 ' 9 '' with average size head . try this before you get this . it do not stretch with time .
Headphone	NEG	1	the sound be awesome for the short time they last . wire come away from ear bud .
Headphone	POS	4	just Super Sound come form this small device . I use it when I travel on the airplane and discover I do not need the bulky expensive noise cancel headphone . with the ear plug nicely place , all you hear be great sound , and its easy to carry around . definitely recommend it .
Headphone	NEG	2	no matter how the sound quality be , I think this headphone be very uncomfortable . I originally want to get the Boss oe2 , but go for this because it be much cheaper . but I do not like how it feel when I wear it .
Headphone	NEU	3	I have purchase this brand in the past and have be very happy with the sound and durability . I use these to listen to my mp3 player while work out and the fit be perfect . sadly , the connection from this pair to my player seem to create more static and the sound go in and out during listen . because they be so cheap , I do buy two pair and will switch to the other pair soon . hopefully , it be just a glitch in my current headphone and the other pair will function as other have in the past .
Headphone	NEG	1	the connect point where the hook go into the headphone be loose , so they do not stay in place very well . the sound quality be ok , but because it wont clamp onto the ear well enough I lose a lot of sound definition which make it sound pretty crappy overall . my primary problem with headphone be the cord that connect to the mp3 player stop work because it rip at the base of the plug . I buy these about 3 month ago and the where the cord connect to the metal plug have completely come undo . I think it may be because I wrap my headphone around my mp3 player before I put it in my pocket . but nonetheless , this cord do not last near as long as some of the cheaper headphone I have purchase .
Headphone	POS	5	these headphone be perfect . they fit in my ear , block out other sound in the room and they stay in place when I turn my head . -lrb- my other ear bud keep fall out . -rrb- and the sound be excellent . I can hear every instrument and every word ; so clearly that I now realize some lyric I be sing incorrectly all these year . would definitely recommend these to friend .
Headphone	POS	4	the review from some people on this site have I concern that upon use my new headphone , the cable would turn to jelly and the product would become worthless . that have not happen yet , and I be loving these headphone . they block noise out with the snug fit , and they sound great . I enjoy listen to all type of music , especially track with intricate , bass heavy beat , like those of Kanye West , for example . I be hold onto my warranty , which I believe be 2 month . so far , so good .
Headphone	POS	4	really good investment . they work extremely well , do not hurt my ear , and I do not have to pay too much . if the price seem to good to be true , trust I , it be a good deal . I get it within a week , and I have have it 3 week now . no problem .
Headphone	NEG	2	I have to turn these thing forward at a 45 degree angle from how they be picture to make they hold on to my ear . otherwise the bud do not even rest in place . the audio quality seem fine . before I use they regularly , I just have to decide whether I feel ridiculous go out in public with these thing \* look \* like they be fall out , as it be the only way to actually keep they from do so .
Headphone	POS	4	I get this headphone about 1month ago . just 99 $ , it be a good deal , but it doesnt work good with mp3 player or ipod , you need a headamp for this headphone . when i use with home theater system , it easy to drive this headphone . this headphone make treble so good , mid be ok , and bass be very strong . THIS be a good deal for 99 $ , but you need a headamp to drive it
Headphone	POS	4	the ar Wireless Headphones have good reception thoughout my house . it do start to get some static in my back yard and in my garage but other than that it work good . the headphone do fit comfortably on my head , they also block out most of the background noise .
Headphone	NEU	3	I buy my Triport headphone nearly a year ago , and mine have hold up well , but I have have to be \* very \* careful when I handle they . the sound quality really be teriffic -- excellent frequency response across the entire spectrum , with a `` warmth '' in the bass that be miss in every other set of headphon I have -lrb- admittedly , none of my other headphone cost as much as the Triport -rrb- . in general , these headphone be comfortable to wear , and the foam rim around the phone mold to you head , do a great job of block outside sound . at time , the thin headband become uncomfortable ; I find I can wear these thing for about a hour before the top of my head become sore from the pressure of the hard , narrow headband . as other here have point out , the construction of these thing be extremely shoddy . they look and feel like a $ 10 pair you might pick up at Family Dollar . the cord be dangerously thin , as be the headband . these be definitely not heavy-duty headphone . the connection where the headphone cup connect to the headband be begin to crack on mine -- it be only a matter of time before they 'll need tape reinforcement . because they be so flimsy , I never take mine out of the house . when I want to listen to something walking , jogging , or otherwise `` on the move , '' I take my sturdier Sony headphone , even though the sound be poorer . I use the Triports mainly for listen to music or movie at home when I do not want to disturb other in the house -- for that they do a decent job . it be a shame that for what these cost , they could not be better make . if you be prepare to spend this much for a good set of headphone , think twice before buy this set . for the same price , there must be better-built , decent sound headphone out there .
Headphone	POS	5	I write computer hardware review for devhardware.com and I have the pleasure of write up a full review on these headphone which can be find at http:\/\/www.devhardware.com\/c\/a\/speakers\/sennheiser-px100\/ needless to say they be definitely worth the money . for less than $ 40 you will not find a better sound set of phone .
Headphone	POS	4	this be a good product for the price offer . although many people do not use these type of headphone anymore , I believe this be a good choice for use at home . I tend to have problem with the earbud be too big or constantly fall out , but these headphone be good to go when you hood they on you head !
Headphone	POS	5	sound quality be quite good consider the item 's low price , bass come through great and the headphone only fault be show when music be at a very high frequency for a long period of time . the cord actually do prevent tangle , be a decent length , do not hinder music when rub against clothing , and look good . the purchase also include a great compact carry case which hold several size of ear bud -lrb- 5 pair in total -rrb- . once the proper seal around you ear have be make these headphone will sound great and provide a amazing value for all sort of buyer highly recommend .
Headphone	POS	5	I have a hard time with headphone . these be great - there be a plethora of option for the ear bud portion and the over the ear part be mold-able ensure that they stay on you ear regardless of the shape and activity . if only they be waterproof .
Headphone	POS	4	my wife love these headphone . I have work in loud environment my whole life , so my hearing be not as good as hers . she use to constantly complain that I have the tv , or music too loud . while sometimes I would use a cord headphone , it be too constrict . the sound quality of this set of cordless headphone be on par with the high end cord headphone I own -lrb- bose -rrb- . while I do not get the range that other seem to get , I enjoy be able to get up and move around without be tethered to a cord . I be not a audiophile , but I do enjoy my music and will not tolerate hiss etc. . my wife have use these several time and want to know when I be get she a set . well I finally order she a set . I hope that be able to use the one docking station will be easy to pair the second set with . will update when second set arrive on ease of use to set with one docking station .
Headphone	POS	4	the sound of the equipment be excellent . Controls be not easy , too small . if I bow the headphone will not hold in place . refer to the Sennheiser Wireless headphone r 120 pURCHASED THRU AMAZON
Headphone	POS	5	this be a damned good set of earbud for the price . good sound with decent amount of bass ... moldable to you ear . you really can not beat this thing . under $ 20 ?? come on . . buy it already !
Headphone	POS	5	just get these today , but I shop around for some time , I have the Studio beat for a couple of week , and decide they be not worth the price . . these go well , for the average audiophile . . if you be look for some durable , good look , and good perform headphone , that be comfortable . . there be no better choice ... I really hope v-moda continue make product of this caliber , as I be very impressed with the pair I have ... and they be not overprice . . if you have a need for headphone and have a extra 100-200 buck to spend . . get THESE , you wont be DISAPPOINTED .
Headphone	POS	5	I purchase these headphone to use while work out because I be tire of the ear bud that come with my ipod and other cheap ear bud fall out of my ear . these be amazingly comfortable and be very secure in the ear . as soon as I put they in I be very impressed . it be easy to figure out how they go in the ear and easy to change the provide tip to find the right size . there be also a small clip on the cable so I can clip the cable to my clothes so it do not bounce around during the workout . the sound quality be a amazing upgrade compare to the headphone I have be use but I be compare they to very cheap headphone . this be my first pair of nice headphone ever so I be not able to provide a comparison to other brand . I be concern about they durability , base on some other review , so I will update my review in a few month .
Headphone	POS	5	I never realize how much a pair of better earbud could do for the quality of music . Bass be full and clear and I can hear thing I never hear before use the earbud that come with the ipod nano . great buy for the price .
Headphone	POS	4	when I get these first , they be excellent ! Philips have not let I down before . the sound be rich with great bass , but I will say that they hurt my ear for about a week . after that I get use to the feel of they . as for durability , they last about a year , now there be only one phone working . of course , if I fiddle with the wire I can get both work , but I can not bring they anywhere anymore . I really do like these though , so its a pity .
Headphone	NEU	3	these earbud look awesome , but they will not stay in you ear very well . I buy the earbud for my wife and she say they be too heavy and when she move a little bit they just fall out . she have try the different size of ear piece it come with and none will hold they in . if the earbud would stay in I would give this product a 5 - star rating due to the fact that when she do not move , they stay in , and sound great .
Headphone	NEG	2	someone give I a cheap pair of noise cancel headphone from Radio Shack , and I figure I could do better , so I buy these JVC headphone . the retractable cord be a big selling point , and I do like that feature a lot , although it be very hard to find the switch when you be ready to retract the cord . I also want smaller earphone , and several people mention these be good for smaller ear -lrb- which mine be -rrb- . I find these to be very uncomfortable . they be bigger and clunkier than the Radio Shack headset I have , and they be really tight . they really pin my outer ear down -- I could not find a way to adjust they that make they feel any better . the noise reduction feature do work pretty well . no complaint about that . I play a dvd on the plane and could hear even the softest dialogue just fine -lrb- with the volume turn all the way up -rrb- . however , they be not significantly better than my cheaper headphone in that regard . because of the discomfort and overall `` clunkiness , '' I be return these headphone .
Headphone	POS	5	as a Headphone nut , I find these great for a reasonable price . a little bit of static occasionally as with all cordless headphone . these be comfortable and not too hot for longer use .
Headphone	POS	5	Wheeeeee . have be enjoy the v80 since two week . love they , love they !!! so happy they finally arrive and be able to try they out . the senn hd 598 be my first decent over ear headphone and I think they be the best until I get the v - moda . I do not know what exactly cause the great sound -lrb- the dual driver maybe ? -rrb- because otherwise it kind of go against logic -lrb- cause the senn have bigger driver -rrb- but the v-moda 's sound clearer to I : s. I also have the akg k 701 for at home and yeah , those be more analytic\/detailed and be also very dreamworthy still , but the bass on the v-moda kick they ass any day . and when I compare all three , the senn somehow lose badly , it sound the loudest\/muddiest and bassiest -lrb- but in the bad way -rrb- of all . before I have the means to compare , it be not that obvious !! I think the 598 be the cat 's ass . anyway , the v moda be the ultimate portable solution , even though they be on ear they do get comfy after a while after adjust to you ears\/head a bit , I be surprised -lrb- have a not fully heal industrial pierce on the right I be fear the clamp -rrb- , but I be very happy with that , I do feel it , but it be not really a pain in the ass . in conclusion : the headphone sound great , even better than I expect after read all the review . no tinny cavern sound as I read somewhere but a big ! clear moderately bassy sound , and the treble be not very pronounced but I like that , since modest treble be less fatiguing\/head-ache induce . as for the look : I must say the fact that they do not look huge and be very very pretty + true blood edition -lrb- oh yes yes -rrb- also be reason to buy . when they arrive somehow the look dissappoint I though , but only a bit , because the picture build up impossible expectation haha and I think it have something to do with the chord be a bit flimsy -lrb- in comparison to big headphone - not to other portable -rrb- and the gray black not fitting the red of the v 80 completely . still , I have get over it . they somehow look very steampunk\/similar to advanced technological artefact from the past . they be very beautiful in they own punk way though and fit small head . anyway : aesthetics : subjective and de gustibus ... I do like they a lot , the earcup be ideal , the headband maybe could still improve as far as look be consider , comfort be ok . as for the customize : I would love to , but very impractical since buying\/sending from USA to EU mostly give grief . Customs tend to keep stuff + extra shipping cost . any belgian ppl here order custom shield ? I would love to hear if it go well or not ? oh , also why do not the eternal life warranty include the EU ? : -lrb- . so sad . anyway . if the m-100 will sound even greater , consider another body turn . I also hope that the v-moda will hit the european market in retail shop too ... will they be available in Europe ?? so we can look and try it out maybe instead of have to rely on internet buying ? I would do it either way , but my preference go to be able to try it out ! Afterthought : no burning in effect imo . second afterthought : venus vidi vici be total win . Latin -lrb- 3 .
Headphone	NEG	1	I run . I sweat . I be not be pay by Philips corporate headquarters to write this review . I too have spend somewhere in the hundred try to find that perfect , do not slide out of my ear after a mile , with good sound quality headphone . well sadly enough , these be not it . the sound be embarrassing -lrb- which be not why I buy they -rrb- , the headphone start to slide as soon as you be ready to run some distance , and you might be think : how do a pair of headphone slide when they be ear clip on ? low and behold , this set have manage to do so . and once they have start to slip , it be over ... it be all over . in my experience , there be no way to get they comfortably back on , even if you have dry they . the sound be even worse than before if I even bother to dry they mid-run , they wont fit snug again in my ear if they have to be take off mid-run , and they have this ridiculously long cord , long enough to hang myself out of frustration . I always know Philips make crap electronics , but I be willing to try anything , I have about ten or fifteen pair and they be all lame . the best pair I have have , have be a Sony pair , that be not even sport edition , or waterproof , or anything -lrb- they be however expensive -rrb- . if you be consider buy this product , I would keep look , there be better choice out there , although more expensive ... consider what you will spend on this pair and then another pair , and spend about that amount to begin with . or just by a pair of cheapo Skull candy headphone , they be about as sport friendly as these . good luck . sorry philip , I have to tell the truth .
Headphone	POS	5	First off I would like to say that these headphone have amazing sound and construction quality , also the comfort be suprisingly good . lastly I have a question about the break in period . do I have to play the headphone at a low volume to break they in ?
Headphone	POS	4	the sound these put out be nearly unimpeachable . I be use they with a Ray Samuels Audio Predator usb dac\/headphone amp , source by a modify HP Tablet PC -lrb- usb -rrb- and a ASUS Transformer Prime -lrb- analog out -rrb- and get good result . the sound be relax , detail natural , although I think the high be a bit roll off . I would not use these straight out of a low power source . I do have a couple of con - first , as some other reviewer have point out the attachment of the can to the headband seem flimsy - it do result in unsurpassed comfort for a headphone this large . the finish on the mahogany earcup be less than superb . the cord be long and heavy and make the phone unsuitable for portable use and less than optimum even in home with a ipod or tablet - they be design for use with a headphone amp , a control amp\/processor or receiver . as the headline for the review note , these be make in China , which be a disappointment when buy a luxury grade product from a japanese manufacturer . give my experience with the limited lifespan of most chinese make electronics , I wonder what they longevity will be . if I have pay full price for these they would be go back . I do have to say kudos to Amazon for a great price and fast prime delivery .
Headphone	POS	5	I buy these headphone after read the review and the good rating . all I can say be these headphone be probably the best headphone I have ever own . the sound be phenomenal . I sometime use they for watch movie on my laptop the sound be so good it sound as if I be at the theater . music the high , mid , low come through very well . for the price you cant beat it . these headphone can go for much more than what they cost .
