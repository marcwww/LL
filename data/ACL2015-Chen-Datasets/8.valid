Projector	NEG	2	this be absolutely not a fit for Optoma hd20 . I do not know how it fit other projector , but if you have hd20 look somewhere else . the mount assembly be too big for the tiny optoma and it be too hard to fit it in . if you try the centroid method the manual suggest , its nearly impossible to align the hole to match . once you put it together and mount it on the ceiling , it will still have some tiny wobble and adjust to fit the screen be quite a task . tighten the bolt do not really help so much . the only good thing be that the piece that attach to the ceiling be very strong and well build . in general , remember to loosen the bolt before hoist it on the ceiling . you will have to oil the bolt and put a lot of strength to loosen they . they be terribly tight . Stay away from it if you have a hd20 !
Projector	POS	4	I see this pj in action last night . the source be a Sony BluRay dvd player and a br press of Spiderman 2 . the picture clarity be amazing . Rock solid image with -lrb- not surprisingly -rrb- incredible definition . I can not , however give it 5 star . perhaps the color calibration be not perfect -lrb- altough Sony rep be on hand so `` they bad '' if they set it up poorly -rrb- - in particular the red be far too prominent . this be a 3 chip , native 1920x1080 unit , so no color wheel and , hence , no rainbow effect . it also run super quiet -lrb- again , no wheel -rrb- and push surprisingly little air out of the read-ported vent . the air that be come out \* be \* pretty hot , so any room that host this bad boy should have good ventilation . it be a attractive unit and , steal from Apple , the `` sony '' logo be rear-lit when the unit be turn on . the screen be a pretty small Stewart Filmscreens Greyhawk , so contrast ratio be additionally boost . due to the small size , the image be exceptionally bright . at this resolution , it be interesting to note how clearly computer generate the Spiderman scene appear . on sd unit , there be enough softening of the edge to hide the cg nature of the image and complete the illusion . at hidef re , however , the blue-screen and cg become quite obvious . Hollywood Actors\/Actresses : beware ! you wrinkle and blemish will soon be splash they way across 120 '' hidef screen all over the world ! : -rrb- at under $ 9k for a 3-chip dlp , Sony have really throw down the gauntlet with this one . expect competitor to follow and hopefully we 'll all be able to afford something of this spec within just a few more year .
Projector	POS	5	wow this thing be fantastic !!! I love it !!! just get do watch the supper bowel with Family and freind in my man cave , the projector exceed my expectation ! wife and I also watch a movie on it last night . you cant go wrong for the price !
Projector	NEU	3	I be finally able to get the projector work with my MacBook -lrb- run Lion -rrb- after the support team send I the latest driver for the usb link . this process be quite frustrating yet I must say the fix work the first time . overall ok for customer service . pro : - display be very bright - the ability to adjust color be important as well and intuitive . - menu be simple and intuitive . - once customer support be actually engage , it work well . con : - I have a great deal of difficulty with initial installation with my MAC - despite the claim of ` it work right out of the box ' it do not . os x Lion have be out for over a year - why be they ship with a old driver ? - video playback for YouTube and DV file from my hard drive be choppy . the frame rate support by the projector be far from ideal . I find it quite noticeable . when I look at the computer screen the playback remain clear and chop-free . not sure what the issue be here , but this be a definite detractor . I need to test with a dvd and see if this be true for that as well . I will update when that test be complete . Update on pay a dvd from my MacBook : the dvd screen be a mass of gray and white square - no picture of the movie at all . I email customer support for assistance . - customer support get right back to I - which be great , but the the advice be to use the VGA cable to fix the issue I have . this show a basic lack of understanding of my system . MacBook do not support VGA cable , so they advice be useless . - customer support once again reply a couple of day later and advise I to purchase a adapter for the VGA cable to ensure that dvd playback on the MacBook would function properly . once again , I find this a less than desirable solution . it be not like mac be ` strange ' - VGA be old technology , it be time to update people ! I be reduce my review to three-stars base on this experience . overall - for the price - a very solid projector for business application . I can not recommend it at this point for entertainment application as the video playback be simply not up to par .
Projector	POS	5	nice picture size over 8 foot so be prepare for large work area need to enjoy the full view , all , connect be secure simple set up and operation .
Projector	POS	5	excellent project with enough brightness in the room with window . all function be work well as describe by Panasonic . Lighting remote control be helpful in dark room . it be definitely worth $ $ $ $ you pay for this project .
Projector	POS	5	I buy the hc4000 as a replacement for it be older brother hc3800 -lrb- damage in a lightning strike -rrb- ... the family line have a good gene pool - super price\/performance value
Projector	POS	4	very good Projector . have it for a month now and very happy with it . have a little problem in the begin to set it up with nvida 3d vision on my pc -lrb- mostly because of my lack of experience in the area -rrb- but manage to do it after 4 day . only down side be the beep noise when turn on and of and the fact that the on screen menu have no option to be more transparent . January 02 2012 : have it for almost a year now and still work fine
Projector	POS	5	we make a outdoor entertainment area at the back end of we property where two very large tree fall and form a natural amphitheater . on a Tori gate between the two tree , I mount a seven foot screen so we could watch movie use a projection system I buy from Amazon and a extra stereo receiver and surround sound system . it be great but the screen be just not big enough for the area so I purchase this ten foot one . WOW , what a difference . we have have four movie night so far and everybody want to come . I want a manual , pull down , screen because I have to take it down and store it after every movie . this one seem to be well make . it pull down and raise very easily . I use a blu-ray player to show the movie and the picture be as least as good as the big screen tv in the house . -lrb- it be about four year old -rrb- Phoenix be warm enough to have movie night all winter long , with a fire pit anyway . spring and fall be absolutely perfect ... during July through September , I be go to have to figure a way to mount it so we can watch movie from the pool .
Projector	POS	5	OMG !!!! that be all I can say ! this be the best projector I have ever use ! I be a teacher and where I teach , they use the Epilson . it be a great projector but very pricely . I have read all of the other review because I be skepitical about buy a product without ue a demonstration . this projector be not only affordable but be great ! I laugh at the comment that say if you do not like high quality brightness -lrb- or something like that -rrb- this be not for you . well he be right ! this projector be so bright and colorful that you can watch it with the light on . it just need minor adjustment . I be soooooo glad I do not purchase a flat screen television or a big screen television . it be such a waste of money . I still have mine from 10 year ago that still work great . I do not use it now . I connect the Vivitek to my cable wire and watch cable tv , it be connect to my dvd player for movie , and I highly recommend it for the new Xbox kinect usage !!! awesome !!!!!!!!! the only problem be ... it get hot and the fan can be loud for a short period of time . if you have the stereo surround system , then do not worry , the volume will override the noise . that be it !!! buy it and enjoy it !
Projector	POS	5	I purchase this mount after read the review for use this mount with a Epson 8350 . I take the advice of other in order to locate the balance point of the mount . also , like other , I be only able to use 3 of the 5 mount hole . however , I be able to mount the projector and it work very well . it take a little adjust to get it level and solid but I be able to do it . I do want to use all 5 mount as I want to be sure the projector be securely hold . I find the Atdec website and send a message to customer service ask how I would go about purchase two additional long extension . I be very pleasantly surprise when the customer service representative reply that he would send they to I no charge if I would provide my address . now that be outstanding customer service !!!! highly recommend this mount !
Projector	NEG	1	this be only a very basic item and not intend for use to project for even medium size audience . the light be very weak and have difficulty project much further than 8 foot .
Projector	POS	5	very sturdy and solid construction . mount to a Dell 2400 projector be a little bit tricky because the projector only have one hole and I think this mount be for three hole . anyway , I figure it out and now it just sit there hold up the projector . the wall mount screw be a bit long - I use some shorter one that work better . I be happy with this product and would buy it again .
Projector	POS	5	I use this for movie night outside on a 9 ` x16 ' screen make out of blackout cloth purchase on here from Carl 's place . you would be about 27 ' from the screen and the color and clarity through my blu-ray player be UNBELIVEABLE . there be no overheating or blur like other have say . I use a 720p Vivitek projector and this one blow it away . you will not be disappoint . the on board speaker be ok but I hook up my own surround sound . buy with confidence .
Projector	NEG	1	install the bulb and when I turn on the video I be disappointed beam illuminate very little , I do not recommend this bulb , never ever buy .
Projector	NEG	1	too bad the excellent electronics and picture be totally cancel out by a bulb that do not last as advertise . Epson tout 4000 hour lamp life , but it be a BIG lie ! first bulb last 660 hour , die after the 90 day warranty on the bulb , but be replace under a secret extension to the warranty by Epson . second bulb last 700 hour , but the overall 2 year warranty be up , so tough luck . so , two bulb , 25 month of service , 1360 hour . you need to figure a new $ 270 bulb for each year of life when you calculate the cost to operate this pj .
Projector	POS	4	I buy this as a Christmas present for my husband who love electronics . Use will be for gaming with the Wii -lrb- until we kid we older and he get that PS3 or XBox he want -rrb- , and movie blue-ray\/dvd watch purpose . my kid be thrill with the idea of a `` movie theater '' in we game room . I be impress with the picture for the price I pay , and no , it be not hd , but it be pretty cool if you ask I -lrb- as a electronics novice -rrb- . he say , great picture , very bright . some difficulty in find the component to VGA cable - it must be order off the internet . right now , he be just use what come with , and be still fairly happy with it . Picture be pretty clear even with three window in we game room - even better in the dark\/at night . we be very pleased with the product , for the price . he have no idea what I pay for it , but seem very impressed . rate lower ease of set up due to find cable , etc. but if you know ahead of time what to order , you should be fine .
Projector	POS	5	this product give many different option of installation it be simple and easy to install . I be very happy with the quality . thanks , Avi Moyal http:\/\/www.kabbalah.info
Projector	POS	4	I be pleasantly surprise at this unit . it be not perfect , but for what it be it be great . first , the picture , and most important part of this unit . the picture be great . sure it be not as god as a big display unit , but for its compact size it work great . unfortunately there be not any picture control that I could find except for focus , so the picture you get be what you get . color be a little dull , but that might have to do with the darkness in the room too . it also have a build in speaker which be not the loudest , but better than nothing . you can always connect external speaker . the focus dial be great and I be able ego get the image very crisp at a large size , and smaller one . the unit itself be very light . definitely build for on the go . it have a little pop out stand that really do not raise the unit much and be almost useless . the include tripod be much better and work great once you get the leg at the right angle . the lack of extra feature make it very easy to use with on\/off\/volume controls\/focus , and that be about it . it do get warm pretty fast so you do want to use the tripod . it come with a bunch of accessory include outlet for various plug type , video cable , a case . you can use the VGA cable to connect you computer which also have a audio plug connect to it , so no need to have a separate cable . I also try the iPod\/iPad connector and it work fantastic . I be even able to play purchase video from iTunes , which I do not expect . I be not sure if every model come with the connector or if it be a extra buy on . while this unit be pricey , it be cheaper than a full size unit and definitely perfect for the person on the go with the light weight . this really be a nice unit .
Projector	POS	4	I hide this screen in my crown molding and it work great . it keep the wall clean for artwork . Easy to install and remote work well too . overall exceptional product for the price . the only issue I have be the screen be make for 9 ' ceiling and I have a 12 ' ceiling . I be still try to figure out how to lower the screen 3 more foot . I might even have to find another screen that roll down longer . I welcome any suggestion . I be not afraid to void the warranty on this product . overall you can not beat the price for what you get .
Projector	NEG	1	I do not know if the problem be with the accessory kit or my projector , but I still have problem get my Iphone 4 to work with my Optoma projector .
Projector	NEG	2	basic construction and design leave a lot to be desire . do not fit larger projector use in most media room today .
Projector	POS	5	this product be perfect for someone that travel a lot to meeting and seminar . it be light weight , compact and provide for projection of multiple component .
Projector	POS	5	I be very satisfied with this purchase . product be a good value and arrive in excellent condition . I review many brand and model and select the Epson 705HD base on performance and budget . anything better would have be twice the price . my family and I be enjoy movie on the big screen .
Projector	NEG	2	order this projector after read good review here and elsewhere . initially I be quite impressed by the image quality , very decent 720p image that match my expectaion . however , about 9 month into use , the projector start develop bad pixel . I make the obviouse mistake of not return it on the spot for a in-warranty repair . initially just a few ... but the situation deteriorate over time . I be now about 18 month from first use and the device be unusable ; there be over 100 bad pixel -lrb- mostly white -rrb- plus a `` bad '' black line run across at about 2\/3 the screen . obviously there be something significantly wrong with the reliability of the dlp device use in this design ... I have contact customer support ... look forward to they reply . Update May-31-12 : have return the unit to Optoma for repair - they gracefully accept this as a `` in warranty repair '' even though technically out of the guarantee 12-month period . good expereince ... make I comfortable of purchase optoma product in the future .
Projector	POS	4	I recently purchase the Sony vlphw30ae -lrb- vlphw30 series 3d with transmitter and 2 pair of 3d glass -rrb- . as a previous owner of a Sony vplvw60 1080p 24 frame projector I have high video standard and expectation . this be say , I be not sure what to expect give the lower price point and how a 3d optimize picture would stack up in 2d mode . I be quite impressed with the fast start up time and the very deep black level of the vlphw30ae . the manual zoom and focus take some get use to but work fine . the 3d pictue on this relatively low cost projector be quite impressive , very bright and detailed with super deep black level . 2d detail for 1080p 24 frame fall a little short compare to the vplvw60 but not by much , give the vplvw60 be twice the price and 50 % heavier I be not disappoint . the remote backlight work great , all advance function be there . still try to figure out the best cinema mode , the low lamp mode be plenty bright for my need . I rate this high , 8.5 ~ 9.0 out of 10 the Amazon service and shipping time be great , well packed and with all the accessory !
Projector	POS	5	Universal , easy to install and quite stable . install last year , it move about 1 inch in one year , so I adjust it in one second . actually it could be my home that move ... it be the best quality \/ price item that I could find and I be very happy I buy it instead of have the projector at reach for the kid .
Projector	POS	5	be perfect for my projector it come with all the tool need i love it thanks
Projector	POS	5	yes , you need a dark room and white backdrop , but it be awesome . i put this in my bedroom hook up to Dish and to my computer . i play blu ray through it from my pc on arcsoft tmt or powerdvd and it look great . you have to put it on video mode and it will look good . i have it at about 140 '' and it look great . i have 7.1 audio and that with this projector play a bd make my room feel like a personal cinema . dark movie like harry potter 7 part one look fine but you must adjust the lighting in TMT to get it bright enough to see everything . it be very good for only be 170 buck . it be all i need to have for now , i love it . plus like i say , it hook up to my dish tv so i watch tv on it and it be better by far than my tv . I would say if you want a big screen and dont want to waste a thousand buck on a full hd lead flatscreen get this for a 170 buck and have a 140 '' screen everyone will love !!!
Projector	NEG	2	I wish I have see the `` costly mistake '' review before I buy my 8100 in Feb. . I , too see the concern about `` beta '' unit , and discount they . well , I be initially a very satisfied buyer . this be the second projector I have own , the first be a Panasonic 720P pt ax200u . the 8100 be a big improvement over that one in picture quality , perceive brightness , etc. , as it should be , be several year newer technology and 1080p resolution . for 600 hour and 5 month , I be happy . then all of a sudden , the bulb severely dim . I spend the next 5 minute check various setting , hope to make this go away so we can finish watch the movie we be streaming from Amazon , then POP -lrb- loud -rrb- go my bulb , like the old-school flashbulb of yore , scare the \* ^ -lrb- \* ^ out of I and my wife . the next day , I check my warranty information , and discover that the advertised 4000 hour bulb be only warranteed for 90 day . my bad , should have read the fine print . I go online and find out that I be not alone , other have be experience this same kind of premature failure , and there be hint that Epson be `` extend '' the 90 day in the interest of customer service . so , I try the Epson `` direct customer line '' card provide with my projector , only to find the pin the supply on the card be not valid . ok , I spend my dime and call the support toll number . I describe my problem to the 1st level support specialist , and he instantly transfer I to a `` projector bulb specialist '' who take my info . and with no argument agree to send I a replacement bulb , after walk I through the extraction procedure -lrb- little bit of glass rain down on I in the process , as it be ceiling mount -rrb- . ok , I say , I be a satisfied customer , but kind of worried about the next bulb 's life . three day later , the bulb arrive , it be the WRONG one . I call support , same drill , this time they keep I on the hold for a long time , then transfer I to a `` customer relation '' specialist . she proceed to tell I that Epson policy be that they can not send I the correct replacement until they receive the wrong one back , and that I can not return it until they send I a return label . I say , wait a minute , this be you fault , not mine , I be not happy about this , my projector will be down a week , be not there someone who can authorize a expedited replacement , you can take my credit card # for security ? no , she say , due to the value of the bulb , it be company policy , and that be that . five day later , I finally get the return label , which be send regular US Mail , and it be for regular ground shipment , not even expedite . take 3 more day for they to get it , and then they do Fedex Next Day the replacement , but after the cutoff , so I finally get the replacement more than two week after the failure . it work so far , but who know how long it will last , or if they 'll replace another one after more time . have to be without live room entertainment for 2 week , and deal with service that do not care about customer satisfaction or even get the part #s right be not that entertaining , either . probably the last Epson product I 'll ever buy . my 3 1\/2 year old Panasonic projector be still go strong , install elsewhere , on it be first bulb , after 3000 hour , ironically .
Projector	NEG	1	try to use this projector this week to put a slideshow onto a wall at a trade show . turn off all spot light in the stand and the hall be not very brightly light ; even so , most of the slide be not readable as the projector be just too weak of a output . not suitable for this application . it might work in a totally dark room but be not usable when there be even a small amount of ambient light .
Projector	POS	5	thank you ... thank you SONY , really I could not believe my eye , it be a theater yes ... when I turn off the light the picture i have see be great . . the sharpness look like a 3d , it do not matter if you see the movie on the wall or on screen . this product be wonderfull , thanks to SONY the one and the only .
Projector	POS	5	just get this unit have be use a infocus x1 follow that up with a x2 but still miss the clarity and color I want in satellite tv viewing as well as dvd and VCR view . the optoma 719 upgrade my x2 from 800 x 600 up to a eye pop 780P\/1024 x 768 resolution that be nothing less than spectacular video viewing . I use a flat wall surface prepared and paint with `` Screen Goo '' -lrb- tm -rrb- and that be it . the room be light by one 25 watt -lrb- fridge -rrb- light bulb , provide plenty of light to still move around in a room area roughly 14 ' x 25 ' located in a basement area with window block . this be better than the movie theater . the color and clarity , resoultion of this projector with the new Texas Instruments DLP dark chip 2 be incredible for the same price as a much lesser resolution x1 or x2 from InFocus . do not get I wrong I really enjoy my x2 projector and it be great for gaming but for the serious dvd\/tv in hd viewer you can not do much better than this . contrast ration be fantastic as well as amount of lumen for the buck . the thing be so light weight that I be timid take it out of the box . this be a great bargin in a time when auto fuel be a king ' ransom .
Projector	POS	5	Easy to install : I use two white metal chain link -lrb- about 1 1\/2 '' long heavy link -rrb- on each side , pass through the mount hole . then I use two white ceiling hook , place at the proper diatance , one for each side . I buy they at Lowe 's and they be specially easy to use , as you do not have to drill any hole or look for stud , just screw they into the ceiling plaster and they anchor themselves and support up to 60 lb each . next I hang the two chain link to the hook on each side and the work be do -rrb- . it take I several hour to think about this way of do it , but only 10 minute to install it . the screen be great and function well . I have and Epson 8500 UB and it be picture perfect .
Projector	POS	5	I love my Epson Powerlite s1 . I use it regularly for PowerPoint presentation in office setting and as a big screen tv in we home theater . for PowerPoint it do a tremendous job , provide clean , crisp image . for home theater the room can not be too bright in order to see all of the detail , but that be a small concession to make for a projector that offer ease of use , very good quality , affordable replacement bulb price , and enough power to get the job do - all for under $ 1000 . very tough to beat this deal !
Projector	POS	4	very good quality and value for money fifa10 be a pleasure to watch sometime rainbow effect be visible
Projector	POS	5	I will say this without any hesitation , I have not have a single problem with my projector and I have have it for 6 year . when I see so many people say they have bulb problem , I can not help but to think that they must be turn the projector off without allow it to cool . at the moment , I be at 2943 hour and I have have no issue what so ever . I allow the fan to cool the bulb before I turn it off . that be so crucial . the picture quality be great , especially in hd . I will not say it be as clean as a plasma screen tv , but if you have the space , you can have a screen that be big as any wall in you house . I build a screen that be 77 inch . the picture be stunning . the fan fade to the back as you be watch . it be quiet enough to forget it be on when you be watch a movie . the only issue I have with the projector be that the connection be odd . you have to find a 16 pin cable that connect to the rbg rca cable to connect to the dvd . most store do not carry these but you can find they on ebay . just for the record , this projector be great in my book . just follow the instruction in order to maintain the life of you bulb and you will be fine .
Projector	POS	5	this be a great buy for this quality . I have this setup in the basement with a 100 '' screen . wow what a difference especially with blu-ray movie . hd football be also super ! the position option allow lot of different placement and it be very quiet . this be the first piece of technology that have ever impressed my wife ! it be that good .
Projector	NEG	1	purchase this projector to use for a small project room setting . need to project power point presentation . the image be small and very blur . even the basic title page of the presentation be blurry . I return the projector and my search continue .
Projector	POS	4	I be worry when I read the review for this product . I own a Epson Home Cinema 8350 , after search a bit I find the extension piece -lrb- that should come with this mount , but it do not -rrb- :  VideoSecu White Projector mount extension adaptor only for brand VideoSecu Projector Mount W53  the 2 rod will not reach the right 2 hole . I purchase only 1 extra extension and it fit perfectly along with the 3 other rod in a 1 center , 2 leave , 1 right configuration . if you want a 2 left , 2 right configuration for the screw , I recommend buy two extension . either way make it quite stable . so far so good with the ceiling mount . it say it can hold up to 44lb . the 8350 be only 16lb , so we will see how it hold out . assembly be simple , need a philip screwdriver -lrb- not include -rrb- , and a Alan wrench -lrb- include -rrb- . good buy .
Projector	POS	5	just have to order my first replacement bulb for the 8100 , get 1750 hour out of it and have have no other issue whatsoever . as I be check for replacement bulb on Amazon I think I would check on the review for this projector and be surprise to find out about all the problem people have , especially with the bulb . I buy the unit in November of 09 -lrb- previously own a Panasonic -rrb- and have use it almost daily since then . set up be in the basement , good airflow , room temperature year round at about 68 degree . I clean the filter monthly , have not touch the fan yet , run in ECO mode at all time . under these condition I have have zero issue with the unit , and even though I actually feel that 1750 hour be a bit low -lrb- I get 2500 hour on the Panasonic -rrb- , see the complaint on here I guess I can count myself lucky . I would also mention that no one can ever seriously expect the hour on a lamp that a manufacturer estimate , 4000 hour be practically impossible to achieve , but I do expect around 2500 hour or so . have say that , I be overall extremely happy with the product and be wait for the replacement bulb to arrive soon . if any other issue arise , I will update .
Projector	POS	5	we have have the original for 5 year when this one finally give up the ghost . we use it for the purpose of theater entertainment and have serve we well . in the 5 year we use 2.5 lamp -lrb- 1\/2 use be still in the broken unit -rrb- . for the price it sure beat buy a 60 '' tv set , and we have a 120 '' screen . thanks for a great product .
Projector	POS	5	I do not think I can say enough about this product . for a installation , it be perfect . the unit do have a thin skin -lrb- be strike by Wii remote and no issue so far -rrb- . and be bulky for travel ; if you intend to use it in a installation it be great . I mount my from the ceiling and the throw be perfectly suit for this . my price be 644 and this be a steal deal for that . it be bright , able to use it in a room that get muted sunlight -lrb- closed white curtain -rrb- and unshielded -lrb- naked -rrb- light -lrb- 3 of they about 75 watt each -rrb- . only in dark scene do I see shadow on the screen from wall and such behind the projector . this be my everyday tv screen . I have it connect to dish hd -lrb- 1080i -rrb- and with it project to a width of 9 foot you will be awed . watch football will never be the same . I have use the speaker and while it be weak against my 1000 watt thx amplifier , it be perfectly suitable to hear in a reasonably quiet room . pro : bright , short throw , simple setup , 1080p , good value . con : no horizontal keystone , large , appear fragile , no DVI input .
Projector	POS	4	good enough and cheap , great for use at home ! I completely quote the second review ! enjoy this nice projector ! ; -rrb-
Projector	POS	5	the package be real long , but that be obvious consider the one I order be 120 '' ! the whole thing be in two part : the tripod portion and the screen portion . the tripod be a easy setup and the screen snap in with ease . the quality of the material be fine and it do not appear to have any flimsy part to it . this product be easy to setup and tear down -lrb- you can set it up and tear it down in a minute , seriously -rrb- . the white portion of the screen be bright and the screen material be good quality . I highly recommend this !
Projector	POS	5	I love this projector ! it give a very bright display and do not require absolute darkness . very easy to use feature , but impossible to use if you only have a computer with usb port . I have to get rid of my all-in - one to use it .
Projector	POS	5	but , you will want to get a outboard subwoofer to complete the package . I add the Yamaha YST-SW215 subwoofer to complete the bottom end . the proof be when I invite friend over to watch a good sound drive dvd tell they that the main home theater system in the basement theater be be use by my son and he friend . we watch and soon they be ask about the Yamaha sound bar and that it be produce better sound quality than they larger , less discrete home theater system that they own . the Yamaha sound bar be versatile and have all sort of setting that you can mess with to you heart 's or ear 's content . everything from basic output of a news talk program to a `` lush with audio '' dvd to a ipod connection for just plain music . there be setting to satisfy most anyone and those setting product rich sound that a flat paneled sound bar such as this one have no right to reproduce , yet do . to be fair , if you be look or listen for the bottom end , the sound bar itself will not do it , you must add a subwoofer as I mention above . the feedback calibration function be extremely useful in allow you to get dead-on adjustment for your room , not some industry average . I have a particularly odd set up in that the room have a cathedral ceiling and a partially open back end that flow into a galley kitchen . I pay much more for this when it first come out , it be now down in price significantly as there be higher model now available . this be a excellent unit for those of you who do not want or can not have discrete component due to setup or space limitation . Hang it just under you flat screen tv and you have get about as small a footprint as you be ever go to get with top notch sound to boot . grant , it do not possess the heft of my full home theater unit at 200w into 7 channel plus Hsu Research subwoofer ... BUT bang for the buck , this unit will not underwhelm you -lrb- just add the subwoofer , the Yamaha sub unit that I have work just fine and you can let it kick out when there be no sub content in the source ! -rrb- .
Projector	POS	4	this projector work great right out of the box . . hook up the Dish DRV , Xbox , Blu Ray and look great . Thought about a native 1080 , but for the half the price you can not go wrong . . throw a 140 '' image from 18 foot . . kid be happy and so be i. .
Projector	POS	4	this be a great alarm clock . Timex t740 make wake up a alot easier than you every day alarm clock . one of the great feature be a on board flash light that can come in handy during a power outage ... also soothing sound to wake up to .
Projector	POS	5	I read all the review on this product and get it anyway . it arrive right on time . take all the piece out of the box . all be in a neat package with all size in its own case . the instruction be ok but not the best . it do not take long to figure it out . spread out all the package of screw need and figure out what size we need . we size up all we angle and hole . look at the picture and move all the move part around to make the best fit and also enable we to screw all the part together without any interference . once we get the projector and bottom part together it be a simple matter of get to find out where the stud be in the ceiling , screw in the two screw to hold the top piece up and fitting the two piece together . take we about a hour total . we have the thing up and sit down to watch tv in a very short time . Fabulous . great piece of equipment . thanks .
Projector	POS	5	these be great projector ! high quality and last a long time ! Great for indoors and outdoor movie . I use it everywhere !
Projector	NEG	1	I buy this alarm clock for my husband for Christmas . we absolutely love everything about it until it just die . the display just go completely bonkers and be now stick on what look like 1:80 . and , the ONLY thing I do for that to happen be hit the snooze button . really ?!!? now , nothing work to fix it either . we try everything from unplug it , to take the battery in and out , it do no good !! I should of listen to the bad review and\/or buy it locally in store . now , I be face with the pain in the butt decision to I ship it back at MY expense and hope they fix it and\/or replace it with a new one which be asinine ! maybe I 'll just take the hit and learn my lesson the hard way and never buy another Timex again . regardless , it be a darn shame as we love Timex -lrb- at least they old alarm clock -rrb- in the past . my daughter have my old one from 2006 and my husband have one that be still work since he purchase it back in the early 90 's . what a bunch of crook , take people 's hard earn money , by use cheap part that be make overseas that will not last and\/or be defective from the get go !!! and , do not get I start on the LAME 90 day warranty that be pure b !! come on , really ?!!? if I know it come with only a 90 day warranty I would of never purchase this product . it also seem like Timex be not the only manufacturer that have major issue with they projection\/automatic date\/time set alarm clock either . buyer beware !! DO NOT buy !
Projector	POS	5	Compact and light weight , this be aim squarely at the travel business person who need to make presentation while travel , but it be also a handy general purpose projector , if you can accept a few limitation in exchange for the low price . pro : very compact , low price , excellent image quality , good color , good build quality , easy to use , good remote con : no hdmus input , remote not backlit the high lumen mean this projector be very bright and can be use in a room with a fair amount of ambient light . a step up from the 800x600 210 model , the 310 's 1024x768 resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio be fine for present and for dvd 's , gaming , and many video format . it be equivalent to 720p hd -- higher resolution than standard dvd video -lrb- 640x480 -rrb- and fine for streaming video , divx , home video , photo , and similar use . it be very well suit for laptop video game with a mid-level graphic card as well . you get Epson build quality and reliability , long bulb life , good out of the box color , instant on\/off , usb instant play -lrb- for photo , presentation , and pc display , but not suitable for video -rrb- , and VGA -lrb- good for pc Video and general display purpose -rrb- . you get vertical -lrb- but not horizontal , that be reserve for the more expensive 315 model -rrb- lens shift and lot of tweaking option -lrb- most of which you will not need -rrb- . this unit be very quick and easy to set-up and use , and quick to shutdown and pack up as well . I use the VGA input to connect my laptop to the projector , everything work fine and be quick and easy to setup . projector detect the video signal and the auto config work as expect . I project a 84 '' -lrb- diagonal -rrb- image use ECO mode -lrb- lower power\/brightness , less noise , longer lamp life -rrb- and leave the auto iris on -lrb- better black -rrb- . I do not need to make any adjustment to color , everything look good to I . the image quality be excellent for the price . for business purpose , it be very good . for home media , it be acceptable and , at this price , very decent . the black be not `` inky , '' but the image be bright and colorful . also a good choice for gaming via the VGA connection . there be no hdmus at this price , not a issue for business use , but it mean you 'll have to use component output to the VGA input connector via a special cable -lrb- not include -rrb- for best quality dvd\/movie video . no usb cable be include , either , which be a bit lame in my opinion , but , hey , look at the price ! verdict : the basic idea here be to deliver a good quality , budget projector that feature Epson 's key image and build quality , and basic feature , at the lowest cost possible , I believe Epson have hit the target and that these projector will be quite popular . I have raise my initial 4 star rating to 5 star base on my test and performance vs. cost -lrb- i.e. bang for the buck -rrb- . a excellent business projector and a handy all-around projector when use with a laptop or desktop pc via the VGA connector . --------------------- Update 2011-12-01 : photo and Art image look very good to excellent . there be plenty of detail , very bright , fairly sharp , wonderful color fidelity , and overall great image quality . I also do some limited testing to see how this unit would work with streaming video for casual movie watch -lrb- e.g. netflix , Amazon Instant video , etc. -rrb- . image quality be very acceptable . Blacks be decent , thing that be black , look black . this be no match for a good home theater unit , no inky black and `` pop '' here , but a very decent and eminently watchable image . would be great for sport , I be guess . I watch some Netflix film and they look very good , dvd quality plus\/minus depend on source . the Amazon video I watch -lrb- Firefly non-hd -rrb- be a bit lower in quality , but still acceptable . some native video -lrb- i.e. play from laptop hard drive -rrb- look great , near or better than dvd quality , YouTube video be pixellate due to they low resolution , but the higher rez look ok . -lrb- on a 84 '' image , you be go to notice block and pixellation w\/youtube and other lower quality source , so keep that in mind . -rrb- I use blutooth speaker or headphone for audio - do not bother with the projector audio . all in all , it be fun and I be very pleased with the result . I think many would be perfectly happy with this projector for casual movie\/video use -lrb- just do not compare it to a moderate to high-end HT unit -rrb- . the wonderful hbe -lrb- human brain effect -rrb- take over after awhile and you do not really notice any image quality issue . perfectly enjoyable and very inexpensive by comparison . also very easy to set-up and put-away . I project the image on my light beige wall and even that look pretty good . the auto iris do click a bit occasionally -lrb- as with most other unit -rrb- , but you can turn it off if this bother you . it improve the black a little bit , noticeable , but not a dramatic change . if you do not get too hang up on the lower resolution -lrb- vs. the newer 1080p unit -rrb- , moderate screen door effect -lrb- never bother I at all -rrb- , you 'll have a lot of fun . and , at current price , this be hard to beat in term of fun\/dollars spend .
Projector	POS	4	I get compliment on this screen every time I bring company home . my only complaint be it be slightly warped and a shadow show in bright movie frame , I do not know if it be always be there because it be so minor but it be annoy now that I see it . I have have it less then six month so it kind of piss I off for the price I pay . other than that , this screen be awsome !
Projector	NEG	1	I so want this to work . it would have be quite useful in we darkened basement for sleepover and such , not to mention take on vacation . the picture , though , be far too fuzzy to enjoy , and no amount of focus could bring it to clarity . maybe I have a dud -lrb- I do buy from the warehouse at a discount -rrb- , but I be just not impressed with clarity . that say , the ease of use be phenomenal . just turn on , plug in , and play . if you can deal with the fuzziness it might be ok for you . for a couple hundred more , I would prefer just to get a 42 '' plasma for my basement .
Projector	POS	4	use this projector for about a week now and so far so good . I do quite a bit of research on hd projector and find that this be the best one for the price . color be deep and good . image be good even in a reasonably light room . I will share more great purchase overall .
Projector	NEG	1	my pt-ax100u 's iris break after 10 month of use . 8 month after the iris be replace , the new iris break again . since so many people report this problem , Panasonic must recall this projector .
Projector	NEG	1	this quit work after just a few minute . we contact the company which manufacture it , and never get a answer . it go back the next day .
Projector	POS	5	when unpacked , the projector be good and play with a huge screen . downside to this projector be that there be no manual zoom meaning you have to move it closer or further from a wall to adjust screen size . this be a huge downside . I also hook up a PS3 that be work in 3d on a Samsung plasma 3d tv but it will not work on this projector . in fact no 3d source that have try will work on this projector . I have call Optoma and they need to call I back because they do not know what be wrong . I be use hdmus 1.4 and Optoma DLP link glass . all in all I would steer clear of this projector . I be go to revert back to my original year 2000 HP projector over this . first one be defective secondwork perfect and have be use 5 ft from wall at 100 inch and its perfectionist
Projector	POS	5	I have be use this projector for about a month . so far , no problem . Picture quality be very good for a projector price under $ 200 . I order on a Thursday and receive it on Monday . definitely recommend .
Projector	POS	5	I be very impress by this little projector . it will not take the place of the multi-thousand-dollar home theater projector , but if you be plan on use this around the house , you 'll be please . the first thing I notice be that it feel fairly lightweight , but the build quality be still good pretty good . it be not swim with input port , but it have one of all the basics , so it be nothing a adapter or splitter\/switcher can not fix . I run the hdmus to a receiver that provide the extra port I need for my Google TV\/XBox\/etc . , so the lack of extra hdmus port be not a issue for I , but it be something you 'll need to be aware of . I do not have a screen yet , but have be project against a fairly flat\/smooth offwhite wall . with the light off and the shades draw , the output be pretty impressive . the bright color be vibrant and sharp and the dark area be nearly as dark as they can be while be project against a wall in a room with some light bleed from outside . Air quality seem to be important too , we living room be near we kitchen and when we be cooking and there be smoke or steam in the air , even a bit , the light get a little more scatter . it be not a huge deal and you 'll probably only notice if you be look for it , and it be not unique to this projector , though a projector with better black will reduce this a bit . when I get a actual screen and seal up the blind a little better to reduce light come in from outside , I 'll update this review with my thought . I be a little disappointed that it be 720p , but at the distance you 'll use and watch it , 720p be adequate , especially for what this item cost . I do not know if upgrade to another projector at 1080p for $ 300-400 more be actually worth it . this thing also run very quiet so far , I have have experience in the past with projector that sound like they be cool with leafblower , so this little guy have be pleasant . all-in-all I be impressed with the power of this projector , especially for the price range .
Projector	NEG	1	the bulb be for my secondary tv . it be only use during the weekend when the kid be not in school . the bulb be replace a couple week ago and it burn out . the vendor be excellent . I be show what to do to get a replacement . yet the quality of the bulb be definitely not worth to explore
Projector	POS	4	when I plug it into the wall and into my computer -lrb- a ibook -rrb- , it work instantly . genuine plug and play . the menu control , while intuitive , be a little difficult to navigate . I may have to look at the manual . the focus be sharp ; the zoom , while a little limited to suit I , work easily . I plan to love use it . the first time be wonderful . I really recommend it !
Projector	NEG	2	product work great , look great , very quiet motor quite pleased - just complete 6 business session use it . several positive comment
Projector	NEU	3	the video signal be very good , the audio cable do make noise when no audio be play , but it be not notice when audio be be pay . overall , it be good enough for I .
Projector	POS	4	my old home theater room have my Projector on the table , very low class , now I this mount and my home theater be SWEET ! very professional look . my wife really like it .
Projector	POS	4	I receive my Qumi on Saturday from a order place on Cyber Monday -lrb- can not beat $ 100 off -rrb- . I choose the free shipping option and it only take 6 day . I also purchase a $ 7 cctv mount and love that Amazon package multiple purchase into one box . I read multiple review and watch countless comparison video on youtube . I have recently build a 103 '' screen in my basement and have test it use a borrow Viewsonic projector . I love the output but the idea of buy lamp in a few year be not appealing . I decide to try the Qumi because at 30000Hrs i can dedicate a projector for both movie and cable tv without worry about lamp life . I plug the Qumi into my Vizio blu-ray player and load `` Gladiator '' as my test movie . I mount the Qumi at a distance where the picture fill the 103 '' screen . I hit the light and sit down to enjoy . I be honestly surprise . the Qumi do not brighten the room as much as the viewsonic , but that be because the output be focus onto the screen . the image be crisp and focus from the get go and I do not have to tinker much with the focus wheel . I then change over to `` a bug Life '' and this be where it truly shine . the color from the animated movie be astounding . truth be , you can not just judge the output base on one movie , show etc. . try different media . if you plan on purchase this projector for home theater purpose , make sure that you have a relatively dim room . the projector will do well in a light room if you video or image be not dark . I be able to watch '' a bug life '' with full light on in my basement . not so with `` Gladiator '' . plan on use a home theater system for audio unless you plan to use headphone . for its size , i be surprised Vivitek have room for speaker . pro : can not beat 30000 hr . E.g. . if you leave it on for 24 hr , it will last for 1250 day -lrb- 3.5 year -rrb- Easy to mount . I use a ceiling mount for CCTV camera that i purchase together in build media player allow for multiple media option . watch movie download to my harddrive con : be prepared to buy adapter especially if you plan on mount it a good distance from you dvd player .
Projector	POS	5	this be we second MovieMate projector -lrb- we MovieMate 30 still be go strong -rrb- . we love the concept of have a build in dvd player and speaker . you do not need anthing else . the major improvement for the 30 to the 60 be the additional input -lrb- hdmus and VGA -rrb- . the microphone input be also unique add feature that I have not see anywhere else . I love everything about this product .
Projector	POS	4	the screen arrive well package and protect . it be easy to extract from the wrapping with a box cutter . it be also easy to hang . the first thing I do be throw a Blu-Ray movie onto the screen , and it look fantastic -lrb- paired with a 1080p Epson projector -rrb- . con : none -lrb- 1 week of use , so far -rrb- .
Projector	POS	5	love the alarm clock , it have 2 alarm that can be set for weekday , weekend , or both : easy to set and alarm signal blink when you use snooze function .
Projector	POS	5	this be a fantastic little projector it do just what it be mean for , on the spot presentation when you do not have access to a full size projector and you need to get you point across , this be the thing . people be surprise by what it could do I certainly be , I have my power point on a flash drive , prop this little baby up on a couple book have eight client in a little office and they be impressed . I just do not leave home without it .
Projector	POS	5	I find it very easy to setup on both pc and Macintosh computer . oddly , I have a small issue install the usb driver on my Mac laptop . when I connect the usb cable to my Mac , the mac pop up a alert that it could not identify the keyboard . I dismiss that dialog box and proceed with the usb video driver installation and once that be do , the projector pair up with the computer easily . no issue whatsoever connect the VGA cable to the pc with Windows 7 . the projector be immediately recognize by the laptop and the computer automatically start send the video signal to the lcd projector . brightness be in my opinion outstanding , even in a bright room with a lot of fluorescent lighting . I have my projector 8 foot from a wall and the image on the wall be roughly 6 foot wide and about 44 inch tall . I be impress with the amount of feature in this very reasonably price projector . the image be relatively sharp at 800x600 resolution and a zoom control on the projector be a unexpected feature that allow you to zoom in on photo or whatever be be project . the keystone adjustment let you correct for off axis projection angle within reason . just about everything can be control with the provide remote control . the remote even include a electronic pointer function that you can move on the screen via the arrow control . a good variety of port be available include RCA Audio port , S-Video , VGA cable and there be also a usb typea document camera port . a Kensington security lock slot be also available . there be no hdmus connection on this model . the projector let you upload a company logo or image of some sort that can be permanently use as the `` startup screen '' when you first turn the projector on . this can also be password protect thus give some amount of protection if the projector be steal . the operation of the projector can also be protect by a password if you wish . lamp life be project to be up to 4000 hour or up to 5000 hour in ECO mode -lrb- which reduce lamp brightness and fan noise since the bulb run cooler -rrb- . there be several color mode to choose from if you wish to tweak the balance depend on what you be project . overall I be very pleased with the ease of operation and quality of output provide by the Epson ex3210 multimedia projector .
Projector	POS	5	pro : use mostly for presentation and occasionally to display video , amazingly visible in a well illuminated room , minimal difference between ECO and normal mode so you can go ECO mode in any condition , cool feature to adjust light output to compensate wall paint color -lrb- so you can convert any wall into a real screen -rrb- , 6000 hour lamp in ECO , low noise , very good scaling of non native resolution try 1280 x 800 , 1366 x 768 and 1650 x 1080 , I feed a 720p hd OTA TV signal of a soccer game and the picture be excellent , actually amazing for a projector in this price range , brilliant color , lamp replacement around 120 usd , small footprint for a 2700 luman device , very good option for a datum projector at this price . actually this be the second Acer projector I buy for my group , very satisfied with the performance . con : \* no audio . \* no button , the remote control slide in the projector housing to be use as the button station , so if you lose the remote you will suffer , so better keep the remote attach to the projector . \* only 1 year of warranty , all other Acer projector have 2 , not sure why , however for less than 40 you can add 1 year of warranty . \* -lrb- not a con , more like a suggestion -rrb- seem like the auto keystone correction be too sensitive and may try to readjust the image every 5 minute or so , that cause image flickering , so manual keystone adjustment be the way to go . other thought : Acer be do very good electronics at affordable price , I have a Acer AMD laptop -lrb- 4 year old now -rrb- almost indestructible and very reliable , 2 23 '' lcd monitor buy for less than 139 each , very satisfied with Acer , keep the good work .
Projector	POS	5	install be a snap ! we have a previous projector mount that be not universal , and need to replace it due to the projector die . stick this universal one in its place , and it work . come with many part for 4 different type of protector fitting either 3 or 4 screw . the color match we ceiling , so it just blend seamlessly .
Projector	POS	5	I be use this for work presentation . great image at 10 foot ! fit in the palm of my hand . this pack away nicely in a carryon .
Projector	NEG	1	I buy this for new comer briefing for my business . it look good but that be about it . none of the input work . after follow the instruction and plug in a VGA cable to start with , there be a `` no sync '' screen showing . then I try different input include hdmus and s-video to no avail . I have own a few projector and this be product be just a waste of money . I end up purchase a pocket projector with the build in hard drive and good battery life -lrb- mpro150 -rrb- .
Projector	POS	5	the Yamaha ysp-4100bl be everything that it be review claim it be . far superior to the other less expensive competitive sound bar model in construction and performance . in this case , `` you get what you pay for ! '' .
Projector	POS	5	this mount appear to be very well make , but it would not fit the projector that I have purchase . it look like it only work for the smaller size projector . I have to return for a refund and order a new mount from another site .
Projector	POS	5	it work ok , but for the price I would go buy the one from apple . at time the connection be lose . it be a little sensative .
Projector	POS	5	while not as impressive as the surround sound room upstairs , it make a excellent compliment to any tv -lrb- 46 '' Sony XBR Bravia in this case -rrb- in a room that you do not wish to fill with speaker . add a sub-woofer , and the sound be excellent ! I would also suggest wiring the sound from you satellite , dvd\/blu-ray directly to the sound bar as I notice the sound slightly out of sync with the tv if you run it from the satellite and\/or blu-ray\/dvd through the tv and then to the soundbar . I could not justify pay retail price for this soundbar , but at $ 430 I feel it be a bargain and well worth the money .
Projector	NEU	3	Disclaimer : this be the only ceiling mount I have ever buy or use . I have install a lot of thing in my life and in my house , but this be the only projector mount . my impression be that it be as easy or slightly easier than average . you ideally want two people , because it help with : 1 . make sure the pilot hole you be drill into the ceiling joist be all around straight from all view angle 2 . stand beneath the one on the ladder , support the projector from below when it be finally be attach , because it very likely will slip and fall a little at some point , and it be amazing how useless this mount be with a smash projector 3 . understand the slightly too cryptic instruction other random advice : boy oh boy be joist skinnier than wall stud . and you do not want to screw into the edge of one and only discover this when the mount take the weight . we be lucky - we have two test hole which miss the joist , but by insert a large paperclip bent in a c-shape into each and spin they , we be able to tell right away that it be exactly in between the two . I have three problem with this guy . 1 . I install it on a 19 pound Panasonic PTAR100U , a projector I mostly love , especially for its excellent brightness . I try use the extend leg to mount it off-center from the joist . even with the 40 pound limit and the `` no-slip '' lock ring lock , the unit tilted toward the heavy side and there be no way around it . have to set up the leg so the joist and mount be directly above the center of the unit . the instruction do not talk about this . 2 . relatedly : even when balance , even with the `` no-slip '' ring lock , more than the tiniest nudge will tilt the projector in any direction . I call v7 and this be apparently just how the mount work . I be go to have to install some kind of additional stabilizer , like glue , or velcro , or a level that I can use to make sure I be fix it right when it tip again . every time I focus my projector or change the zoom , the image end up shift off the screen somewhere . I zoom out for 1:2.35 widescreen - totally fun with a 2.35 screen and a projector this bright ! but use the joystick to center the image , the resistance in the projector be like sixty time greater than the `` no-slip '' ring , so it be quite harrowing . 3 . it be only available in black , and the projector and ceiling be white . maybe I be crazy , but I think most projector be not black anymore , and most ceiling be some kind of white , so ... maybe that be part of why it be so affordable . all in all , it keep my projector close to the ceiling and it be reasonably easy to install , and it definitely allow for tilt correction more than some mount might -lrb- too much for I ! -rrb- , so it may be ok for you .
Projector	NEG	1	I buy this unit because the specification say he have a powerful and it be perfect for teacher but the device be not even recognize by the laptop , the backlight be terrible in the light of day . the screen size be extremely small and do not match the description give by the seller . definitely do not recommend this product to anyone . the quality be terrible . in addition , I purchase this product from Costa Rica , and now I regret the money spend on this device to bring up my country . this be my first purchase from Amazon disappoint I . people please ... do not buy this unit because they will throw away they money .
Projector	POS	5	I have have the pt-ax 100u for about 3 year now , and I have have the same problem with the iris that several other have comment on . Panasonic be no help and want load of money to repair the unit . of course , it be out of warranty as well ! so instead , I do a google search and find several home `` fix-it '' solution . basically , the iris mechanism have to be re-lubed with some oil after about 2 year of use . I fix my projector in about 20 minute -- and im not technically savvy either . if I can do it , I guarantee anyone can ! as far as the the bulb , I have easily make it to the 2000 hour mark with excellent video quality . I still think this projector be a fantastic bargain !
Projector	POS	5	with purchase be very good . arrange all . color sate . it be focus well . the small . the convenient . as the screen I use a white wall , the picture do not spoil . about what still to write I do not know , but it be require twenty word .
Projector	POS	5	nice usb to pc connection it be truly a plug n ' Play ! I just scan through the Quick Guide and I be able to operate the projector easily . my only concern be whether the 2600 lumen would be enough light intensity consider the natural light present , not to mention the church 's plain white wall be use to project image . however , it be plenty enough the project image off of Power Point presentation be quite legible and colorful from over 300 ft. . needless to say , I highly recommend this product !!!
Projector	POS	4	I buy this as a entry-level projector for my home office , for kind of as a toy\/experiment , and have be please with the result . the picture quality -lrb- 640x480 -rrb- be obviously low-end by today 's hi-def tv standard , but if you goal be to have a big screen at a low price , preferably as you `` secondary '' -lrb- i.e. not as you living room centerpiece -rrb- tv , then this be a good buy . I be use it for dvd , Roku , and computer , project on a $ 50 pull-down screen , and it project a 80 '' image from about 12 foot away . the picture be not too bright , so the room have to be totally dark for best result . the kid love it for the `` movie theater big-screen '' experience , and they do not complain about the video quality . I have use it to watch MLB tv and tv show via Roku , and that be pretty cool - again , we be not talk razor-sharp picture , but definitely good enough for I . I recommend it to any buyer who be ok with adjust his\/her expectation in order to get a inexpensive big-screen `` for fun '' . if you be a buyer who want a top-of-the line high-def video experience , I recommend get a higher resolution tv or projector .
Projector	POS	4	the installation be pretty straight forward . however , adjust it , as one reviewer have mention , can be tricky . when you begin to tighten the allen screw , the arm tend to move in the direction of the turn . also , tighten one axis sometimes jolt the other axis as well . as a result , I have have to just nudge the arm a little even after they be tighten to get they to position correctly . however , when all say and do , this be a extremely good mount . in fact , be be the only one I have find that be able to move my projector forward in the direction of projection .
Projector	NEU	3	this projector ceiling mount be economical and do the job of hold my Optoma projector up in the ceiling . Amazon have help I set up my family movie room by have all the a\/v product available .
Projector	NEG	2	I have own this projector for approximately 1.5 year now . the image the projector put out be great , but there be some obvious design flaw with the lamp cooling system . while the company have replace numerous component at no cost to I as I be still inside the 2 year warranty period -lrb- 2 lamp , the air filter , and now the entire projector -rrb- , at the current rate I expect to purchase a entire new projector within a year of the warranty run out . I have get 9 month out of each lamp so far , and once its out of warranty I will be able to replace the entire unit for the cost of the next two new lamp . I have also be disappoint with how loud it turn out to be , which be in contrast to a number of review I read when decide which projector to purchase . my unit be ceiling mount immediately above the couch , and the fact that the cooling fan be always on be noticible . lastly , my projector be mount near a air conditioning vent and get plenty of cold air , but still can not seem to last more then 2-3 hour without overheate .
Projector	NEG	2	the size and wieght of the unit be excellent . it have all the standard hook-up . the real weakness be the power of the lamp . the image from the projector can not be see in a light room . I think that I could use this for school ; however , the need for dark in order to see the image mean that my student can not see to write note . if you plan to use this product in a semi-lit room I do not think you will be able to clearly see the image project . if you plan to use this projector in a dimly light room , it may work for you .
Projector	POS	4	Pretty happy with this upgrade version . use this toy mainly for watch streaming video movie from Netflix . good for up to 40 in . on the wall in semi-dark env . link via s-video from laptop to composite video on the projector . buy a s-video to rca convertor . pro : - ultra compact - adjustable image size and color - always in focus - no noise con : - poor for view text -lrb- almost can not view any word in m word doc from VGA docking to laptop -rrb- look forward for hd and brighter laser pico projector in the future .
Projector	POS	5	this unit be just amazing .  although the rating be 800x600 , you can display 1024x768 with excellent result . if no one tell you , you would not know that 1024x768 be not the native resolution .  it be very light , and come with a remote that double as a mouse for you computer , which enable you to deliver presentation in a very professional manner .  although the rainbow effect that plague early generation dlp projector be present at time with this unit , I be not bother by it . you can only see it if you look for it , but be non-existant if you be captivate by the movie or show you be watch .  other point : - 1 composite video in - 1 s-video in - 1 vga in - 1 audio in - manual focus -lrb- that be a minus -rrb- - electronic lamp hour usage tracking - 4:3 , native , or widescreen -lrb- 16:9 -rrb- display mode - digital keystoning - it be as loud as a standard computer . so , at night you will notice it when all other sound be mute . that noise be usually cover up by the movie or tv sound or during the day by daily noise .  finally , there be two extra bonus when you get the unit . - the bulb now last 4000hr instead of 3000hr as advertised - it be 1100 luminen instead of 1000 as advertised - the bulb price be down to 299 buck , which make it very economical
Projector	NEG	1	could not read basic type from a computer monitor . totally illegible and pointless . i be expect a cute little energy efficient projector that at minimum could show email and such in meeting but this thing be useless .
Projector	POS	5	we need a extremely bright projector at we church since we have a huge amount of ambient light and other bright stage light in we sanctuary . this one do the trick ! it be like look at a tv screen even with all the other light on when it shine on we projector screen !!!!!
Projector	POS	5	I have have my Powerlite s1 + for a little over a year now , and I have virtually no complaint . through some creative shopping , -lrb- ie . pricematching and mail in rebate -rrb- I only pay about $ 350 for this projector . I have it permanently mount in the ceiling of my basement and have a screen that be about 113 '' diagonal . it have over 1000 hour of use now , and everybody that have be over to watch a movie on it have be totally blow away and they all want one . as far as the $ 100 component video cable from epson , I be worry about this too until I find a local company that make custom datum cable . I pay $ 13 for a 15 foot cable that work beautifully . initially I think maybe when my bulb wear out I would upgrade to a higher end projector , but now that I have have so much enjoyment out of this over the last year , I be plan on stick with it and just buy a new bulb or two .
Projector	NEG	2	I have purchase , this projector to replace my 6 year old NEC projector . I like that it have a hdmus input , 2500 luman , and think it would have a clean sharp picture . but I fail to notice that it be only 800 x 600 resolution . with my picture about 6 foot wide . the picture look blocky -lrb- if that be a word -rrb- . I could actually count the pixel on the screen . I have return this Vivitek projector and purchase another NEC NP216 projector with a 1024 x 768 resolution . the 1024 x 768 resolution make a huge difference in clarity . I will never purchase anything less than 1024 x 768 . I be sure a Vivatek projector with 1024 x 768 or higher would have a better picture .
Projector	POS	4	I actually pick this up refurb ` ed from woot.com , and I have to say I be very impressed with it so far . I buy it because I do not have a tv , and it have all the input a tv have and more : VGA through a include cable , hdmus through a hdmi-to-mini-hdmus cable -lrb- available on amazon for very cheap -rrb- , regular component cable -lrb- come in the package -rrb- , from a micro-sd card -lrb- sell separately -rrb- and also supposedly through usb . pro : - very small and light - come with a padded carry case - perfect for replace a tv -lrb- if you can make the room dark -rrb- - excellent resolution -lrb- 1200x800 max -rrb- - pixel be diamond-oriented -lrb- make movie clearer \/ less pixelated -rrb- - with the battery and micro-sd card , it do not actually need any cable at all - internal memory be big enough for a picture slideshow or a short home video - can flip the image -lrb- so you can run it upside down , or behind the screen , etc -rrb- con : - manual focus , and text will never ever be completely sharp no matter what - when the bottom be in focus , the top be slightly out of focus -lrb- not noticeable in video - only become a issue when read text -rrb- - hole for the tripod be right at the front . this mean that if you buy a small tripod -lrb- like the one recommend on this page -rrb- it will tip over backwards , no matter what you do - not sure how to get usb working . I buy a female-to-female adapter so that I could connect a flash drive to the usb cable they provide , but it do not detect it . I think perhaps you need to buy they proprietary cable -lrb- boo -rrb- overall , I love it . I do not think I would have pay $ 400 for it , but for $ 250 I could not be happier .
Projector	NEU	3	I try connect this projector to the appleTV gen 2 and for much of the content the appleTV refuse to render the image as the projector be not hdcp compliant . the best resolution render be 720p 60hz . the image be excellent but appleTV simply refuse to work with it . I be go to get another cable today before return it to amazon but the packaging say hdcp compliant . I be so glad I purchase this on Amazon to have a easy return . I would definitely get another Optoma though ...
Projector	NEG	2	buy this to mount my Epson 8350 projector ... I be die to get this thing mount and in my living room . however , it be not to be . it `` just miss '' the hole on the 8350 ... some people in the review have say it do fit the Epson 8350 and it have detail instruction . the product I receive do not fit it , and it be `` instruction '' be one sheet of paper let you know how many of each piece you should have , and a schematic . no step by step . regardless , call the return phone number on the packaging , and speak with a woman who say , in addition to the 1 '' and 3 '' extender that be include , they also have 5 '' extender , which would fit the Espon 8350 . they be ship `` for free '' -lrb- with a $ 3 shipping charge -rrb- . so , although it say UNIVERSAL , it be not quite . I 'll update my review when the piece come in ... but I now have to delay hang this a week . I would rather not ... sigh . = = = = = update = = = = = i receive the extender ... and it work fine . but it be false advertising to say this be `` Universal '' when it do not fit all projector . so ... buyer beware .
Projector	POS	5	this product do everything it be suppose to do very well , I would recommend it . the projector I be try to mount have its mount location in the strangest place and this mount be able to be adjust to where it need to be .
