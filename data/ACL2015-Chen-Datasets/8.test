Projector	POS	5	I have to admit , that this be not the easiest equipment to put together , but that be mainly because it have to be versitile . all projector mount situation be not the same , so I can understand why the manufacturer do not supply specific instruction . if you be handy , or have someone around that be , I would highly suggest this . if you have trouble with assemble Ikea furniture , I would look elsewhere . in my situation , I have a drop ceiling with you typical cross beam above . this work out great , and I have be able to cut a 2 '' hole in the ceiling tile , and adjust the mount 's extention arm to the perfect height . this way I be not worry about duck under a projector constantly . White be a good match , as it would be for most ceiling . overall construction be sturdy , and not much movement once everything be tighten down . I would have a set of hex wrench ready , because although they provide you with one , it be necissary to have one on each side when really tighen . about 30-40 minute assembly time .
Projector	POS	5	I like product that be as simple as possible and require very little set up time . I be able to get this up and run with my computer within 3 minute without even look at the user guide . when I start stream a movie from Netflix , the picture be a crisp 70 '' movie-theater quality picture -lrb- really crisp when I turn off the light -rrb- . I be really glad I buy this instead of a lcd screen . the basics : - come with a VGA connector for you computer - you do not need to buy it separately - it be incredibly light at 5 lb - very portable - the cord to connect it to the power supply be pretty short -lrb- estimate at 3-5 foot -rrb- , so you might need a extension cord depend on where you put it in you room - no speaker - you 'll need separate speaker . I just buy Sony gaming speaker to connect via usb to my computer for a full home theater experience
Projector	NEG	1	UNFORTUNALLY I have to SAY that this item be the worst thing I have VER BOUGHT in MY LIFE , I do weekly presentation at work & GUESS what , I almost lost my job over this item , it work fine a COUPLE of TIMES & THEN IT just stop it just would ` nt do anything . please DONT BUY UNLESS you know HOW to fix it ... SORRY
Projector	POS	5	as long as you be not work in a big theater , this be a terrific projector for everyday presentation . it be one of the least expensive on the market , and easy to use right out of the box . the control be super-easy and the hook up simple and clear . a nice sharp , bright image in a very small and lightweight package .
Projector	POS	5	I be a little skeptical of 5 star review , but this mount most certainly deserve that ! I recently purchase a Planar Pd7060 , and be in need of a mount with good adjustment , due to my low drop ceiling in my theater\/basement . -lrb- the Planar do not have a lens shift ... -rrb- as mention in earlier review , the instruction be lack , but the build quality of this thing more than make up for the shortfall of the literature . I have to make a brace behind the ceiling tile outof 2x 's and that probably take longer to do than install the projector . I be very pleased with all the tilt , yaw , forward , back , and side to side adjustment that can be make . it be very easy to square the projector to the wall or screen you be project on ... it have a variety of bolt include for mount you projector , I do not need to go to Lowe 's or hd to pick up any thing ... my Planar have three mount point , and the mount have 2 set of 3 adjustable arm , that I be sure will work with almost any projector . W there be set screw in every adjustable pivot point to lock you setting in place . this thing will not move ! pricepoint and versatility be top notch ! I order the black version , but this be the same model .
Projector	POS	5	i be use this projector in a linux -lrb- ubuntu -rrb- system . the quality of the image be perfect ... it be easy to set up -lrb- in fact , there be not necesary to do anything at all , just to plug it on -rrb- . the image size be always the same , it just depend of the projection distance . but the image resolution depend of the connection wire -lrb- if a s-video the max resolution be 800x600 , if VGA the resolution grow up to 1920x1200 ... -rrb- and the graphic card . i be project the movie to a white wall , and have a image size about 1.80 m diag with 3m distance between wall and projector . it be not necessary to turn off all the ligth because the high contrast ratio , but it be better if there be not a lot clarity in the room .
Projector	POS	5	Have have this for 10 month and it have perform flawlessly . even have a few power outage that shut it down unexpectedly and it still work great . on a 135 '' screen and seat 12 foot away , the picture be great . maybe 1080p would be better but most of what I watch be not 1080p and for the price and lamp life , you can not beat it . more hdmi input would be nice but you can always buy a hdmus switch . I only watch it on eco mode and the picture be great -lrb- window be completely black out and only ambient hall lighting from downstairs -rrb- . even with light on , it do not totally wash out the screen . I be very pleased with this projector and it should last I a while until 1080p projector with longer lasting light source come along -lrb- at a reasonable price -rrb- . do not know about 3d because I be a cheapskate that will not pay $ 100 for glass .
Projector	POS	5	this be a winner . Works very well , color be good , and adjustable , frame alignment for key ning be good , quite a package for the price !
Projector	POS	5	I use the Vantage Point cgupm12-s to mount a Panasonic pt-ae200u projector . the mount be easy to put together and install , work great , very adjustable , well make , look good . I would highly recommend this product . I call Vantage Point to make sure the mount would work with my projector , they return my call and be very helpful .
Projector	NEU	3	although it do the job represent , the camlock to hold the screen in position be very flimsy and during the second use I have to shore it up to prevent the screen from fall down .
Projector	POS	5	I be very happy with this purchase . the projector screen be truly excellent . I like the fact that it come with two remote control . I also like that the you can stop the screen at any height you want . the motor be very quiet and you can hardly hear it . the screen really make the color of my Epson 8350 Home Cinema 1080p projector really come alive a show its 1080p capability . I make my family room a home theater and it really look amazing . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that want a high quality electric projector screen . buy it and you will know exactly what I mean . excellent price and excellent quality . the Favi hd-150 projector be under-priced .
Projector	NEG	2	I love the size but , picture quality be lack and I buy mine so my wife could use it at school in a room with the light off . I guess there be still too much light because it be impossible to see . I should have save my money . great concept just not bright enough
Projector	POS	5	this be my first projector . all I can say be wow . I use this projector for everything . it be my computer monitor and my tv . I go from a 28 '' lcd computer monitor that I be happy with to this projector which I be thrill with . there be nothing like play a game and fight a 6 ' troll that be actually 6 ' on the screen ! my big concern with buy a projector be clarity and screen refresh rate . dvd , blu-ray , Netflix all show clear and beautiful . fp and online rpg like WOW and eq2 be all clear and smooth . there be no bluring , artifact , or lag from this projector . the bad ... black level . they be not terrible but at some time the dark or black area be a little wash out . this be in a totally dark room . it be also be project on super-white photo paper -lrb- diy screen -rrb- . for the lower cost of this projector and the longer bulb life I can easily live with this . also , text be sometimes a little blury . not a lot , just a tiny pinch . but it may not be the projector . clean the lens with proper lens cleaner clear some of it and I may need to look into a new screen or tighten my current one -lrb- it seem to be a bit difficult to get the DIY paper screen perfectly sag and wrinkle free -rrb- over all I love this projector . UPDATE : after 1044 hour on the bulb -lrb- 9 month -rrb- it go dim for a day then go out with a pop . Epson be easy to contact . I send they a email . the next day they send I a email ask specific question , one of which be my address . two day later I have a new bulb . Free of hastle , Free of charge .
Projector	NEG	1	this projector do not work properly and the vendor do not respond to inquiry . the product do not come with complete warranty information or address for service . there be no contact information for the manufacturer . you be better off with a name brand and\/or local vendor .
Projector	POS	5	I purchase this projector because of its size , I can easily carry it with I from home , classroom , and meeting . it fit in my purse and along with a netbook make for a very versatile , easy to carry system . the image be bright clear and easy to see , and the speaker be very good . we child hook they computer up and view the screen on the living room and they bedroom wall . it be easy to move around ~ one of the girl use it with she rocket team in the backseat of the van so all team member could see and discuss the computer output , and need change for the next qualify launch . it can be use everywhere , even outside to watch show on the front porch . the price make it most affordable . I have be delighted to have it .
Projector	POS	5	I buy this for my husband for Christmas . nice general alarm clock with a few extra . the large display on the ceiling be awesome ! no need to crank neck around pillow in the middle of the night . the nature sound be ok . the time be pre-set , so all that be involve be plug it in . it have a flashlight as well , but we have not use it yet . overall it be a nice alarm clock .
Projector	NEG	2	so , I do a ton of research before make this purchase , and I be still blind-sided by poor design choice across the board on the pk301 . First of all , I be mac base , so in order to convert my video file -lrb- why do this not offer the ability to play back more codec ? -rrb- I have to load up handbrake . after several hour of completely waste time convert video to the claim acceptable codec and fail to have any of they work on the projector , I sit down and begin to search for a answer online -lrb- the proper info on how to handle the video file convert for mac user be not include in the manuel -rrb- I manage to figure out the very strict guideline for the file conversion process . I begin convert a few video to test the projector and put they on a 4gig microsd card . the first video I transfer be a 22 minute tv show . the file size come to be around 540mb . it do not work . I spend another half day struggle with this until I try change the file 's extension from . m4v to . mp4 . miraculously , once I do that , it play fine . would have be good to know this a day earlier . seriously ? seriously ? ok . so after all that , I finally have the proper -lrb- and somewhat tedious -rrb- direction on how to get these file prep to work on this thing . boy , let I tell you , you better not be the spontaneous type , because the the time it take to prep a video file for this thing be enough to kill the spirit of any group hope to watch a video outside on the fly . second major problem be the battery life . now , EVERY single write up I find online mention some fabled `` extended 5 hour battery '' for this thing . where ? where be it ? I 'll pay for it ! I have the money . 200 dollar ? fine ! fine ! where the hell be it ?! it do not exist . that be all there be to it . it be not real . do not buy this thing because of that `` 5 hour battery '' you have read about on every single tech blog that mention this projector , because it do NOT EXIST . so , as a alternative , there be third party adapter that do not come package with the proper cable to be use with the pk301 , so who need that ? yet another ridiculous brick wall separate I from really enjoy this projector . sure , you can find a extra batter -lrb- the exact same one that come with the projector -rrb- for 30 buck ... but where the hell be the 5 hour ? where ? where be IT?@!!!@!!!!! the next problem be the internal firmware . come on guy . Update please . and post the update on you website and make it easy to find and implement on both MAC and PC . this be just ridiculous . if one of my movie file be bigger than 2gigs it will not show up as a valid file ? be you serious ? why ? so I have to go through the messy process of trial and error in order to break my movie file up into multiple smaller file on order to use they on this projector ? this be absolutely unnecessary ! get in there and overhaul the firmware of this thing and update it ! make it better ! add more codec ! allow for the recognition of larger file ! release the extended battery ! what the hell be the matter with this company ? it could be so easy to dominate the pico projector market with these simple product adjustment and additional support . the other problem here be the provide cable . if you want to use you iphone or ipad , you 'll need to dig around and figure out what sort of adapter and nonsense you 'll need . I have not bother yet , but I be sure it will probably set I back another couple of hundred buck and about 4 daisy chained cable before I have thing set up . from what I have read online you 'll get you Iphone or Ipad connect , but the slightest movement could result in the cable lose they connection . you 'll have to jiggle they in order to get it back up . wonderful . why not one cable ? directly from the Iphone\/Ipad , right into the projector via usb or mini hdmus ? do this exist ? well , if it do , I be sorry I do not spend the better part of my week painstakingly search the deepest part of the internet in order to find it . I guess it be my fault . I 'll get right on that . let I free up my schedule for the rest of the month so I can devote every wake moment to comb the endless span of the internet in order to find this nonexistent direct connection ipad\/iphone adapter and `` 5 hour '' extend battery . to be completely honest , I would not be this upset if this product be not so so close to be incredible . I have thousand of movie and tv show save as AVI , DIVX , etc. . I be ready and willing to spend more money on a -lrb- good -rrb- extend battery . I would spend money on a simple Iphone \/ Ipad adapter . come ON .
Projector	POS	5	I read a lot about how the packaging on the product do not provide adequate protection for the projector screen during shipping . the company must have read those because the packaging might have be able to stop a bullet . the item arrive in perfect condition even with some dent on the box from shipping . the screen itself have no wrinkle or crease . go up and down very easily and I pair it with a optoma hd20 at a throw distance of just over 15 ' and it look awesome . I could not be more excite with my home theater . I highly recommend this screen . it really stack up compare to much more expensive fix frame screen .
Projector	POS	5	this amazing little piece of technology have blow my mind . I turn my empty bedroom wall into a 50 '' screen . I have show family member travel photo at a moment notice . I have impress a few young woman at the bar . quite simply , you have the ability to project a screen of vary size anywhere - it be quite the feat and really quite fun as you watch other `` ooh and ahh '' at this technology . enjoy !
Projector	POS	4	this projector be definitely the one you want if you be look for one that be affordable , light and convenient . I be a teacher and I love this because it be so easy to set up and use and the display be clear and just like that of those other big and bulky projector . I can actually carry this one in my bag without any hassle . it be compact , and do not need to rear up , do not overheat ... I just can not say enough . . I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! the only reason why I give it 4 star be because of the tripod stand ... due to the imbalance weight , set off by the cord on one side . . the tripod keep fall . so I simply just do not use it and prop it up on book instead . my son first birthday be come up and I intend to use it to project picture at he party . it be so small and light weight ... they would not even know it be there . -lrb- smiley face -rrb- do I say I love this projector !!! well I do ! definitely a good buy for half the price !!
Projector	POS	5	5 minute out of box and watch a movie . the video quality be really good for how much we pay for it . it be project onto a paint wall and look better than many other projectors\/tvs I have see recently . at about 16 foot from the wall the picture be huge , maybe equally 16 foot . have the sound go through another receiver and speaker set up make it feel like be in a theater . my wife 's friend see it and think she would get one too . really happy with the purchase so far .
Projector	NEG	1	I be so excited to get this projector , but I be on my second one thus far , and needless to say , I be not happy at all . the first qumus I receive work great ... for one day . after that , it do not matter what device I plug into it -lrb- blurry player , iPad , iPhone , xbox -rrb- , or in what order I plug the device in , or in what order I turn on the devices\/qumi , or which hdmi cable I use to do it -lrb- I purchase several and try they on to no avail -rrb- , I repeatedly and consistenly receive the `` no source found '' message . needless to say , I be not pleased , so I send the unit back and request a replacement from Amazon -lrb- who have be nothing but great throughout this horrific process btw -rrb- . Guess what , I receive the replacement in record time . Guess what , same hdmus handshake issue . these unit be either not build well or Vivitek 's quality control be abysmal . bad customer service as well . there be get to be something better out there . very dissapointed .
Projector	POS	5	the only negative thing I can say it be for the bolt hole configuration for the ceiling support if you use a generic product . that be a great product for this price !
Projector	NEG	1	get the lamp , unpack it then put it into my sharp xr-10x projector and turn it on . wait for a couple of minute but the lamp never illuminate . the Projector say the lamp have a lamp circuit failure or be burn out , even though it be brand new ... either way it just do not work at all
Projector	POS	5	this be a good travel projector . it work well in medium to low lite . you have to buy a extra adapter to connect you ipod . the battery only last about a hour .
Projector	POS	5	just get my Electric Favi Screen 120 '' -lrb- hd-120 -rrb- , all i can say be perfect , im satisfied with the quality of the screen , the place on where i order it -lrb- Ace Photo Digital , 3rd seller party at amazon -rrb- they didnt use ups\/fedex to deliver the item but use this company call `` Home Direct '' and all i can say be awesome customer service , they be call I everytime to update the status of the item , the box be perfect and the delivery guy really handle the item with care . overall im satisfy . note : if you install this thing on a drywall ceiling like i do , i recommend use this anchor  Red Head EZPPL100 E-Z Self-Drilling Plastic Drywall Anchor -lrb- 100 per Box -rrb-  this be Screen be great with Epson 8350 on a 12 foot throw .
Projector	POS	5	so far , so good ... work just fine , and everything be as promise !! thank you . great value in a very timely fashion !!
Projector	POS	5	have this screen for about 5 month now . awesome product . everyone be surprise about how economical this screen be , but same quality as the expensive one , and more low profile than a lot of the competitor .
Projector	NEG	1	this projector be not worth you time , put you 80 $ towards a better machine . the bulb blow after six to eight movie worth of use , the fan be quite loud , and the color be off . the resolution be so low that video game text be unreadable and detail be blurry . we have try various image size and distance from the wall , it simply have too low of a resolution to display text or detail appropriately . there be no keystone setting , so the projector must be place in a straight line , directly across from the wall , and the plug be very short , so projector placement be a issue . I would not put this in a child 's room either , as the bulb blow if the unit be knock , and the unit produce a lot of heat . you would be better off spend a few dollar more and get a projector that will not require constant bulb replacement and provide a sharper picture .
Projector	POS	5	I just love this projector ! use it for Movie Night under the Stars ! Easy set up ! it be a great product for the price .
Projector	POS	5	great product , especially for the money . come with every piece you could possibly need . the seller be exceptionally great . I receive the product before the estimate arrival .
Projector	POS	4	the potential for this little projector be fantastic . but along with other reviewer , I feel that the technology be not quite on par yet to demand the price . what would be useful be a plug and play device that would allow a travel business person to easily -lrb- note the word : easily -rrb- queue up presentation on a laptop , etc for view in a board room , etc. . when I see this little projector , that be my first thought . I use a  Apple MacBook pro MC700LL\/A 13.3-Inch laptop  after search on the web , I find more information on the 3M site regard this little machine . unless you be desire to watch certain type of media -lrb- movie , ppt presentation or video -rrb- , I could not get the device to work . what about the simple concept of projection ? project my screen up onto a larger screen -lrb- if use a laptop -rrb- . I could not successfully accomplish this . perhaps a later iteration of the product will be more flexible , provide more instruction and fewer cable and confusion . the projector be not short on anything except instruction on how to use it . it be not as plug and Play as one would think . the ONLY real thing I do with it be watch a movie from my ipad use a include cable . not very useful since there be not enough sound capability to even count . this little projector be probably just at the beginning of it be type . I have confidence that in the future new iteration will be better and more intuitive . 3 star .
Projector	POS	4	I actually have work with EPSON unit with similar specification to the vs315w with regard to input and output , and find this a very comfortable personal fit . if I be to gauge the market for this I would push it toward people who be not early adopter and probably be use 3 or 4 year old computer , dvd player -lrb- heck , even VHS player -rrb- , and do not depend upon high quality sound . people with older equipment -lrb- I -rrb- will like this projector most . VGA video input and display be excellent . rca cable audio\/video input be excellent video , audio not so awesome . usb audio\/video input work , but be overall inferior . hdmus input ? not a issue for I . if you need it , do not get this box . the sound quality through the projector be mediocre which should not be a surprise for any projector of this class . the video be not for cinephile , but if you do not push the projection distance or the room lighting , the video quality can be excellent . set up for optimal distance and lighting be something that be almost only resolve in the specific environment where the equipment be use . my requirement be old school - primarily be able to use VGA to VGA for video input , or to use rca cable for audio\/video input -lrb- primarily video -rrb- . about the only time I would use the build in sound be when I be test something , or in a emergency when I do not have time to set up as I wish . the vs315w 's speaker be serviceable , but in the same way that a lot of laptop and tablet speaker be serviceable . best use in intimate setting , you will hear the sound , you will not be impress . even though it be market for its portability and easy set up and play , this be not my first choice as a stand alone . my one test with the usb input be quite unimpressive . the driver install on laptop easily , and it hook up easily . static video display -lrb- slide -rrb- be fine , but motion can be `` iffy . '' sound be actually similar to the other hookup , but with such crummy video I be not sure that matter . I also set up this unit in these two way : 1 -rrb- hook up video with VGA to VGA cable to 4 year old Dell Inspiron laptop . screen be about 20 foot from projector in a `` medium '' light room . for sound in this scenario I just run a small sound out patch cable from the Inspiron into a separate boombox and use that for my portable speaker . I have find very few projector have any decent sound . you would be surprised how use a portable sound system with nice speaker can enhance the video experience . anyway , follow by a little tweaking use the vs315w 's pretty standard menu system , and rely on the excellent automatic anti-keystoning feature -lrb- plus I love the manual keystone control button located conveniently on top of unit -rrb- I have a excellent 1280 x 800 wxga image project in a couple of minute . I run some dvd video through my pc and notice some jaggedness and some color problem - the fancier the video -lrb- e.g. , Transformers -rrb- the worse the performance . animated film come across beautifully , but they do have simpler color pallet and less demand on motion . the one powerpoint presentation I use have no true video , but quite a few animation which display to perfection . 2 -rrb- hook up video and audio with rca cable from my $ 20 Memorex dvd player . Video and sound be almost exactly as above . again , I prefer external speaker so I detach the white\/red rca sound connection and run the dvd player 's sound through my boombox again . obviously , none of this be the portability be market -lrb- carry around a dvd player or laptop , with extra boombox and this projector -rrb- . I give this four out of five star because it do what it say it do it within the publish specification . one star be knock off because the one fairly unique feature , the usb plug and play , do not seem to be ready for prime time yet . I 'll personally be use this primarily for in-office presentation in the configuration describe above .
Projector	POS	5	this be a total awesome projector ! I believe it be one of the better one for it be price & the picture be totally awesome for the size it can project . definately get what you pay for , so do not be fool into buy less expensive projector that will disappoint , when this will satisfy you home Theater craving . sure if you can afford higher Lumens , contrast , & \/ or resolution . this be a great starter projector until the more expensive price start drop more & all plazma & other become more affordable .
Projector	POS	4	the product arrive as promise on time and pack well . install lamp into projector and do have a burning odor when it start up , but seem to be work fine and odor go away . we will see if it last ! if it do it be a great price !
Projector	NEG	1	8\/16\/11 : I have now enter the 21st century with this alarm clock ! it have so many wonderful feature ! first , the number be nice and large , so it be easy for this Baby Boomer to read ! it also have a projection feature that project the time on the ceiling ! so I do not have to look at the clock to see what time it be , just take a look at the ceiling ! second , it have a automatic time zone feature . in program mode , select the number that correspond to you time zone and voilum ! it automatically set it for the time and date ! Third , it have two separate alarm . depend on the type of wake-up call you want , you can set alarm 1 for a gentle wake-up call -lrb- soothing sound for example or easy listening -rrb- and alarm 2 for those urgent , immediate wake-up call on the day you have to get to work asap . and you have you choice of soothing sound : bird chirp & chime , ocean wave , etc. . you can program the alarm to set off 7 day a week , Mondays-Fridays only , or weekend only . that be a great feature so you do not get wake up to you favorite Heavy Metal station on the weekend ! it have a backup battery system that will still wake you up even if you have a power outage during the night . my favorite feature be the `` Sleep '' feature , in which you can set the clock to play soothing sound for 60 - 99 minute . this help to put I and my little pre-school son to sleep . it shut off after the alloted time . the instruction be easy to read and follow , although you do have to read they to figure out the feature . 8\/19\/11 UPDATE : I have be force to lower my rating from 5 star to 3 . I guess that be why this clock be only $ 29.99 . after about 3 day , it start to do some wonky thing . I be use the `` Sleep '' feature to play the soothing sound mode and that have stop work . when I press it , the display alternately flash the time and a radio station . I keep have to play with it until I can at least get the soothing sound to play . it have a very long , thin wire antenna which could easily break off , so that be not so great . alarm 1 seem not to work all the time . I keep refer to the instruction to reset the `` Sleep '' feature and alarm 1 , and I do everything step by step , yet the `` Sleep '' feature do not work and alarm 1 be iffy . the instruction be not very good when you be try to troubleshoot . too bad , because the feature be really nice on the clock ... if only they would keep work . 9\/2\/11 UPDATE : Radio no longer work . soothing sound do not work . Sleep mode do not work . I set alarm 1 for 6:45 AM and it somehow switch on its own to 6:45 pm . drop rating to 1 star . I have have the clock for almost a month , and it seem more of its feature stop work . I do not recommend this clock . the basic clock still keep time , and the projection light work , but that be about it . 9\/15\/11 UPDATE : alarm do not work at all . the only thing this clock do be keep time . the light that reflect the time on the ceiling still work , but all the other feature do not . I have never have a product go bad so quickly . 9\/20\/11 : clock be DEAD . have to unplug it while clean . when I plug it back in , nothing display . never have I have a product that die so quickly as this one . save you money and buy another brand . do not buy this clock . Timex be know for watch , but not alarm clock . total disappointment .

Projector	POS	5	just like everyone else i do my own research for week . be debate on a 1080p device or 3d ready device with 720p . come down to this sucker and i aint look back ! personally i like be amaze and on top of be amaze i like save money = -rrb- . that be say this be the perfect projector for I to get because i of course take advantage of its 3d processor ! i buy the viewsonic vp3d1 converter and it work great ! i first test it out with my xbox 360 but have some trouble at 1st because my output setting be at 1080p and this device -lrb- viewsonic vp3dus -rrb- only read 1080us . once i switch the setting to 1080i the projector also allow the 3d option to turn on . as far as the quality of this projector its brilliant ! good for day and night setting . color be awesome and quality be good as well . use through hdmus port which native be 720p 20mhz but with the viewsonic converter it automatically convert it to 1080i 60mhz . only when its actual 3d content will it then display it at 720p 120mhz . as far as the glass i buy the optoma dlp lnk hz1 . my testing be still not complete as i still have to get a blue ray 3d player . im very impressed and satisfied with my curent set up . in all great 3d home theater set up for $ 1k
Projector	POS	5	let I start by say I like to buy american as much as possible . with that say ... I see no american company that can match the price of this quality product . the screen be bright and full size as advertise . the review that I read be dead on in regard to the 5 star rating . I have to wait about a month to get it as they be all sell out even from FAVI . the screen do curl slightly on either edge as -lrb- i guess -rrb- all non-tension screen do . however the black border be wide enough that it do not affect the picture at all . the motor be a little noisey and the screen seem to go up and down slowly . however at $ 163 for a 92in electric projection screen -lrb- deliver -rrb- you cant complain -lrb- I know I just do -rrb- . when people come into my theater roon -lrb- convert basement -rrb- they think I win the lottery and spend a mint on a new home theater . truth be tell I have less invester in my 92in , 7.1 , Blu-Ray system then I do in my 42in plasma 5.1 dvd system in my living room . so I guess except for support a China base product I love it so far . and yes when I be hungery and out of work I will need to eat my projector , projector screen and most of my other electronics ... still cant beat the price - deliver ...
Projector	NEG	2	I purchase this projtor base on the mostly positive review . First of all please note that this be not a hd projector . it simply accept hd signal via HDMI for example and the video signal be be downsize to VGA picture quality . furthermore , the color be completely off . I be debate with myself if it be worth it to send it back and get another projector and ask friend who be over and the verdict be that this hurt they eye . do you research and be aware of these factor . if you want a better picture , then simply go with a name brand .
Projector	NEG	2	this be a good concept however the delivery of the product be cheap at best . the container be make of metal that be too thin to actually hold together . critical bracket be break when I receive the unit . also the screen be dirty and this should never happen in a new product . would not buy another one .
Projector	POS	5	I get mine on sale last year . what a bargain . great pix , versitile , & super bright ! we can watch it in the daytime it be so bright . I use it on the road for my show so it get use & abuse a lot . it be still run perfect on it be original bulb . when it be not on the road it be use as my primary widescreen tv at home . this unit will not show full the resolution of true quality hdtv , but do a excellent job . many hdtv signal have be downscale , upscale , dowscale again , recompressed , & reprocess so many time by the time it reach you home , most of the channel be not true hdtv quality anymore anyhow ... esp . signal through cable & satellite . I guess the FCC have not pass any law for hdtv quality yet . the unit have more than enough resolution for ordinary DTV & DVDs . for some reason , I do not get eye fatigue like I do watch other projector a few hour . the factory preset be not that good & seem to be for watch ordinary analog TV & VHS tape . fortunatly it come with 3 user settable preset with a very wide array of setting & tweak that make it a top quality performer . I buy the component input adapter for it from Infocus . the quality of the adapter cable be poor & pick up plenty of RFI . also after carefully unplug it only a few time , one of the connector fall right off the adapter . poorly , cheaply design adapter concider most infocus product be specifically design to be use on the road , set up & tear down easily & quickly all the time . the connecter for my other road equipment do not break after year of heavy use . fortunately for the road & at home the s-video connector do a excellent job . do not ever use the ordinary rca-jack style composite signal jack on a hi-end tv or projector . the signal will not be good enough . any good tv will just make the poor signal quality more obvious . the above reviewer must have get a bad unit or one that be bang around during shipping , or be drop . these be durable unit , but with too much bang around , you 'll have problem the reviewer describe . the grind sound come from the color wheel or blower fan be knock out of alignment . I also own they older lp-350 xga model & use a few of they other model . so far I be very happy with all of they I have use . although my very old lp-350 still work like new , I have do some mod on it & the lens to increase the contrast ratio , brightness & bulb life . I be surprised that if I can do it , that infocus do not offer a mod plan for they to do it for a price . they will not even sell spec & technical service datum on they old machine . I guess they want you to pay a arm & leg for they to do repair , or buy a new one . I have have to fix a few infocus projector out of warranty after they be bang around or just get well use & old ... with no help or sevice datum from infocus , even though it be request . fortunately , dlp projector have be around for a while now , so there be plenty of qualify tech familiar with they in just about every town who know how to fix , mod , & upgrade they at a fraction of the cost infocus will once they be out of warranty . from what I read in the past , you be better off send it to a local tech with experience with dlp machine for repair rather than back to InFocus . they seem to do a better job cheaper , & know what they be do . Infocus will not even to tell you where to get special tool need to take they apart . I wonder if they know how to service they at all . it be one thing to build one , but another thing to troubleshoot & fix 'em . I give 5 star for the product , not for the service , because I service all my own equipment so do not need they . do not take these thing apart yourself people unless you know exactly what you be do & experience . you can ruin or destroy they if you be not very careful & knowledgable .
Projector	NEU	3	this project be very decent for the money you pay the picture image be not bad . however I be very excite to learn that this projector come with a spare bulb as we all know how expensive they could be . this be one of the main reason that drive I to buy this model once I recieve the item and try it out the bulb inside the projector be break . so much for the spare bulb .
Projector	POS	5	I be hesitant in buy a non familiar name FAVI , but by read the other review and what i be look for , this be the best bet . I be first impress by the packaging it come in . I read a few reviw where customer box be beat up and not work properly when the item first arrive . but with -lrb- retail ace -rrb- i be very happy with the packaging . second , i be impress by the quality of the product . the motor of the screen be very quiet . other customer have problem with the motor be too loud , but not with favus . after install the screen -lrb- which be very simple -rrb- i hook up my ps3 to it and see a dramatic difference in the quality . honestly im very happy with the screen and by purchase this great screen with such a great price you cant go wrong . Dont get confuse by purcash the $ 500 + screen when you can get a great product at a great price !!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS !
Projector	POS	4	I have use this with both my macbook pro and also my ipad with no problem . the re be great and the image be very bright . flawless performance .
Projector	NEU	3	basically this product be purchase because of the low cost and its description , take into account some feedback from other buyer . my expreiencium with it work very well , but in the dark , in a room you should turn off the light so you can watch it . he sharp left to say , especially the more control you must take care that the same projector , because he be the life of the projector . if you get lose or lose , it be like if you lose you projector , you may be handicap .
Projector	POS	5	absolutely thrill with this purchase . Pictures look great and dvd look super . exceptionally bright for it be size . razor sharp picture . other have comment about excessive fan noise but it be not so bad as to be a huge drawback . on board speaker however be very weak . but I be still thrill with the picture . love the size and weight of the projector . feel very sturdy . and a special piece of advice to those that purchase this ... when power the unit down let the unit run it be course in the shut down process ! it be very important that the unit cool itself off before it automatically turn the fan off . so do not power it off and then go and pull the plug out from the wall . let it run until the fan cut off -lrb- 90 seconds to 2 minute I think -rrb- .
Projector	POS	5	this be my first screen projector I purchase and I love because it give you a theater look and feeling . but , the only flaw to the projector that be throw to the screen be that it be hard to adjust to the size and you have to keep position the projector . the screen be not the problem it the projector throw so buyer beware to make sure you know the size of screen because if the projector do not throw right on the screen it will appear off the screen slightly or to much off the screen . once again it be not the screen that be the problem it be the projector that have to throw the image . other then that the screen be wonderful and I love it . for better imaging it be best to mount the projector in the ceiling for better throw . other then that I can not wait to use it outdoors !!
Projector	POS	4	I end up buy this Epson as it have the combination I be look for : size : as I need something very portable . money : as I do not want to spend over $ 600 . clarity : as I need to do PowerPoint presentation in well light medium size room with audience from 5-70 . I would say the this projecter exceed my expectation in all 3 category . the size be smaller than I expect . it fit perfectly along with my MacBook in the same briefcase which be not that big . the usb connection to my Mac work great and no setup need . it connect to my Mac via usb and via the include video cable -lrb- of course you need to have the MAC video adaptor if you wih to use the standard video cable -rrb- . calrity be great and the picture be sharp in the native 1024x768 resolution , enough in a well light room with a screen size of about 100 '' use economy mode . the only caveat be the fan sound be a bit loud , so in a smaller area it will be noticeable and will require you shift to economy mode , which be extremely reasonable . my thought be the projector small size have to do with the fan be noisy as there be no easy way to discharge so much heat through a small opening without much noise . lead projecto size be so small be tempting , but be a bit on the weak side for daylight . I check all of they -lrb- Optoma , Viewsonic , Acer and LG -rrb- . Casio be awesome but cost be -rrb- $ 800 , and the fan get a bit loud on this model as well . to get something in this size in lcd , I would have have to go to SVGA -lrb- 800x600 -rrb- . so for a combination of size , clarity and cost , this one be the best I could find . for $ 500 , this be a great deal . the carry case that come with it be great look and very functional , although I do not use it as like I say before - it fit in my pc case with ease . bottom line , if you need something that to use for powerpoint presentation and travels in the same case as you notebook , this be the one . it be easy to connect , it turn on and shut down super fast , and it auto correct its positining in a smart way . for the clarity and size , it be worth more than $ 500 . if you do not care about the size , there be many other option that will not be as loud as this one .
Projector	POS	5	finally , a projector that deliver on all front - I travel a lot in my role as a erp solution consultant and this projector be a must have . image quality be exceptional - that include the extra feature justify the higher price tag -lrb- have say that , I do not think this projector be overprice at all -rrb- . even in a room with standard office light the picture be very clear and text be also clear and sharp -lrb- this be often where cheaper model fall down -rrb- - brightness and contrast exceptional . I be not experience the noise issue that other reviewer be report - the fan be not obtrusive and be quieter than a lot of other projector that I have use . the light weight and size be perfect for true portability . the construction be by no means flimsy - very solid and robust . my aaa + + + purchase of the year .
Projector	POS	5	I have to write a review for this amazing product . I purchase my Qumi in August , so I have have enough time to play around with it and give a honest review . the picture quality be just amazing . I use to have a older Sanyo pj that be just standard def . replacement bulb for my Sanyo pj be $ 500 each ouch !!! the qumus seem like it be light year ahead of its time when I first see the image on my screen . the qumus do have to warm up for a few minute before the focus be clear . it be nothing major with 30,000 lamp life , if the few minute it take to focus bother anyone that much you can just leave this wonderful device on all the time -lrb- in eco mode -rrb- and you will never have to worry about the focus issue . sometimes I leave my qumus on for hour at a time because I do not have to worry about a bulb !!!! when I do leave it on for long period of time I simply switch from normal mode to eco mode and when I be ready to watch again turn normal mode back on and I be experience eye candy !! my wife like the pj also because it really do look like a oversize hdtv . I do have my Qumi in a dark basement , but I can leave on a couple of light -lrb- away from the screen -rrb- and the picture be bright enough . my brightness be not even all the way up it be like at 60 -lrb- can go to 100 -rrb- . as far as 3d be concern the qumus can put out a 3d image with extra hardware of course , but the qumus can do it . I watch Drive Angry 3d and the picture brightness be kind of dark , but in a dark environment the picture be still bright enough to enjoy a 3d movie . the qumus be a great product and the selling point for I be no more bulb to buy ! just turn on sit back and enjoy . you do not even have to worry about fall asleep with this many hour on the bulb . you could run this projector for 24 hour a day 7 day a week for 4 year before the bulb show any sign of fail . that be just wonderful ! fortunately , no one will run they Qumi for that long so therefore , you Qumi will last you for at least 10 year use it like you would you regular tv . hopefully by then the Qumi will be cheaper and I can have one in every room that use to have a hdtv . the future be look 300 lumen brighter , thanks qumus for a great product . I would recommend this product to anyone look for a economical way of enjoy hd on a huge screen .
Projector	POS	5	this cable trasmitt we pc signal and sound to a flat screen tv about 40 foot away with no problem . there be no signal issue and we be enjoy the option to view we digital content on the tv . the cable be rugged and feel like it be well make . I would purchase this item again with no regret .
Projector	NEU	3	I like this projector for its size . 8oz be so small , easy to carry , and fit anywhere . everything that come with it be great , and it come quickly . initially , it have a large , sharp picture . however , soon after receive it , dead pixel begin to appear to the point it be unusable . currently , it be be fix under its warranty . sorry I can not give any more information as to how that turn out ...
Projector	NEG	1	impress by review i get this projector but very disappointing ... it have scratch all over the body cover more than that project get over heated and get switch off every 10 min : -lrb- : -lrb- : -lrb-
Projector	POS	5	the projector be awesome for power point and work presentation . we be a small school and do not need to spend in excess for a major piece of equipment .
Projector	POS	4	look for a bright , portable , quiet projoector ? this be it . great keystone control and color depth and brightness . only downside -- zoom effect be highly lack . do not expect to shrink or enlarge the image much once you have the projector set up . but for the money -- perfect projector .
Projector	POS	5	this be my fourth projector and my second unit use a DLP chip . I can easily see rainbow in single chip dlp projector but this one almost completely eliminate they . I can still see a few rainbow , especially when there be bright object in a mostly dark scene , but it be hardly noticeable to I and none of my friend have be able to see they yet . if you be one of the few people who be bother by the rainbow effect , you may still want to demo this projector before purchase it online . I be originally use a gray screen in a light-controlled media room but the black with the darkchip3 be so good I move to a Stewart Filmscreen studiotek130 screenwall and the picture be spectacular . I recommend use a white screen with this unit . there be no gap between pixel or mirror dimple so the image be silky smooth . after calibrate with dve , the color be incredible . Colors pop , black be black and whites be white . Optoma have a zero dead pixel policy and a nice warranty . they also offer affordable -lrb- cheap , imo -rrb- extend warranty and upgrade service plan to meet you need . if you be in the market for a top-of-the-line single chip dlp projector , I honestly do not think you can get much better than this .
Projector	POS	4	Easy to use , fun for both inside and out . we use it for the WII and movie . Picture quality be like go to the movie , not hd . still , we watch most movie on this projector . Great for kid 's sleepover . my only issue be the sound level . it need on external speaker jack so you can place speaker in front . may be hard to hear when you sit in front of projector . I would definately recommend this for outdoor fun viewing .

Projector	POS	5	we need a projector pronto on one of my project . I volunteer to order one , and really find a good deal at Electronics Expo . good price , fast shipping , and very good quality product for a reasonable price . will use this seller again .
Projector	NEG	1	the VIVITAR 5000 arrive with the inner , MANUFACTURERS BOX , UNPROTECTED FROM the outer SHIPPING CARTON . both carton be intact ; HOWEVER , I assume it WAS drop very hard from a CONSIDERABLE HIGHT ... three of the four lens in the projector be knock OUT of THEIR BRACKETS and LOOSE in the VIVITAR ASSEMBLY RENDERING the projector completely inoperative . contact the shipper BROUGHT IMMEDIATE STATEMENT that it would be pick up at MY HOME ASAP BY UPS for RETURN and the send of a new unit .

Projector	POS	5	I finally get around to remodel the bedroom and do a little over and beyond the `` honey do list '' . since we be remodel , my wife finally agree to a tv in the bedroom but do not want any wire , amp , speaker , ect . in the room to clutter up the new clean look . so I hang a flat panel with this Yamaha ysp-1100 under it . -lrb- I highly recommend the wall bracket for a application like this -rrb- . the sub be hide in a undisclosed location and yes I hide the wire . step 1 complete . step 2 require I to make it work and make it easy . the auto-calibration feature be a snap . my bedroom be rectangular and the ysp-1100 sound amazing ! there be sound come from all around the room but look honey , `` no speaker '' . I program it be `` my Beam '' feature and so when one of we nod off , the other can still watch tv and not get the `` can you turn it down '' line . well it pass inspection from the Executive Director of the Interior aka the Mrs ! bottom line , it sound amazing , look cool and I highly recommend it . in fact , now my condo-livin ' brother-in-law want one and yep , it be be add to he `` honey do list '' .
Projector	POS	5	I use this to install a hc1500 mit . projector and I could not be happier with the product . it be very heavy duty , and have many adjustment . I can not think of a way it could be better .
Projector	POS	5	buy this in a hurry 14 month ago . over 2000 hour on the lamp so far . great picture for nightly movie with dinner . foreign film , comedy , everything play well for a family of film buff . Easy size adjust for various aspect ratio . lack focus control on remote , but fine for we ceiling mount .
Projector	POS	5	we old projector die , but the carosel slide holder be still good . they match the new projecter perfectly .
Projector	NEG	1	this projector need a lot of darkness in the room . the focus on it be very sensitive also . you basically get what you pay for , do not have high expectation for this device .
Projector	POS	5	I love this video projector ... for a incredible price it be turn my family room into a movie theater ! when I put CHICAGO in the dvd player and see it project by the InFocus x1 , I know I have what I would want all my life ... my own theater !! the clarity and color be absolutely amazing on my 84-inch diagonal screen .
Projector	NEG	1	we purchase a BenQ pb 6100 projector . if the overall quality of the projector be fine , such be not the case of the lamp which blow up in less than 6 week !!! and worse benq do NOT honor they international guarantee and the support center do not respond to the email for exchange the lamp -lrb- price 400 $ ! -rrb- . overall a very poor support . my last boxlight lamp be still run after 4 year . this be my first benq but surely the last . a strong suggestion , do not buy BenQ .
Projector	POS	5	so far I have have my projector for about a week and it work perfectly . I buy this know the cost and not expect the performance I would get from a $ 1000 projector . I assume anyone look to buy this do not have 500-2000 dollar to spend and just want a projector on a budget . so far this be it . I buy a refurbish one and get it ship for $ 230 . I have be use it everyday about 9-12 hour as a second monitor . it come with a extra bulb and all the cable list in the description . the cable and power cord be short so unless you plan on have it close get a longer cable . it say 800x600 but I have mine set at 1024x768 and it accept the signal use vga cord but anything over and the screen turn blue and say no signal . I try s-video hdtv out on my card but nothing display right unless I put it to 480 . I plan to get a vga to hdmi adapter and try the hdmus input on the projector . I hope then it will display 1080 without it be scramble . I hook up coaxial with expand cable tv and run the scan . it pick up the station but it must have the old style because none of the hd in between station work -lrb- ex-10 .1,10.2 -rrb- . some of the station be wrong and i would have to go under each one to manually adjust the frequency to get the right channel and get the clearest picture . also have to set the sound to the right kind to get that to work . I then try a antenna and nothing work so you will need a converter box to get those channel . I have spend much time tweaking the contrast ect . on the projector and my graphic card to get the picture right . the keystone adjustment be just up and down so you need to project straight parallel . the picture size depend on distance from screen so i recommend a ceiling mount so you do not have to have it setup on a table in the middle of the room . it have adjustment for both ceiling -lrb- flip -rrb- and rear -lrb- reversed -rrb- mode . for pixel and clarity I have mine setup about 9ft away with a screen size of almost 6ft wide and about 5ft tall . from 3 1\/2 foot and closer it have a obvious look through a screen effect . the pixel size with my screen size be 1\/16 inch square . right now i just project on a white wall and look good from 5ft back and beyond . my dislike be ; 1 . the fan be loud 2 . it have blank on the input side for usb , scart and card reader . I assume in the next model those input will be put in but its a bummer not have they in this model and see the spot for they . 3 . I have a longer vga cable but with the location of the input on the projector -lrb- cover be too close -rrb- the screw be not long enough on the one side tighten it in . overall I recommend this to whoever want a projector but can not spend over $ 300 . what convinced I to buy this be the fact bulb be 30-40 dollar and last 4000-6000hr . I could have spend $ 250 on a use projector that blow this one away in picture quality and spec but then I would be stick pay $ 200-300 every 3000hr on a new fixture . what I want be a huge picture I can use as much as a tv and not have to ration out the hour i put on the bulb . if you have any question feel free to comment and I hope my review help . just remember if you want perfect quality expect to pay for it , do not fool yourself into think this can compete with a $ 600 + projector .
Projector	POS	5	I set this up last night . I make no change to the color . my wife , son and he friend each be blow away by the better picture than we have with we Sony . brightness be a key issue for we as we screen be 215 inch diagonal .
Projector	POS	4	if you be in a situation where you have ambient light , or a large screen to fill this projector fit the bill . the important part be the six segment color wheel . a lot of dlp projector with this type of light output will cheat and use a seven segment wheel . the Seventh segment be white . that increase the brightness but wash out the color and ruin the contrast . those that be sensitive to DLP `` Rainbows '' will be very happy with the image quality . the projector support vertical and horizontal lens shift -lrb- critical for properly align the picture to the screen -rrb- , however it be a manual stick on the front of the project . zoom and focus be also manual by move two large ring around the lens . the build quality of the case be middle of the road , which be fine for fixed installation , but I would not recommend travel with it . give the price point of thousand less than compete projector those be fair compromise .
Projector	POS	4	every thing work . it do not need to be SDHC , regular sd can work also . it be very light , clear and the battery seem last quite some time . rca out work fine also . I do not have iphone so I do not test it . only con be the speaker be really bad and hard to understand what it be talk about . luckily my wife only need it for photo .
Projector	NEU	3	we do not have a television anymore , just a dvd player and we computer . the 3M Pocket Projector be great for we purpose - we can set it up anywhere and watch a show on any blank wall -lrb- or ceiling , or a cheapie cardboard screen if the wall be occupy -rrb- . the picture be a little dim in light room -lrb- to be expect -rrb- and of the four volume setting I find level 3 be a bit too soft and level 4 be a bit too loud in we 10x12 room , but that be minor . we camera tripod fit perfectly , and there be a jack for standard headphone for when my munchkin want to watch something for the umpteenth time that I just cant stand to listen to anymore . love it ! four and a half star ! - 09\/30\/11 Edited to add : I have have this unit for a year , and unfortunately now it overheat and shut down if the volume be turn above level 2 . the laptop do not always recognize that it be there either . not terribly convenient anymore , since we need three electrical outlet to watch a movie : dvd player , projector , external speaker . downgrade to three star .
Projector	POS	4	this be a pretty good value for the price . I wish it have focus on the remote -lrb- it be manual on the lamp -rrb- and I really wish the picture would scroll down smaller -lrb- it be too big for my screen from across the room -rrb- but it work properly , have good color , clear picture , and be easy to set up . vent get quite warm , pay attention to the warning label . good compact product . fast shipping from Amazon .
Projector	POS	5	this be my first projector mount , and will likely be my last . I be very hesitant to install a mount to begin with , my handyman skill be somewhat lack , but I really need to get my projector up and out of the way . I use this with a Epson 8350 . install the bracket onto the projector be a breeze , as be install the mount into the ceiling . the fine tuning of the positioning of the projector in the mount take a little time , but only because of my `` OCD '' . the adjustment screw hold the projector firmly in position and I have have zero issue with vibration or have to re-adjust the mount . for the price , this mount simply can not be beat imho .
Projector	POS	5	it be much more powerful than I expect . I like the size . it be too bad HP discontinue this model .
Projector	NEG	2	I buy a pc last year with the nVidia 3d system , it come with a Samsung monitor and it look fantastic . I instantly think `` i need a bigger screen '' so I go to nVidia 's page to view compatible display . the Optoma hd66 be and still be list as be compatible an support . so I buy one ... well guess what ? it be neither compatible or currently support . if you search the nvidium page you will find that if you hd66 be build before August of 2010 -lrb- that be right , August of 2010 ! -rrb- it will not work . I then call Optoma tech support and be tell by the phone tech that in order for it to work , it have to be send back to the factory for modification and that I would be responsible for the shipping ... I tell the guy that that be outrageous and I would simply return it and get something that actually do work as advertise . in case you wonder , I purchase the Acer h5360 . . I should have purchase it the first time around , not only do the 3d work flawlessly , it have way more feature than the hd66 like `` auto keystone , auto orientation , color wall compensation '' to name a few . if you look for a 3d projector that really deliver , you can wait two month till the actually compatible hd66 's hit the street -lrb- and hope they work -rrb- or you can get the Acer h5360 . of course deal with Amazon be the only way to go , the return of the hd66 be simple and I be enjoy real 3d in my living room on the Acer .
Projector	POS	5	do not get I wrong , there be room for improvement but for the price tag this little projector deliver . let 's start with the sound , I agree this projector do not have audio out , but this be not a issue with I , when use hdmus with my laptop because you can use smart audio software to disable the projector audio and send the sound straight to you laptop speaker or external speaker plug in to you laptop . I have Windows 7 and use a p500 Toshiba satellite laptop . I be able to connect this use a hdmus cable to both my DIRECTV HD receiver and laptop w\/hd and get 1080i picture with a 100 + '' 16:9 widescreen within approximately a 15 to 17 foot distance . if you can afford something more expensive I would say go for it , if you be look for true 720p or 1080p hd . however if you be on a tight budget this little projector be great and the picture do not disappoint even for hd . I be so happy I settle for this and do not spend so much more to get a hd -lrb- label -rrb- projector . this be very portable and I be use a regular camera tripod as a stand , and the whole experience be just awesome .
Projector	NEG	1	just like another person say , this product be garbage . I buy the 120 ft screen . I install it -lrb- pay someone to do this -rrb- and roll it down to start view a picture on it . the screen look great and I be happy until it be time to roll it back up . the retract mechanism do not work and my screen wont roll up no matter what I try . now Amazon want I to pay to ship this back and its look like it will cost a fortune due to its size . such a headache !!!!!!!!
Projector	NEG	1	the whole part be solid except the screw , shame when a screw break inside the connect plastic side of the projector , it ruin everything .
Projector	NEU	3	we need it the same day it arrive and we be able to use it without hardly look at direction , so ease of use good . but the clarity of a power point we load be not as good as we have hope . be not like the crisp demo they have load on it when it arrive .
Projector	POS	4	I love the picture quality . I hate the lack of internal memory . it would be far better if they have more . I have have to get a mini sd card to add what it lack . other than that it be great to have here in afghanistan .
Projector	POS	5	this be my second projector , and this one have much better feature . it have everything you need to watch a movie anywhere , all you need be some power . it have a lot of option to adjust the screen to adapt to any viewing location . it come with a travel case so that it stay well protect in transit .
Projector	POS	5	this be a excellent business class lcd projector that be easy to use right out of the box . the Epson be plug-and-play for pc , -lrb- mac require a driver installation -rrb- use either a VGA or usb connection . the usb cable be not include . there be also a composite video input as well . the projection be bright and clear , with vibrant color , even in partially light room , which make it ideal for business use . Powerpoint animation look good , and photographic background appear clearly define in medium light . the projector resolution be 1024x768 , which be standard resolution , and not widescreen , but since most screen roll out longer than they be wide , and many business environment be still use standard definition , this should not be a problem . the unit be reasonably light weight and compact , and have most feature that the average business user would need for presentation in the boardroom or on the road . even dvd movie be project pretty good , but not as well as presentation slide in medium to brightly light room . I would not recommend this projector for home movie view - there be better projector on the market specifically design for that . however , in it be class , I think this be a extremely well perform lcd projector .
Projector	POS	5	we order this because we older tv finally give out on we . I have to say that I be extremely pleased with this product . if there be some light in the room the picture be still very good . I would not say hd quality but it be a projector what do you expect . in a dark room hook up to we hd box the image project on we plain wall be better than the hd tv we buy a couple year ago !! it really be a great product . I imagine that with a screen behind it during the day would make the quality of the picture better . I would recommend this to anyone . for the price especially you can not beat it .
Projector	POS	4	I have have this for over two month now . the picture be a little lighter than I would like during the day -lrb- we have big window in the house -rrb- , but in the evening it look spectacular . we just project onto a white wall and it feel like we be in a movie theater . the volume be adequate for we living room , but it could have be a little louder . I also like that you can just insert a dvd and it power on by itself . this have make watch movie much more enjoyable , and it look better than the more expensive tv of friend that I have see because the picture be larger . I would give it 5 star if this be the whole story . the other day , it start make a beeping noise . another reviewer complain about this . it beep incessantly , like one beep every three seconds , and it be loud enough that it effect the audio . right now other people be in my living room watch a movie that I want to watch that I absolutely can not watch because the beeping be on my nerve . I be try to watch it on instant view on Netflix via the computer . I have do this before without a problem . one of the reason for get this projector be that we could hook the laptop up to it and project . it be work great for picture thus far . but it be beep the other day with the laptop , and it be beep today . so far , I have not notice beep with a regular dvd , but it do beep when a camera be hook up to it . this absolutely should not happen to technology this sophisticated . it sound very similar to the beeping that happen when the power be turn off and on . what a terrible idea to begin with . why create a machine that can beep at all in the first place ? it beep once it be turn on . it be not do it as some kind of warning , or because it be too hot . it have rest for over 24 hour . it be do it because there be a flaw in the machine itself . I be go to find my warranty and either get this replace , fix or return . it be really a shame because it be a cost-effective and nice machine otherwise . why give thing the capacity to beep that do not need to beep ? update : the next time I use it with the computer , it do not beep at first , but I have to stop it for something , and then it start beep again . I let it rest for about five day before watch another film via Netflix , and even some youtube astronomy video -lrb- which look beautiful by the way -rrb- and I do not have any beeping problem . I hope the beeping disappear , and I will call customer service if happen again . overall , I love the thing , assume that the beeping problem can be take care of . second update : still beep over a month later . consistently . I be extremely disappointed . final UPDATE : thanks to a great two year warranty , I be able to get the problem fix . they replace the light , and it seem to be work fine . they say that this problem be a rarity .
Projector	POS	5	buy for Iraq deployment ... awesome 5 ' + screen on the wall of my CHU -lrb- trailer -rrb- . definitely need external speaker\/headphones , but in a darkened room the picture be great .
Projector	POS	5	this clock do it all . love the ocean sound and be able to see the time on the ceiling . I realize that all this be not necessary but for the price you can not beat it . my daughter in law love it and order one too .
Projector	NEU	3	just remember , u get what you pay for . it be a cmo , not ccd . just wish u could take a picture and not video only .
Projector	POS	4	first , let I say , I would have give this projector 4.5 star if the rating be available . basically , it be a really good projector . it have everything you need , and the picture quality and brightness be really good . however , this unit be really big and not just a little ugly . I mean , I suppose the picture quality be the primary objective , but could not they have make it just a little prettier ? it do not actually look that much worse than other unit in shape , etc. . but it be huge , which make the utilitarian appearance stand out . also , it be white . which mean that if you want to use it as part of a home theater setup like I , it be more visible in a dark room . ugly and more visible make a bad combination . I be really happy with my projector . I be sure I 'll get a lot of use and satisfaction from it . but the first thing that go through my mind everytime I look at it be : `` wow ! that be a big , ugly projector ! ''
Projector	POS	4	the light blow out on my projector . this product be exactly as specify and just what I need . quick delivery time . thank you
Projector	POS	5	I be a little tentative before buy this projector due to the 800 x 600 svga picture , but I be pleasantly surprise that the picture be fantastic . it be bright and vivid , even with some ambient lighting . it do lack a hd input , but as another reviewer -lrb- blaser -rrb- note , you can get around this for less than $ 15 . buy a  VGA to RCA Component RGB Cable - 1.8 m - m\/m  if you need a hdmus input , this will do the trick :  VGA to HDMI Cable M\/M , 6 FT , Black -lrb- Video Card support necessary -rrb-  with these cheap accessory , you can use this projector for 100 '' screen gaming , tv and movie watching , and even computing . as a additional note , we use ours for work seminar and have it run all day with no heating issue .
Projector	POS	5	I be look for a projector to show Harry Potter for my son birthday and to watch movie outdoors this summer and my brother , who also own this model , say to try this one out because he love it . well he be right . the picture in a dark room be incredible . we have show it on the wall and on the EPSON DUET projector screen -lrb- which be pretty cool too -rrb- . we have watch the final four -lrb- from a dish network receiver -rrb- , Shrek 4 -lrb- from a Samsung Blue Ray Player -rrb- , Legends of the Guardian -lrb- from the PS3 -rrb- , and Tron -lrb- from a dish network receiver -rrb- . the color be all incredible and the black level be great . the only minor issue I have be that the projector would not find my Samsung Blue Ray player with a 25 ft hdmus cable , but it would with a 10 ft cable . not a projector issue I be sure as the 25 ft cable work with the projector and the PS3 . in a well light room the projector look okay -lrb- obviously not as good as when the room be dark -rrb- . with a little light filter into the room , the projector still look really good . I also adjust setting accord to one of the other review and it seem to make the picture even better than it look out of the box -lrb- which be still really good -rrb- . if you need a great little projector at a great little price , go for it .
Projector	POS	5	I live in a condo and have no room for a 100 '' permanent screen . I have a nice tv and surround sound setup , but for special movie or event I want a BIG picture . so I buy this screen with the intention of put it in front of my tv when need . this way I can still sit on my couch and still have my speaker orient correctly , etc. . some of the review scare the heck out I . -lrb- damaged arrival , etc -rrb- . Mine be package very well . first I have to remove tie wrap that hold cardboard corner edge on all 4 side ; much like a molding that run down the entire length of the box . then , I open the box to find another box inside that one ! open the inner box reveal foam wrap material and foam corner . the screen be inside this . it be in perfect condition ! the only criticism I can see be that it be not 100 % flat . but roll up\/down screen never be . I watch a movie , play some PS3 , and the lack of perfect flatness be not noticeable to I . in all , I love the purchase ! I consider give it 4 star since it be not `` perfectly flat '' , but then give it 5 because its not fair to expect that and more importantly it be not noticeable .
Projector	POS	4	do not pay attention to the review suggest that the bulb be a hassle . this be a good product , and I think I know what happen with he . the first bulb probably have a problem , and that be why Toshiba replace it at no cost . but if he install the next bulb incorrectly , the lifespan be shorten exponentially , so be sure to do it right . and as for the price of the bulb , they be expensive , but he be exaggerate just a bit . I just buy one on the internet a week ago for $ 260 -lrb- tax free -rrb- and it be already here . as for I , I use my projector extensively , probably 5-7 hour a day . it last about a year and a half for I , which be more than I think it would . all in all , this be much better than a big screen t.v. , and cheaper ... good buy .
Projector	POS	5	this be my second pj and I love it . it be smaller and brighter than the hc1500 I have . I want a 3d set up so I buy this along with the 3dxl and it have be a amazing experience . watch bluray be kick ass !! and play PS3 in 3D be too much !!! best purchase I have make in a looooooong time . - Abel Z.
Projector	POS	5	this be the first projestor we have own but we be very impressed and can not imagine how the picture coutl get better .
Projector	NEU	3	I get the product relatively quickly and it work as intend however I think if this be sell as a universal mount it should come with way more assortment of screw and washer\/spacers in order to accomodate most projector . also the joint could use some lock washer in order to prevent they from move under weight .
