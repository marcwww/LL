HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	it have be a long and arduous journey for I to find a home theater system that meet two simple expectation . when I finally find this system it not only meet those simple expectation , it blow they away . this be the third system that I have purchase , the other -lrb- a Sony and a Kenwood -rrb- be not pass muster . my first expectation be that the sound system should work , and the Kenwood fail here when its Subwoofer stop work in a literal cloud of smoke . my second expectation be that it should sound good , and this be where the Sony fail . this onkyo system sound so much better than those other model in the $ 300 to $ 350 price range that I would gladly pay twice that after have to set-up and return two system . the package be deliver by freight -lrb- for Free by Crutchfield , whom I also recommend -rrb- and it be a large , heavy box . the receiver have some real heft to it , and appear to be very well make . the speaker be much larger than the standard fare with home theater system right now , and you will be glad they be once you hear they . there be six speaker in total , include three surround . the subwoofer have a powerful ten inch driver that will really add reinforcement to action movie and good soundtrack . there be 1000 watt in total go to all seven speaker . this be a setup that be better suit for a larger room , mine be about 15 ' by 30 ' . it would probably overpower a room that be not big enough . the system itself be a little complicated to figure out but have many feature . there be a build in crossover for the subwoofer that can be set from 80-150hz , and the volume can be adjust for each speaker . Make sure you have a optical cable from to connect the dvd player to it to fully take advantage of 6.1 surround . one of the most important aspect of a system be have a well design remote control . the remote control for this unit be a little large , but the button be spread out and illuminate for ease of use , although I have not yet figure out what they all do . this system also have the ability to play a stereo signal through all of its speaker , something the Sony and Kenwood system could not do . the Onkyo will also take a 5.1 signal and convert it to a 6.1 signal by blend the left\/right rear signal together into a rear center signal . there be also a `` late night '' feature that will make quiet noise louder and the loud noise softer so that you can listen to a movie quietly and still hear everything , among other feature that I have not yet get around to discover . be warn , this system be not the easiest to set up or to operate , but the result can not be deny . it work . it sound good . buy it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	ok its not as good as the bose system , but for the fraction of the price it be good . I really can not tell the difference between mine system and my brother bose which cost 1500 dollar more without a dvd player . if you have super sensitive ear and you loaded get the `` bose system '' if you look for a dvd\/audio theater system that sound great , play cd , dvd and really look good too , get the panasonic
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I order this system because I want to put new speaker on my exist surround sound system . read the review on Amazon , I expect the subwoofer to be weak -lrb- it be -rrb- , but I expect the speaker to be good to excellent . they be fair . this be actually the first item in my multi-year history as a Amazon shopper that I be go to the trouble to return . the speaker system I order for my computer sound better . if you just need a cheap system that be better than the speaker on you tv , this might be good for you . otherwise , shop around and maybe spend just a little more .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	this system have no digital input , so if you want to use it with a xbox or a PlayStation 2 for dolby\/dts playback , you be out of luck .  consider yourself warn .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this product be a great value . I watch x-man 2 last night and the sound be incredible . it be easy to install , but if you have a cable box be sure to use the direction come with the cable box because the direction that come with the unit be poor -lrb- just a diagram that show EVERY type of configuration on one page -rrb- . also , the sub-woofer come with a annoying sticker on it that take 1\/2 a hour to get off . I highly recommend this unit for sound quality and price .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	set up could not be easier ... right out-of-the-box . assembly be simple and connection be clearly describe . if you have the Panasonic HD tv with arc and Blu-Ray , no problem . you will need to have 3 hdmus cable : -lrb- 2 -rrb- output - from you cable box or satellite box and disc player to the subwoofer and one for the output from the subwoofer to the ARC connection on you tv . no arc ? check out the other review . the sound be a amazing improvement from the tv speaker . watch avatar on Blu-Ray and the sound and picture just blow I away . if you have a small to medium size room , this system be for you . no hesitation on the 5 star .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	First off , let I say that I be satisfied with the system . it be not go to rattle the window or wake the neighbor - but for ordinary movie watch with clear sound effect it be a good value . I have have this system for about 8 month and very seldom use the dvd . last night we purchase lose in translation and the dvd skip during the preview , then the player refuse to load the dvd after I eject and clean the disc . long story short , I hack the system accord to matta2k 's instruction later in this message board and now it work perfectly . we 'll see if I be still satisfy at the end of the year .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I happy to have it ! it be work and look like new . very good item especially for such price .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	my family buy the RCA blu-ray rtb1100 during the after-thanksgiving sale . we get it all hook up only to have the blu-ray player freeze up multiple time . we exchange it for another one . again the blu-ray player freeze up in the middle of the movie . we try different blu-ray and dvd and the same thing happen . we be very frustrated and will be replace it with another brand .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this to replace a LG fd-790 vintage 2007 which die . I want Blu-Ray so buy this instead of fix the LG . I consider another LG but read all the bad review about the wireless rear speaker not work so pass . I be a Amazon Prime subscriber and want something that could stream instant video as my tv be a lg 47lbx which be not internet ready . I do not want a separate boxee type thing or htpc because of technology issue of another family member and tv watcher . the good thing be it all work and be relatively easy to setup . the bad thing for I be : 1 I try to register for my Sony Essentials account but it turn out that if you already have a sonystyle.com online account it be the same thing so I lock my exist account try to register . this result in a extended phone wait and multiple transfer to have my account reset . then streaming work . 2 I install the MediaRemote for Android by Sony on my Samsung Infuse and it work except the Network Services function have a place for username and password but no way to navigate to the password at least not on my phone . 3 as mention in other review there be no equalizer . my wife say the bass boom too much . I have it set to -6 db which be as turn down as it go . I may have to put a pillow under it or something . I know other have comment on the poor bass response of the other speaker but no complaint on that . I have try the various audio mode but none of they seem to cut the subwoofer volume relative to other speaker or frequency response much . 4 program the radio preset be a pain and non-intuitive but it work and I hope to never do it again
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this unit from Amazon about 6 month ago . I must admit , this be a very stylish system with very low profile . the dvd player itself be very very slim . it be wider than normal component though . sound be pretty decent . I have not have any problem with the sound . some folk have complain about the subwoofer be weak . but in my setup it be deliver robust and rich bass . I think this unit be not mean to be in a very big room . in small room sound be great . the remote feel flimsy . I be scared one day may 20 month old daughter be go to break it and my system will be unusable . sometimes the button need to be press hard . and since there be no indicator lead on the remote , you can not tell if the button get press or not . little annoying . it do not play dvd-rw or dvd + rw . I think this day and age all dvd player need to handle the above format .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I be please with the the video and audio quality of this system . however , the 5-disc tray take a long time to load\/rotate and the dvd player be very picky . it would not play some of the dvd I purchase overseas -lrb- ntsc & region-free -rrb- that play fine in my other , less expensive , dvd player .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	do not buy this unit . there be a problem with it over heating and cause a loud poping sound after a couple hour of use . I talk with Panasonic about this and they will not admit to the problem , however , you can find several other people that have have the same problem on the net .  when ask for replacement unit , I be tell that I would have to take it to my local repair center to have a tech look at the unit . this unit be still under warrenty and it be go to take several day for the unit to be repair . no sound or dvd while this take place . I will never buy another Panasonic unit again , to bad because this be the best unit I find on the market . Guess next time I 'll pay the extra money and get a Sony ! at least they care about they customer .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I purchase this product , along with a Samsung 55 '' lcd tv and Logitech Harmony one . I love it !! Samsung be make amazing product with great price point . because I go from a 27 '' tube tv with no ss , I be still in shock from the amazing picture and sound my new set up be put out . one recommendation I would make be to purchase a Logitech remote also . go from 4 remote controll to 1 be amazingly easy and reduce clutter . I be by no means electronically knowledgable but be able to set up the tv , surround sound system and remote in about 3 hour ! my only complaint be the blu-ray player do not always `` tune '' to the right setting when go from `` watch dvd '' to `` watch cable '' . this be easily fix by go through the help menu on the Logitech -lrb- take about 5 button push -rrb- . overall , I be completely satisfy with what Samsung have provide , customer service be so helpful and be able to trouble shoot via internet chat be very nice , no holding on the phone !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be very happy with this purchase . have check around at a lot of place and find nothing this good for the price !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	do not buy this product . the input in the back of the receiver do not work and will not work . i have it replace twice already and both have the same problem , so i be think its the product that be defective . i have a wius , xbox and ps3 and when i plug it in the back input system , only the audio work , but not the video . there be no video display in the tv . i have even call Sony customer service dept and they could not help I . they even tell I its because i have a sony bravium hdmus hdtv , that the high definition be not set correctly , but when i try it on my other tv , the sony trinitron regular crt tv , it do not work either . so the system be defective when it come to input receiver , other than this , the product deliver awesome sound that be very impressive .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I buy this unit in January 2006 from bbuy . I admit I be mainly look for a surround sound system but the price seem reasonable and with all the other feature -lrb- 5-disc changer , divx capable , etc. -rrb- I think what the heck . at first I do not really use the dvd player that much , but when I do I have a problem with a few disc skip after about a hour into the movie , at the time I just figure the disc themselves be bad , like I say I do not use it to watch many movie . well recently my wife start work at a movie rental store , so with free rental we have start watch a lot more movie . now I see that the dvd function on this unit be basically useless , pretty much every movie we play begin to skip and then freeze at about a hour and fifteen minute into the movie . I know it be not the disc , sometimes she get free unopened movie as promotional item and the same thing happen , a hour and fifteen minute or so into the movie it begin to skip , every single time now . I have try disc cleaner with no luck . after some research online , it seem that alot of people have the same exact problem with all type of samsung dvd player . maybe there be just a few bad unit float around out there but nonetheless I would recommend go with another brand .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	ok , maybe I be on a little bit of a `` jihad '' here against these up-converting dvd player , but bear with I because I do have a valid point . do not buy any dvd player because it can `` up-convert to hd '' . evaluate all dvd player on whether they do everything else well , or have the connection you need -lrb- DVI , HDMI , etc. -rrb- or the price be in you budget . this may be a fine dvd player , but do not buy it just because it can up-convert , and do not use the up-convert capability of this player even if you do buy it . if you tv can accept 720p or higher input via DVI or HDMI , then it be already scale the image to fit the native resolution of the display device . and I guarantee you it be do a better job of it than any sub-200 dollar dvd player be go to do . -lrb- if not , then you hdtv be poorly make -rrb- . my final point : if this up-coverting technology be such a good idea , why be Samsung the only one do it ? why not Pioneer , Panasonic , Sony , JVC , and Denon ? -lrb- because they know it be usless technology -rrb- .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I do not know much about sound system and already have 5 speaker set up for surround sound use a Onkyo receiver . I expect to be able to plug everything in to the receiver and have 7.1 surround but that be not the case . if you do not have a receiver , you can plug the two speaker into the subwoofer and the subwoofer into the tv and you better sound than if you just have the tv speaker . however , if you be like I , the jack on the subwoofer can not plug into the port on the receiver . thus , I have 7 speaker for lovely surround sound with not bass . still , speaker look very nice in front of my tv and I have the connect as one long shiny black bar . you also have the option of stand they up on either side of you tv as show in the picture .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	after a long review other product , this be the best , the price , the function and option be great . we connect the blue-ray -lrb- hdmus in -rrb- , set-top box -lrb- hdmus in -rrb- , netbook -lrb- hdmus in -rrb- and internet radio -lrb- logitech , via optical in -rrb- , and it work without any problem , video go to a lead tv , if you want to watch something -lrb- hdmus out -rrb- . the only thing to check be the installation of the three speaker box : one front soundbar -lrb- with 3 speaker , 3 cable -rrb- , 2 surround and 1 subwoofer , after finish it , and the hdmus connection be ready , all be ok , then , listen the best sound in a really small size
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this unit and i be surprised find out that it have a great audio , nice bass , however it lack treble and bass control . I have to replace the unit due to problem with the power unit a week after I purchase it , now afer 3 month it skip some dvd 's during playback . also , the fan make alot of noise for its size .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I buy this system Xmas 2001 . ... there a few `` nagging item '' I would of like do differently but overall I be very pleased .  the good 1 -rrb- sound great ! the subwoofer & -lrb- 5 -rrb- satellite speaker be nice look & compact . and the output be plenty for we 12 ' x 16 ' room . 2 -rrb- Plays virtually all type of CD 's perfectly . I use dvd , CD-audio , CD-R & CD-RW with MP3s . I have encounter no skip problem . 3 -rrb- I plug my exist CD changer & my HiFi VCR into it be RCA jack . these component be integrate well . 4 -rrb- 5.1 Dolby Digital dvd output . 5 -rrb- dvd playback feature be adequate . Picture quality be perfect -lrb- of course - it be digital -rrb- .  the bad 1 -rrb- no dvd zoom or similar feature I have see on other player . not a real big deal to I ... 2 -rrb- no built-in DTS decoder . again not a big deal to I as Dolby digital kick ! 3 -rrb- it take approx 5 sec to `` read '' a disc before any playback can begin . 4 -rrb- there be no text display for mp3 file & the unit do not `` chapter '' folder the way some unit I have see will . for instance if you have individual album in separate folder , you can not `` chapter '' from folder-to-folder . this unit only skip track although you can type in a `` go-to '' track # .  the ugly 1 -rrb- very slow disc change . I time it at about 12 sec . almost best to consider it a single disc player . 2 -rrb- mp3 playback seem to be limit to a maximum of 160 kbp encode rate . this be annoying to I as I have many recording at 192 + kbps and this unit will jump\/skip at high bit-rate . 3 -rrb- the unit tend to get hot seemingly due to it be `` Energy Star '' compliance that cycle the fan on\/off . I actually return the 1st unit I would purchase think the fan be not work . after get the 2nd one and watch the fan , I realize it cycle . take heed and install in a ventilate area with good air flow !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	while this player recognize and play back dvd-r and dvd-rw , it would stop and stutter at various play point . very annoying . these same disk play in about five other brand I test without stutter -lrb- Pioneer , Apex , Toshiba ... -rrb-  I get this ... open-box item at a north Seattle best buy , but I still have to take it back -- too bad . the price be very good and the surround sound be pretty good .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I think I would give KLH a try base on several review that this company make good gear . this be a big disappointment . these speaker have nothing - they sound like tin can . now you could say you get what you pay for , but I honestly can not find anything nice to say about they . they have no bass , the midrange be muddy - seem like a few octave be simply miss , and the high be loud , but not crisp . the subwoofer be somewhat decent , but its not really 50 watt . it be 25 watt RMS , 50 watt peak . RMS should be the only rating you look at , as it be a more standardized measure of power . I return mine to the store
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	fairly easy to set up to play music , but when it come to hook it up to you tv or gaming system , that be where it can get a bit confusing . nothing I could not figure out though . this system be set up in my bedroom -lrb- 20x20ft -rrb- , it get very loud ; any louder and I would be deaf . the only complaint I have be that I can not get my center speaker to play . I have my ipod hook up and all the other speaker be play except for that one . that be the sole reason for the 4 star review , else it would be 5 star . overall , great sound system .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	my wife and I just move into we first house and after year of live in a cramped apartment , I be finally able to splurge on entertainment product for we living room . while I have do a ton of research for nearly everything else in my set-up , I take a chance on this system and be reasonably happy so far . for whatever reason , I have buy nothing but Samsung product for we living room . 52 '' lcd tv and Blu-Ray player . I figure I would stick to the same name brand for the htib system . on the plus side , the sound quality be pretty solid , especially during sport event . it be really , really nice . music sound fine on it , too . the set-up be fairly painless , as long as you follow the instruction closely . I love that it have 4 hdmus input , which be great since I have a cable box , xbox 360 and Blu-Ray player . it make it far easier to change input , compare to have to navigate HDMI input with the television 's own controller . I be absolutely blow away by the sound of the system when play call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 . fantastic stuff . my living room be a very odd shape and design , and for that reason I be glad this system have the ASC device to balance the sound . Picture if you will a rectangle on its side . my tv be in the upper right corner . a bay window take up nearly the entire right wall . the top\/north wall have a fireplace that jut out . the bottom\/south wall be where one couch be , but the staircase to go up stair be behind it , so there be actually only 1\/2 a wall there . the left\/west wall have a love seat , and the south-left corner lead directly into the kitchen area . that make it incredibly difficult to figure out where exactly to place the speaker . the ASC mic do a pretty good job get the volume level from each speaker balanced . I just wish there be a way to figure out the best speaker position without spend money to have some Geek Squad guy come out to the house . on the downside , the rear speaker be not wireless , although the cable be certainly long enough . when hang on the wall , the speaker also do not have a indentation to run the wire through , so the speaker hang on the wall weirdly . the system can not expand to 7.1 channel , but I know that when I purchase it . the system be fairly new , so my Harmony one remote have to be manually program . this have lead to a few occasion where the avr do not change input , despite repeatedly hit button on the remote . occasionally during commercial on tv , the sound will momentarily drop out for a second or so . I can not explain that one . I be also amaze by the amount of dust the speaker and avr attract . my wife and I keep we house spotless , but dust still find its way to the system and it be hard not to notice it on the shiny surface . despite my best effort , it seem like everything be cover in dust by the end of the day . I also have a Nintendo Wii , which have a composite output , and I still can not figure out how to connect it to the avr . the video input be there for a composite connection , but I be unclear where the audio get plug in . I be not a fan of the ipod connection , either . once you connect a ipod or iPhone , there be no way to select a song or playlist or anything ... the device just play . I have to set the avr to `` Video iPod '' in order to navigate the ipod and play the music\/playlist I want to . a minor annoyance , but a annoyance nonetheless . as this be my first htib , I really enjoy the hw-c560 and I hope to get quite a few good year out of it . that say , my next home theater purchase will be a larger , better set-up that work better with the living room .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I be on my fourth head unit , and this one only work intermittently . dvd do not play , sound cut out , on and on . also , worst remote ever . what be tragic be that while the head unit be clearly a piece of junk , the speaker be all great , and it sound fantastic when it work . now Cambridge be not sell these any more . no surprise .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this item be a great value for the price . the sound be very clear , and I can only turn it up to 3\/4 before it scare the dog . all-in-all , I feel that I get more than what I pay for . another plus -- the set up be very easy .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this definitely be not a professional sound set up if youre look for one . it work alright for my and my friend play music through we laptop , and i plug it into the tv for movie . the sub be not up to par , sound very fake . the whole thing look straight out of the 90 's . not have a separate counsel to point the remote at get old too . the remote they give you control the way the sound come out of the speaker , BUT also happen too be the size of 3 stamp line up . mean I lose it almost daily . sound quality be alright . can get a bit fuzzy when it be louder , and im pretty sure i blow a speaker already too . it be cheap though , so for the money i recommend it . I just learn my lesson to put a little more money in it next time .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	solid unit with a nice universal remote include . good fm receiver , good dvd playback , powerful surround sound . it just `` feel '' like a well-built system . I have see cheaper unit for sale , but I do not regret pay a little extra for something of this quality .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	the system be way better than I expect it to be . be the system be so cheap I be expect something loud , but not clear and i be wrong . everything be so clear , the bass hit perfectly , and you feel fully immerse into movie , game , and anything you watch on tv . I purchase this to go alongside my PS3 and Samsung TV and it work flawlessly with the two . the PS3 will auto sync with the system to output at the best possible setting , and then do so . the only drawback that I can find . it do not come with any hdmus cable so be sure to buy they . the `` out '' on the system be through HDMI so in order for you to have everything hook up to the unit and go to the tv you need hdmus . if you do not have hdmus then you can still run the sound from the tv to the unit , but you will need to manually adjust all the setting on the PS3 etc. . . to suit the output of the unit . the only way to truly experience the full power of the unit and full surround sound clarity you will need HDMI hook up though , so either way . I be only get two channel sound quality when I wasnt use HDMI . if you do not have it setup correctly setting like pro Logic make the rear speaker extremely quiet . however when you go in depth , the unit do offer a microphone adjustment tool . you setup the microphone and it adjust accordinly . its osmething id expect from system costing hundred of dollar more . from what ive mess with I dont think you can go in and adjust the subwoofer though . overall turn up this system sound absolutely phenomonial especially in smaller room , but it excel in larger room too . the nice thing be you can turn it down and still get amazing sound quality , but the sub get quiet and you not wake up neighbor all night . it take less than a half hour to set it up , and since then ive be blow away one way or another . its absolutely worth the price its at , would probably even buy it if it be higher to be honest .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I just receive this theater system yesterday and it be wonderful . I find it very easy to setup , the direction be very easy to follow and understand even if you be not electronically incline . plus the manual be not a 100 page book you have to read to learn how to run the system . < br \/ > < br \/ > I love the design of the system also . Panasonic make the dvd 5 disc changer look really cool by make the front of it look like a mirror . also around the volume knob , it glow with blue light when you turn the system on . the speaker be silver and have a nice design . the tall -lrb- long -rrb- speaker be the front speaker and the smaller one go in the back of the room . the nice thing be that all the speaker be capable of hang on the wall . also , pole that be attach to the tall front speaker -lrb- as show in the picture -rrb- can be use for the back speaker instead if you like . so there be option with this system . < br \/ > < br \/ > the performance of the system be amazing and at the price I get it for , you can `` t go wrong . the dvd player be quick when change disc and quiet . there be also a lot of setup option . you can ajust the subwoofer level from the remote , many different picture view , sound setting for cd 's , and speaker adjustment to name a few . also , there be ton of input for you extra device . I have the VCR and 3 game system hook up to it . I also like the fact that it have the option for component cable hook up for the tv . I buy some of those cable last night and the picture do look better . I love the subwoofer . it be pretty hefty but definately worth it . there be 4 different bass level you can set it on and it be POWERFUL . I put in the chronicle of Riddick and it shake the floor and my cat hide for the rest of the night . you have to be careful though . I live in a apartment and the bass can be hear clearly and heavily outside the apartment and I do not have the volume up very loud at all . but with the subwoofer adjustment , you can find a setting that work best for you . < br \/ > < br \/ > I suggest this product for everyone . it work so great and it be such a good value for the money that I be tell all my friend about it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	great sound with this product . obviously it be not fancy or expensive , but for the price and ease of setup , this be worth it .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	it take I several hour to figure out that the back speaker wire -lrb- and associate plug -rrb- be not attach to the plastic casing that cover the connection port on the speaker . the wire be loose through a hole in that plastic cover\/housing . Vizio could have mention this configuration in the manual , with some sort of easy picture ... but NO. . I think there be some other issue with the unit that I keep try to diagnose . plus , I keep see review and complaint about how the back speaker do not work for some folk . finally , before call they support line -lrb- which I be scare to do -rrb- , I try one last time and luck out to find this configuration . what you need to do be pull some of the wire through the plastic cover\/casing . then , connect the wire\/plug to the back speaker connection , make certain that the plug be secure\/firmly in the outlet . finally , move the plastic cover along the wire and attach the cover to the back of the speaker . TA DA ! it work . it be so stupid and I be so angry for they not be any specific advice about this anywhere -lrb- even on the internet -rrb- . the only thing the manual mention be : the wire to the back speaker may come loose in transport and may need to be reattach . however , the manual do not tell you , specifically , how to reattach that wire . I hope this help those who be have fit , like I do . beyond that , this piece seem to be a pretty good solution and sound pretty good , or at least good enough for my sister : - -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	this system be the next evolution of the ht900 and ht920 . both of which have design flaw . I speak with a panasonic service engineer about the ht900 and he verify a pop noice come from my sub be a know issue with the sub , but no recall be issue . after 3 month of discussion they replace with 920 . after own a little over a year I have issue with the sub on this system also . there local certified repair company tell I there be a issue with the design of the circuit board on this system . different problem from the 900 . they say they though Pansonic would replace but after numerous conversation they do not . they make good tv but low quality home theater in a Box and do not stand behind they product .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	hus we purchase this unit in April , 2005 for almost over $ 400.00 . this unit do not have review by then . we think since we be put good money we get a pretty decent system but the performance be not what we expect . it can not play dvd for more than 2 or 3 hour . after that it continually try to read but unsuccessful . please do not buy this unit at all . try look for a SONY or BOSE if you can afford . lesson learn be beware what you buy and let other write review about the unit then you buy . thanks .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy this product before Christmas and be amaze by the quality . it be under $ 50 ! I must emphasize I have a very small living room and I do not think this would do much in anything bigger . but if you be look for surround sound for you bedroom or a small living room DO IT !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	if you be look for a all-in-one home theater system with all the new goody , then this be definitely the one to look for . at -lrb- $ $ $ -rrb- , it have pro logic ii , a feature not usually find on other system with similar price , which actually convert you normal stereo sound to 5.1 surround -lrb- now my tv sound surround ! -rrb- . it also have progressive scan too , a big plus . it play mp3 , VCD , CD-R\/RW beside dvd . furthermore , the player look very cool with its metallic casing .  on the minus side , the speaker look mediocre like some -lrb- low-end -rrb- computer speaker , but the sound be clear and crisp . the remote that come with it look like -lrb- low-end -rrb- plastic , very unattractive . anyway , what I really care be the numerous function of the remote .  in short , if you be look for a budget home theater with all the function , then this be the one you should go for .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have be use a Panasonic sc-ht740 5 dvd home Theater System for about nine month and I have be very satisfied . I enjoy my home unit enough to recently purchase a second sc-ht740 for work . here be seven benefit and drawback . benefit : 1 -rrb- the sound quality be excellent when play cd , cd-r , dvd , dvd-r and the radio . 2 -rrb- the bass can be adjust to multiple level . 3 -rrb- the tv 's audio signal can be play through the system . 4 -rrb- the theater can be expand to use a second room speaker . on one of my unit , I use the  sh-fx80  it have issue , but it be worth it . on my other system , I use the  sh-fx60  it work very well . 5 -rrb- the unit hold five disc . 6 -rrb- the system will accept a ipod . 7 -rrb- the unit be physically attractive . drawback : 1 -rrb- the remote control have so many feature that it be difficult to learn and use . 2 -rrb- there be no way to access different video angle . my old dvd remote have a button to select different angle for compatible disc . 3 -rrb- other than the bass level , there be no equalizer to micro-manage the audio signal . 4 -rrb- the remote do not work with my Sony television . 5 -rrb- the sh-fx60 -lrb- wireless rear speaker kit -rrb- and sh-fx80 -lrb- second room speaker -rrb- can not be use on the same unit simultaneously . 6 -rrb- the system be not compatible with pal or sacd disc . 7 -rrb- I often get wavy line on the screen for about five minute . customer service tell I to change the yellow video cable . I have use three different cable -lrb- one of which be gold plate -rrb- and the problem persist . instead of the cable , it may have something to do with the main unit .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	need a space-saving system with big sound ? buy this now !! Panasonic have do really well with this baby . the sound be excellent with both music and movie . and the system be pack with feature such as hdcd , highmat and jpeg decoder . unusually , mp3 disc sound great here , and my track be 160kbp !! oh , the tuner sound really good too . the system sound excellent even at low volume . so there be some merit to the not-too-tasteless bi-amp logo in the front . it be very nearly perfect but ... I briefly test dvd on the system but be use the supply cable for normal composite video , and the color be a bit muted . but I suspect the crappy cable be the demon here , and anyway when I get my own tv I 'll be use the component video output which should be much better . there be s-video output too . to nitpick further dvd be reset when the system go to standby , but luckily there be a memory function which be dead quick to use . the engineer be obviously on cheap drug when they make this oversight . but there be a 5 disc memory , yes this system be a 5-disc changer !! and lastly the remote , good luck if you have chunky finger heh heh heh ! Tips : the speaker cable length supply be miserly , consider get additional length , and do not worry the sound will not deteriorate . I have have to extend they by 4 metre with a different type and I buy cheapo , which mean a extra 16 metre for myself as the Panny be bi-wired - which probably account in part for the great sound . a pain but worth it . for music listening by all account play with the Equalizer but leave the Surround off , it be a bit too artificial . leave the equalizer on , even if leave on the flat Manual mode , the sound open up a bit . the Audio only mode make no audible difference , so leave it off and save you chunky finger ! the blue backlighting look nice but there be a dimmer if it get distractive . yes those engineer think of everything but leave a half-assed resume . for movie , by all account play with the Surround ! all in all this be a great system . and in the States it be a no-brain bargain . and do I mention the speaker look great !! take the grill off !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	order on amazon.com , for way less than anywhere else i could find it . same price at local `` best buy '' as the model below , the fc7 .  for I , im not a expert , the sound be great , i have a bose system before this and it sound way better that that .  install easily but 3 minor grumble . 1 . the surround sound cable be not long enough have to go buy some more . 2 . Doesnt come with Wall mount for the surround sound , why ?! seem like most people have surround speaker in the ceiling or on the wall . 3 . cant connect my Dish Receiver video out through the same video out as the dvd , so i have to switch both the tv and the receiver . no idea why , just wil live with it .  anyway i like sony product be now look for a plasma screen to go with it ! happy listening
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	overall I be and still be very impressed with the sound and build quality of the system . however the main negative point that irritate I be the fact the the system have hardly any connectivity , especially that there be no digital input , which as the AUXILLARLY curcuit ` only ' support Dolby Pro-Logic , unable I to watch sky movie and use my XBOX etc in Dolby 5.1 as intend , and as I have pay over # 350 for the device be disappointing .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be a very nice home theater , excelent sound , very easy to install and worth any dollar you pay for it . I like very much it speaker , small in size e big in sound . very nice complement to my PS3 .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I have be very happy with this setup -lrb- for the money -rrb- with the exception of a out of sync issue when change from one digital channel to another on by cable stb . I have to change the channel on my box to one of the channel in the analog spectrum -lrb- 1-78 -rrb- then switch back to the `` digital '' channel to sync the audio and video back up . annoying and frustrating . this be not the fault of my stb because I do not have the problem unless the receiver be in the mix .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	like the feature , but after set it up find the GUI be totally unusable . the remote send command , -lrb- I could see the red light on the reciever blink ... -rrb- but it would not respond ... it act like it be run Windows for the OS and be try to load outlook or something . LG customer service be useless . what a waste of time !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	could not have ask for a easier transaction and delivery for a great home theater system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	Easy set up and connect to wifi easily . however , disc player result in tv screen go blank in the middle of dvd 's for a second or so in the middle of program , in some case multiple time . menu for multus episode dvd often do not play . Software would not update through wifus which Samsung customer support -lrb- call several time -rrb- attribute to higher than usual call volume -lrb- for a week -rrb- , server problem -lrb- for a week -rrb- , and in one case the guy blame my tv -lrb- ironically also a Samsung -rrb- . customer support be not very helpful . sound quality be mediocre and wireless rear speaker almost useless . however , the blank screen experience and inability to get this fix make the unit useless and I return it since it be defective . my guess be that Samsung have not develop the software and that they home theater unit should be avoid .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	just unboxed this - so far love this system . contrary to other review , you can replace the speaker quite easily , the speakerwire into the unit be a proprietary clip , but the speakerwire into the speaker be just bare wire with a basic clip so you can just use that end to connect to you exist speaker . the only glitch we have run into be streaming Hulu - for some reason this unit will not let we downgrade to standard defn streaming and as a result , Hulu do not stream well . -lrb- we use a PS3 for Hulu and it work great in the same location on standard definition -rrb-
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I purchase this when it be on sale during black Friday week and just recently set it up as it be a Christmas present . . why bother say that , well , I probably should have research a little more before make the purchase , but it be a really slick deal and well , I just go for it . that be say , the number one reason I decide on this particular system be the Wi-Fi `` build in '' option as list in the product description . dongles\/adapters suck . they always have . I do not want one so I buy the one system on sale at that time that say `` build in Wi-Fi . '' well , build in means that the dongle come in the box rather than have to purchase one separately . I think about send it back immediately on principle , but I probably should have do more homework before buy so I just decide to give it a shot . -lrb- I be sure it say `` built-in '' = adapter somewhere else -- like say in the other review here -rrb- first night : set everything up , let software upgrade , wireless work , netflix work . sound great , I mean it , it really sound good for the sale price . . Ok , I think , not so bad , at least I do not need to run more ethernet wire ... Day two : turn it on , go to try pandora -lrb- which be great on this by the way -rrb- I get a error that it could not connect due to `` Network interference '' . . ok check network setting , only `` wire '' be a option . Unplugged and plug in the dongle . . it give I `` wireless '' as a option again but do not recognize any wireless network . . long story short , the dongle fry itself or be just on the edge of self-destruction when it be throw in the box . . I spend WAY TOO MUCH TIME try to get it to work . I would not have spend this kind of time if it be not for the fact that it actually work at first . anyhow , first call to Samsung . not so great . nice enough tech but she final recommendation be to buy another dongle . I stay polite and non-confrontational and just ask if she be sure that this would not be cover by warranty . she say yes . well , ok , I think she be wrong and thank she for she time . I decide to just wire the thing to my laptop and try updates\/see if there be newer firmware\/etc . . also it allow I to try chat support . both time , they be very quick to respond and nice enough . no earth shatter troubleshooting but they do explain how to reset the unit to factory default -lrb- hold down the stop button for 5 seconds while there be no dvd in it . . -rrb- cool . I do that , try the dongle some more . . etc. . no luck so they give I the number to call for tier ii tech support -- -rrb- this number be just the regular customer service number and there be no option for tier 2 in the menu . . ok . . I get another tech and ask for Tier 2 . . she -lrb- Kasey -rrb- say she could try some stuff and ok I go for it . SHE WAS great . I mean it , truly a breath of fresh air in the oft malodorous world of `` support '' . I be perfectly ok with the the win some lose some sort of attitude one must have when call tech support\/customer service for anything . every company have some really good people answer they phone -- -rrb- it be just rare to get someone so good on call 2 . . anyhow , she listen to what I have try , suggest a few thing to rule out error elsewhere , and then just send out a new dongle for I to try . Perfect . . no unnecessary nonsense , and it be good to know that the first tier people you get at samsung be empower enough to actually issue replacement part without have to talk you way up the chain -- you just need a bit of luck for who answer when call in I guess . in the interim , I just run more cable and I have the unit run that way . it work great this way so I doubt i 'll even use the dongle except to maybve see if it just incinerate itself as the previous one must have do . short Version for the rest of the review : feature : five Stars - Netflix , Vudu , Pandora , you Tube , all work great and great quality ! nice . wi-fus : one star - not as advertised - not `` build in '' sound '' four star - very admirable for the price error message : one star - they really be terrible -- there be more I encounter , but say `` Network interference '' as a error message when the unit do not even recognize that the dongle be plug in be just absurd . . they should just say `` error '' for everything as that would be about as useful as the error message that they actually give and at least will not mislead you . coolness stuff : the WLAN adapter port on the back be just a usb port . . this be cool because you can throw a memory stick\/poratble harddrive back there full of pic and a video or whatever and just leave it there out of site . . there be a usb port on the front as well which be design in a way to prevent you from pug in the WLAN dongle in the front . . however , plug a hub into it would allow you to use the front though i do not know why you would want to other than for troubleshooting -lrb- I be test to make sure that it be the dongle and not just the usb port on the back -rrb- more coolness : I have plug three different brand of usb memory stick and 2 different portable hard drive into it and it recognize all of they and allow quick access to music\/pictures\/video etc. . . -lrb- also a network hard drive -rrb- I can not comment on what format it accept , but it seem to have good coverage . . -lrb- though it do not recognize a . wav file -rrb- one big plus , my video folder on my portable hardrive crash window explorer on my xp laptop and on a xp desktop but it do not crash this unit . . nice ! overall , I be very happy with the system now that I have the internet wire . I can not give it more than three star though because it be not really as advertised and the dongle fry itself . if they actually have the wireless build in and it work , it would be five star for sure ... please , please , please Samsung , stop use adapters\/dongles\/whatever ... I know it be a money make thing , but it very nearly result in a return and still would be it not for the other good feature of this product . anyhow , as long as you know that you be not actually get build in Wi-Fi , you should be very happy with this system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	its hard to write a single line for this product its a piece of junk , i buy this a year and half ago . Dont now wher to contact i try all over again and again no reply finally get to trash i sujjest please dont buy this filty product and make ur mode ... nothing be good about this product ... accept speaker good luck ...
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	the system work well for the first two week or so ; after the return deadline expire , it start skip while play my ipod . that problem have grow and include the FM radio , too . I wish it malfunction earlier ... kind of upset that the return be not go to get much of my money back .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	this review may be premature as I have be use this product only for a week . however , some thing immediately stand out : 1 . it do NOT produce surround sound and it be not mean to . so do not be fool by the `` Air surround extreme '' kinda jargon . you will clearly hear sound come out of the speaker bar and that be about it . do not expect sound to bounce off the wall and come at you from the side or from behind you . I be use a optical cable to connect the tv to the receiver . not sure hdmus would make any difference . 2 . the receiver be simple and the build in subwoofer have solid bass performance . I have to bring the bass volumne down to 1 to keep it manageable . this be where you will feel it when watch a movie . it do a excellent job of amplify low frequency without distortion . 3 . unit work with tha harmony 700 remote . 4 . you will have to run setup and crank up the center speaker volume to be able to hear human voice , else they get subdue by the music . out of the box , I could hardly hear actor speak . change to the center column to a 5 or 6 -lrb- max -rrb- do the trick . I be impressed by the sub , but let down by the bar speaker - they sound exactly like desktop speaker . it be a $ 300 system and sound like one . if you be on a budget , I would recommend it . if not , keep look .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	buy this system , on recommendation , in June 2003 . System develop a `` pop '' sound and would shut itself down . by the beginning of August 2003 , I finally get the replacement system and the same problem occur two month later - October 2003 . since Novemeber 2003 , I have be contact Onkyo , by email & faxing , to have this system replace , and they have not respond to I . to I , a bad system and bad customer service mean a bad company . it be now April 2004 and I still have this break down system sit in the corner of my bedroom !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I live in a loft so I can not be run wire all over the place . this deliver great sound , the subwoofer give fine in depth detail without overpower the other speaker . there be many option available to tweak the sound as well as add other speaker if you want to make it a 5.1 system .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	the good : it cost I $ 70 for a dvd\/receiver combo with six speaker . I never have any of the hum subwoofer , crackle , scroll video or any other obvious audio or video fault report on here . I have not have any serious trouble with the remote the bad : it do not play DTS . Dolby pro Logic II -lrb- from Gamecube and ps2 on av input -rrb- can be very iffy . sound seem to jump in and out of the rear speaker a lot . play with menu option usually result in a inexplicable loss of sound from some or all speaker . or sometimes it sound different when you set a option , then it sound even differenter when you try and set the option back to normal ! most setting be not remember if the unit be switch off and on again . if you rear speaker be too close to you -lrb- like i have in my apartment -rrb- , you must lower they individual volume every time the player be switch on . the remote be nice look , but spell all its word out -lrb- like `` play '' intead of -rrb- and `` stop '' instead of -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- you can not skip crappy dvd menu intro and other certain thing like you can on many other dvd player . conclusion : good price , but only get it if you really really can not afford a better dvd\/receiver combo , or better yet , separate component . note : to set the region on the player , go to setup with no disc insert , press right to get to pref page . then press 1,3,7,9 on the remote 's keypad . of course it do not save this , so you 'll need to change it every time you want to play a import dvd .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	nice home theater system . at a reasonable price , you get a complete home theater system with blu-ray player along with access to Netflix , Youtube , Pandora etc. . so far , I be loving it . Easy to setup . the sound quality be great even at loud volume . the bass be good too - shake my floor ! Netflix , Pandora , Youtube work well . easily connect to a external hard drive\/flash drive - can enjoy watch video , music , and photo through the portable media . the iPod doc work great too . I would say , for listen to music and watch movie in a apartment , this be a great find . the only feature miss be independent control over the bass . there be a sound effect call `` bass blast '' which can be select , but other than that no control over the range of frequencies\/volume of the bass individually .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	use they with my Sony cube speaker and they be PERFECT . I would not put anything larger on they .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	i get this system online at Walmart for $ 299 on sale this system be awesome sound great in a small room or medium room i would buy it again if i have to so far 4 day no light problem i guest vizio fix it good sound good base and good power i have a big yamaha system in my living room that be very powerful but this vizio be a great system and true 5.1 sound if you do not want to set up the rear speaker no problem but i like true surround sound i test it out by watch blade and matrix awesome you can hear every detail nice base dose not shake wall but sound very good you know you have base i do not work for amazon or walmart just want to tell people my experience with this system truth of the matter well worth $ 299 if you can get it you will not be disapoint
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	overall I be very pleased with the Panasonic sc-ht640w 5 dvd home Theater System . it sound great and be a great value for its price . it be extremely convenient not to have wire to the rear speaker . I do wish the rear volume be a bit louder , but again a minor problem for I . for those who have a wireless router -lrb- computer signal -rrb- you will likely get interference from the Panasonic Home Theater System . I do not have the spec on the home theater system , but it must also run on wireless Channel 6 , which be the same default signal for my wireless router . if this be you problem -lrb- drop wireless signal on computer -rrb- , you will need to reconfigure you wireless router to another channel . usually a wireless router have channel 1-11 . I set mine to channel 1 and now both system work fine .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	good system with a great sound quality . the cd\/dvd be flexible with regard to us\/european dvd format . altogether lot of feature , but along with that lot and lot of wire . Speaker wire be not long enough for a reasonably size room . to be able to properly use the system , read the manual . even obvious functionality be not necessarily easy to figure out without it . anyone figure out why you need 2 remote control for this combination ? consolidation would be nice , since other electronic gadget each have they own .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	this be a excellent entry-level system -- and you can not beat the price for the performance . if you want a solid 5.1 surround sound system for less than $ 200 , you will not find a better one than the Sony ht-ddw660 . my friend with a Onkyo super-system be amaze at the clarity and depth I get out of this simple Sony -- he say it be every bit as good as he $ 1,000 + system , albeit with fewer bell and whistle . I install this with my Panasonic HD tv and Hughes DirectTV\/TiVo HD receiver use a optical cable -lrb- which you must buy separately -rrb- , and the Sony system automatically switch to the optimal sound configuration on the fly . excellent for the rest of my family who do not want to fiddle with the remote . the digital coax connection make hook up a dvd a breeze , too . I recommend that you also buy the optional speaker stand -lrb- Sony ws-fv11 -rrb- which will cost you another $ 200 for two pair -- odd that four speaker stand cost as much as the actual system -- but they be worth it . my only -lrb- all minor -rrb- complaint be : - the power be a bit low -- you really have to crank it up to get some strong volume . if you have a big room for you home theater , get a bigger sound system than this . - beware switching to FM radio before turn the sound down ; for some reason , the volume level on the radio receiver be MUCH higher than for the tv\/surround sound , so you get blast if you just switch over withor readjust the volume -- weird . - wire into the subwoofer be permanent , unlike the connection for the other five speaker . not a big deal , but you 'll have to cut and splice if you want to use you own speaker cable . - optical cable should have be include . they give you a digital coax , but why not the optical cord ? - pay special attention to the part number on the back of the five speaker -- they determine the proper left\/right\/front \/ back placement -- I miss this when I first set up the system - I be have some trouble configure my Hughes TiVo remote to control the ht-ddw660 -- the recommend TiVo code do not work . Time to get a $ 200 universal remote , I guess ... as I say , all of these be minor complaint -- in general , I be extremely pleased with the sound quality . I keep have to remind myself that I spend less than $ 200 for this great system . highly recommend .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I buy the Visio 55 '' tv so instead of torture myself into overthink what be the best complimentary sound system I buy this one . it set up in a snap and I love it because it be wireless -lrb- kind of -rrb- . no wire be need to connect the subwoofer and sound bar . there be wire from the satellite to the subwoofer and from the Sound Bar to the tv but no big deal . the sound be great . I can hear dialogue without have to get subtitle . it be simple and efficient for someone who want good sound but do not want to spend more than 1\/2 the price of the tv on speaker .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	First of all , I would like to say I be not a audiophile . I use to install home theater as well as cable , so I be slightly more advanced than clueless when it come to a\/v . live in Florida , not many home be make to optimize a surround sound system . my home be very open , my living room have peak ceiling , and my entire house have a wood ceiling . I do not want to mess with the wood ceiling and put rear speaker in my home would not be feasible . but , the my stock tv speaker -lrb- along with all stock tv speaker -rrb- be terrible . I want to amp up my sound . know I be not go to have surround sound , and not want to throw down nearly $ 1,000 for a bose 3.2.1 system , I begin look at sound bar . I frequent best buy , HH Gregg , Sears , etc. check out the sound bar . many have wireless sub which I do like . other be setup so all the wire be go through the sound bar itself . again , I do not like that idea . I see this sound bar on the Daily Deal for $ 249.99 . after diving into review , there be two main complaint . First be the system do not produce true surround sound . to I , this should not be in any review . it be a sound bar . of course it do not produce true surround sound . the second complaint have something to do with run a 3d signal through the receiver which require a update that be hard to load . this do not pertain to I because my television nor any of my component be or ever will be 3d . so , I be sell on the review . I like the idea that this unit work have a receiver . all my component would run through the receiver just like any other receiver . I be skeptical about have the sub build into the receiver . I be not a huge fan of component be build into component -lrb- all-in-one htib - when one thing go , you lose everything -rrb- . I will update this review if I have any issue with it . I order the item on Monday with the normal free shipping . it arrive on Wednesday - that be gnarly . set up the system be very easy . it sound great . it 100 % do the job intend of better my tv speaker . movie , television , and video game be much more enjoyable . the music sound amazing . the remote look cheaply make , but it be a remote . the remote have a very simple design which be convenient for the technologically impaired . I be very pleased with this purchase . it sound great . I be stress the fact that I be not a audiophile and that this unit be only intend to compensate for my tv speaker . it go above and beyond what be expect . I hope this help !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I assemble it last night and figure where I want to put the speaker and what to do about the wiring etc. . it be early on but the assembly be simple and I be love the wireless rear speaker . the major part of my house be surround in rich music \/ movie \/ etc. . the coverage be absolutely amazing . as I say , it be early on but I be loving it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	many reviewer note the problem with the led go out but do not go into too much depth about the importance of the led , which make the decision to buy this product somewhat of a risk for I . therefore , I would like to focus my review on that aspect of the product . I have have my 510 for about 2 week now and have mostly love it . the led work flawlessly for I -lrb- so far -rrb- , but what be they really for ? what be the big deal with whether or not the light work ? okay ... there be 2 area of the light ; one area -lrb- on top -rrb- that tell you what `` audio mode '' you be in , and a second area that tell you volume and balance -lrb- whether bass be high\/low , whether the center channel be louder relative to the rear , etc -rrb- . the light on top tell you what signal you have . if you receive a dolby signal , the light on the leave -- directly underneath the DTS\/Dolby logo -- will come on and it will be blue . in the user manual , this light be refer to as be `` position 1 '' . if you receive a dt signal , the light under the DTS\/Dolby logo will be orange . if you do not receive a Dolby or DTS signal , that light just will not be on . I would imagine that if you do not have that light on , it would be annoying because you would not know -lrb- unless you have get the ear of a bat -rrb- for sure whether you be get a true hd signal . however , I do not have animalistic ear so I pretty much rely on that light to tell I whether I have get hd audio . the great thing about this setup though be that even without the Dolby\/DTS , the sound be fantastic . that be where sr come in , which basically simulate surround sound . you have 3 different version of SRS , each of which have very specific function . first there be sr truvolume , which be suppose to maintain consistent volume level when , for instance , change channel . you know how the volume for a tv show will be comfortable , but then the volume in the commercial blast you off the couch ? SRS TruVolume be suppose to prevent that . -lrb- for the record , I do not watch much tv and when I do I just use the tv speaker at a low level anyway , so I can not write on the efficiency of the TruVolume feature -rrb- . you 'll know if you have truvolume on when the Blue light come on right below the SRS logo -lrb- which Vizio refer to as `` position 3 '' -rrb- . next there be the SRS TruSurround feature , which will simulate a hd surround sound even if there be not a true hd audio source . here be what I love about this system , and why I probably would not care if the light fail . even though I do not have the most sensitive ear , I can tell a significant improvement in surround sound quality when the SRS TruSurround be turn on . you hit the SRS tshd button on you slide-out remote and you have get instant hd audio . if you light be work however , you 'll know you have this feature when the light in position 2 -lrb- in between the Dolby and SRS logo -rrb- turn blue . finally with sr , you have SRS WOW HD which be mainly for listen to music . currently I be listen to a fairly rock KT Tunstall track through these speaker and it sound like she be put on a show right in my house -- it be truly that clear . do a blind test -lrb- ie : if the light be not on -rrb- you can still figure out which setting -lrb- off , TruSurround , or WOW HD -rrb- be turn on . when off , the music sound flat . when Tru Surround be on , the music pretty much only come out of the front channel speaker and the instrument get drown out by the vocal . with WOW HD , it sound like a live concert setup ; it just sound natural be the best way I can describe it -- it be perfectly balance . the next set of light come from behind the soundbar foam -lrb- or whatever the technical term for the fabric that cover speaker be call -rrb- . if all volume and balance setting be factory default , you 'll have something that look like this : '' o -rrb- '' . if you turn up the volume , it 'll look like : '' o '' and so on and so forth . you can also adjust the bass , treble , sub , center , and rear channel . if you want more sound from the center channel , hit the right button and you 'll end up with something that look like : '' o '' . or if you want less from the center , '' o '' . when it be even , it 'll look like '' -lrb- o -rrb- '' . these light be probably more important than the orange and blue led because the change be much more subtle -- except for the volume level , which be quite noticeable . have these light work will let you know exactly where the level be . however , even with the light let I know where the level be , I still rely more on my own hearing to figure out where I want the sound to be . when I hit the up\/down button enough to where it sound good to I , I stop . the light indicator be nice and I hope mine do not quit , but it will not upset I too much if they fail . all in all , I be very impressed with the quality of these speaker . whether I be watch a blu-ray disc , a movie on Netflix or Amazon VOD , and whether I have a true-hd -lrb- Dolby or DTS -rrb- source , I feel like I be in the middle of the shot . everything sound crystal clear , from all speaker channel . the only negative about this setup be the lack of additional input . otherwise , it be nearly perfect .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this system continue to blow I away . it have all the power you could want , great sound satellite and a serious subwoofer . the reciever be a great quality piece . I have absolutely to quibble about with this system ; I think it sound as good if not better than system that be double the price . movie be amazing , and music sound great in the Direct , unprocessed mode .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I just buy this system after two year of major search . unfortunately , I should have wait another two year .  pro  can play almost any type of audio\/video disk Easy setup the main player look impressive  con  can not perform the most basic operation of my older , lesser Sony model ; include : can not change one disk while play another , and no shuffle mode ! -lrb- note to self ... never throw a party -rrb-  the sound be shallow , tinny , and weak . the listener be remind of a alarm clock radio . when in `` surround sound mode '' the listener be remind of several alarm clock radio .  the speaker be , in my opinion , very outlandish look . you 'll have difficulty incorporate they into any decor ; unless of course you live in a laboratory or industrial facility .  bottom-line  I would hold out on home theater for now . wait another two year for the high-end -lrb- $ 600 - $ 1000 -rrb- model to come down in price . also , power satellite speaker will be available within two year for a good price . that mean no more wire in you living room , so even the most unnatractive speaker can stay relatively hide .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	own a Samsung tv , we want a similar brand for the audio in order to take advantage of the smart link feature . although the player have very nice feature , the sound be disappointing for a HT System . the subwoofer be passive - not have a build in amplifier - and look and sound cheap . there be just few limited environment you can choose from the DSP option , but these be not able to sharpen the sound at a decent quality . you can definitively have a nicer sound from a pc surround system . the system have auto calibration feature , but the measurement get consistently wrong . if you have a room with hard surface -lrb- no carpet , bare wall -rrb- the processor get confuse by the reflection .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I have my unit for 1 month before experience the `` f61 '' many people have see . I call they repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 month and it seem that none of the part that Panasonic send they could fix the unit . to this date , I still can not get Panasonic to send I a refurbish unit . on top of that , I have to drive the unit 97 mile to the nearest repair shop . I would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it come to service the warranty .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	price and performance be what I want and get . I need something to replace my old break down speaker system . the crummy speaker on my tv would not cut it . setup be simple ; it be practically plug and play . I get what I expect . nothing fancy or blow you out of the room but good enough to get the job do . the room it be in be a fairly large odd shaped room but that do not seem to affect the performance at all . I would recommend this to anyone on a budget that just need to get actual sound from whatever you be watch or play .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I buy this system as a Christmas gift for my husband . I be embarrassed to even say I spend one cent on this so call dvd home Theatre System . can you return it ? I do not even see where you can return this item . we will be watch the a dvd and the volume will just go mute . it be very aggravating . if you turn the volume up past one you get blast ! I would not recommend this system .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this system rock ! I be the type a person who spend $ 299.00 on earphone to have the sound from from my stereo -lrb- htib -rrb- match what come out of my mp3 player , and because when it come to earphone , I believe you usually get what you pay for . in short , I be a audiophile . those who be complain about some hissing noise from the system likely do not have the speaker hook up correctly . the speaker must be connect exactly as outline or you will have sound problem . hook the speaker to my Yamaha system be not nearly as exact . my yamaha system sound wonderful , and I never think that a system make by LG could rival it when it come to sound . the LG sound better . I buy the LG because my hdtv be a LG , but the system be surpass my expectation both for tv and movie watching and for all other audio type .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I just get this system a month or two ago , and I be happy with it . the speaker be quite outstanding actually . I have everything run through a Sony receiver -lrb- the one that I have already review -rrb- along with some vintage Yamaha center speaker , and the setup sound quite nice so far . as everyone have already mention regard klh sound system , the speaker be amazing , and the subwoofer lack bass . then again , you do save a great deal of money on the sattellite system , so throw it towards a decent sub . the speaker come with everything require for mount , except decent wall screw . also , the include speaker wire be absolutely dreadful , I would recommend get you own separately .  this system be perfect for a apartment where you have to worry about neighbor above and below complain about constant wall thumping . I have have no complaint thus far . I do not mean to sell the sub short , it be nice for the price , and do not seem like its go to blowout any time soon . again , if you want to shake the painting off you neighbor wall , you might want to try something else .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be look at the bose 3-2-1 when I come upon this system . for the difference in price , I think `` what the heck '' . I be so glad I make this choice . the sound quality be outstanding and the look be amazing . we have a small condo and this be sufficient to listen to music throughout the entire place .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	love this thing sound quality be clear the base be strong I think it be go to be weak but I be wrong .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I be amaze how powerful this sound once it be hook up . the system be not top of the line by any means but for the price ... WOW ! I have have no issue with the product and my only compaint be that the power switch be a hard switch , mean that you cant use the remote to turn it on and off , only to mute it . other than this , product be excellent ! EDIT : two week later one of the imput have die completly . I now only have the front input and one in the back . this be very disapointing and I be afraid that the second one on the back could die soon . I do not crank it all the way to max volume or anything so I should not be have these kind of issue in 2 week . I be consider ship it back but that will end up cost I more than it be worth I would imagine . beware .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I could not use it to the fullest potential as I live in a apartment . I like it till now , I have flat screen tv never face any problem as they describe in other review for plasma tv 's . I like the look of it too , the tall boy speaker look great . I pay 410 $ and I be expect 50 $ back -lrb- 360 $ -rrb- . I feel it be worth the money . I rate it 5 star from experience .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this surround sound have great sound and be very easy to install , and consider the price versus one of the more expensive one with dvd or bluray player ... you be really better off with this one ! for starter most people already have one of these player or console in they home so to go through the expense of pay 300 to 500 and sometimes more be ridiculous ! for one you can just run the audio cord to you tv to get all extra sound for anything you have hook for it ... it be not necessary to buy the adapter for the hdmus cord ! why buy the adapter when you can , like I say , just run the cord to you tv . I love the sound it generate and it be a space saver ! I have a older model that be just too bulky and take up too much of what space I do have for it . . which trust I be very little . the only thing I would say I have prob with be the fact that the remote be so small and easy to loose !
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	even thouth it say it be a receiver . it be not . you can not hook up you cable tv to it and use the speaker . you can only use the speaker if you play a dvd or listen to the tuner . it be not a true theater in a box as it say . I will be send it back .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I get this system about eight month ago and I have be very pleased with it . I do have a few complaint about it , however . my first complaint be the horrible remote , which never become intuitive no matter how much you use it . the chapter skip button and the fast forward button be one in the same . to fast forward you have to hold the chapter skip button for a few seconds . if you do not hold it long enough , you end up skip a chapter when you simply want to fast forward . the fast forwarding , however , be very good , allow up to 32x normal play speed . another complaint I have be the optical input . I have read that the sound lag behind the video , and I be dismayed to discover it be true . it can be very severe , like a couple of seconds . then I discover a way to correct it . all you have to do be pause and unpause the input source , and they will be synch . I test this by connect my ps2 and use it as a dvd player . the Samsung lose synch when start a movie or skip chapter , but after one pause and unpause of the ps2 , remain perfectly synchronize . another complaint I have be that the rear channel sound during Dolby ProLogic II surround playback be too low in volume . you can edit the sound , though , to increase the volume to the rear speaker , and the unit remember these value after it be turn off . I also find the Dolby Prologic II mode to be useless for anything but video game -lrb- which be what I use it for - and it be great -rrb- . it make music and tv sound like crap , so do not go out of you way to get Dolby Prologic II support if you do not intend to use it for gaming . even though I have some complaint about this system , I be still glad that I buy it , especially for the price that I pay ; however , a lot have change in the past eight month and many other player be offer similar feature in this price range . this player be good , but it be not so good that you would not want to seriously investigate other buy option .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	after about two year the player destroy a new dvd . the changer mess up and will not eject the other disk in the player . after it be take apart and the other disk remove my dad find that a small mod will make it a single disk player but still usable . still have great sound but only a single disk player .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy these speaker for my boyfriend 's birthday after much research . after read all the review I decide on these & I be glad I do : -rrb- very easy to set up , and the sound that come out of these speaker be very good . not incredible but much better than we tv speaker . we be get to the point of have to turn the tv all the way up just to hear the dialogue on some movie . well no more ! music sound really good too , can not wait for football season to see what these baby can do !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	Este teatro en casa proporciona muy buenas caracteristicas de sonido . Muy buen bajo . La configuracion e muy simple . El recibidor e un poco grande para mi gusto . Las entrada hdmus reproduccion el sonido con una calidad muy al incluso el sonido 3d . Para mi gusto e una de las mejores compras . .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I buy mine at Costco a few week ago for $ 300 and now it be on here for $ 270 ! buy one now . this be a great unit for the money . Easy setup , the speaker be not too large and it be nicely design with a lot of option . I be not go to go into all the detail because other reviewer have already cover they . I actually work in sound and I be really please with this unit . Sony be always quality stuff . there be more than enough power here for you . and I love that i can plug in my Iphone and play my itune - man , it sound terrific .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be very picky with my recommendation , but this system be one you can not beat for the price . I love the fact that you can get this without a dvd player , for those who already have one seperately . you 'll hear movie and music in a way you never have before . get ready to be blow away .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	this be a great system . sound from the speaker be incredible . have a Yamaha System before I pick this one up and it totally blow the Yamaha away . recently watch swordfish and some scene actually make my wall shake and the volume be not even at half . setup be simple ... do yourself a favor and get this system , you will not be sorry .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I really have high hope for this system . it have good review . the price be right . what could go wrong ? sadly , sound quality can go wrong apparently . I think it be quite possible that I receive a defective unit as the center channel do not produce any audio most of the time and when it do , it make voice sound completely muffle . on the upside , the sub in the unit sound great . it put out some rumble bass and I have to keep it turn down to `` 0 '' or '' +1 '' so as not to totally annoy the neighbor -lrb- love that apartment life -rrb- . I do not experience any of the setup issue that other people mention ; set-up be quick and easy . with all say and do however , I return the unit to Amazon today . pro : Easy set-up hdmus inputs\/output powerful sub con : Center channel sound muffle if it work at all
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I use it in my bedroom and the sound quaility be much better than the tv speaker , the output be not too lound as use in a bedroom , the only draw back be it have no hdmus input , so you can not connect any hdmus device to it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	HOW DO I get the surround sound to work with cable tv and not just the dvd . ALSO THANKS for the ipod hook up . jack
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I have have the KLH ha7000 for just about a year . I be in the middle of watch a dvd when the screen freeze . I have to take the system apart to get the dvd out and now it will not work at all . I turn it on and it say welcome . none of the other function work , so now I be stick with a almost $ 200 piece of junk ! do not buy this product , it be a piece of crap . I wish I have read other review before buy because the general consensus be , Crap .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I get it this thanks give . I be keen on get one and be wait for a decent deal . finally get it for $ 199 . a great price for this system . it take I less than a hour to set it all up . sound clarity be great ! I use it my living room -lrb- 15x25 foot -rrb- and it sound really nice . the only negative be that speakers\/woofer connect thro the dvd player which mean you can not use it while play tv\/cable\/vcr . but that could be easily fix - I have to get a audio-video cable -lrb- for 3 buck -rrb- to give my tv output to the dvd player and it work just fine . overall , a excellent home theater system !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I have be spoil all my life with my parent THX home theater system and digital projector , and when I move out , although I didd not have enough money to afford $ 10,000 worth of equipment I still want a home theater setup . this apex unit catch my eye because of its feature set and low price - I be not expect much . suprisingly enough , this little puppy really perform ! that not to say that its a substitute for a full on home theater setup , but if you be on a tight budget and still want to watch you movie in 5.1 this be the way to go .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEU	3	I buy this system for my bedroom and it be unique from all the other `` home theater in a box '' system that I could find in that it have a component video input . I need this because my cable box support hdtv through component cable . the Samsung provide this feature with its `` digital in '' input selection and nicely pass through the component video throught its own component video output . I do not need or want the dvd changer but the lesser Samsung model leave out the component video input . I find use the changer a little bit of a hassle to insert and remove single dvd and it seem slower than use a single tray . the speaker be nice and small and that be what I be look for . the microphone to auto-balance the sound be a really nice feature and work well -lrb- it be all automatic -rrb- . I do not have any real opinion about the sound quality of the unit and speaker -- it seem fine to I but I be not good at evaluate sound quality beyond verify the 5.1 sound . the wireless rear speaker be a interesting gadget and do remove one set of wire from the unit to the rear . this really do not matter much to I -lrb- my unit be place against a side wall so run the wire across the floor be not horrible -rrb- . I do notice that there be some periodic interruption of the rear sound even within the small size of my bedroom . I rotate the receiver and it seem to make it go away during the sound test . I ultimately return this unit because it be incompatible with dvd-rw that I record from my Tivo in a different room . I be pretty surprise that such a new unit would have this incompatibility -lrb- I have see some older computer laptop have the same problem -rrb- . because of this , I have to attach a separate dvd player and this defeat the advantage of the small , all-in-one unit . I also could not take advantage of the component output of the dvd since there be only one component video input on the unit . since it do not upconvert composite video i also have to change the tv input when I switch between cable hdtv and play my dvd-rw . so for I it be just a lot of trouble . I give up on the idea of a combined unit and get a separate a\/v receiver with a separate 5.1 speaker set . more cable , more component to stack .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I expect this rca rt151 home Theatre System to crush my Durabrand HT-3917 Home theater system . and I be very disappointed . the RCA have 80-watt of power ! the Durabrand have only 40-watt . my durabrand be twice as loud ! ! ! and cost half as much ! ! ! rca be not the way to go . buy DURABRAND .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	the title say it all ! this system be the perfect choice for a great movie experience while lay in bed . the quality of sound be superb and quite honestly I would have not expect the quality from a standard set up from Sony . this system could quite possibly be the basis for a `` e '' setup . my only gripe , which be the reason I give it 4 star vs. 5 , be that disc eject and disc swap take a unusually long amount of time . my old 5 disc carousel swap disc out quicker than this model . great package though ! do yourself a favor and skip the davc500 model and get this one !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	4	I like how this soundbar look and be a very clean package . I have not have any led light issue and it work fine with my 64 inch samsung plasma , , , sound be very good , , bass and sub be respectable , , i love the no mess wireless sub and rear speaker , , , over all a great buy for the $ 250 i spend on it .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	2	I be very disappointed with this system , my integrate tv speaker sound better than this system , needless to say I have return it . after read review and see the `` savings '' I think it would be a good buy . the biggest problem be the sound bar do not produce quality sound . it be a small cheap feeling bar , and it sound , well , small and cheap . the bar have no middle , and the result be no matter what the setting , I have difficulty understand dialog during movie . imagine hook up a subwoofer to you cell phone speaker . the integrate receiver and subwoofer seem like a good idea when I purchase . however , after set up and some use some problem with this setup become obvious to I . First be you have a component that will now vibrate . this mean it be recommend keep it isolate from device such as tv and dvd\/blueray player . the receiver be bigger than I expect so this become more of a issue than I expect . Second be that unless you have some odd home theater setup , the result of this integration be that you have a line of sight bass reflex port point at you . this make the bass unpleasant . instead of that bass fill the room feeling , it be come right at you from one place . I now understand why most subwoofer face down or towards the wall . I have a open floor plan room so I return think maybe my room be too big for a sound bar . however end up try a VIZIO soundbar with wireless subwoofer . the result be a great surprise . my room be not to big for a soundbar , this one just be not very good .
HomeTheaterSystem	NEG	1	I read the negative review for Koss dvd player online , but I think I would give it a shot anyway , as Sears have a good deal over Christmas . well , the 90 day warranty run out a few week ago , and now the machine be nothing but a big silver paperweight . will not read ANY disk anymore . have not have a single problem till this , but on every review site , people describe similar experience . Ugh . I guess I deserve it .
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	I be completely happy with this purchase . it be simple to hook up ... even for a tech delinquent like I ! I do not realize how sad the speaker in my tv be until I get this . it be great for movie as well as music listening . good buy ... love it !
HomeTheaterSystem	POS	5	after a lot of research I choose this sound bar and be very glad I do . the sound be superb for we `` bedroom theater '' and it make a huge difference to we view experience . it be not in the same league as we living room 's sound system of course -lrb- nearly $ 2k -rrb- , but we do not expect that . one thing that be very important to we be the clarity of speak voice -lrb- i.e. center channel -rrb- . we boomer-generation ear be not what they use to be . this unit have the clearest voice channel we have ever hear on any system . this be a huge plus to we , and it enable we to keep the volume at comfortable level while still hear the voice clearly . the system have plenty of volume -- way more than we would ever need in we bedroom . the subwoofer be more than adequate , especially for a bedroom . most other sound bar system require you to put the receiver\/subwoofer on the floor , which can make it difficult to see the display and operate with a remote . I like have it where I can see it -lrb- the display be dimmable , by the way -rrb- . as other reviewer have note , it do not emulate true surround sound , but it be a nice compromise in my opinion . the look of the system be fantastic . the bar be very sleek , and the subwoofer\/receiver look very cool in we furniture . -lrb- we have a dresser that have two audio compartment along the top shelf , and a 50-inch plasma -rrb- . before buy it , I have to convince my wife that it would make a real difference to we view experience , and she kind of roll she eye . finally she agree to let I buy it as a early birthday present for myself . well , guess what ! she like it even more than I do . she feel that it totally change we bedroom , not only for tv viewing but also music -lrb- cable digital music channel -rrb- . the great music sound actually lead to we watch somewhat less tv and listen to more music . not a bad thing ! if you be look for a high-end system for you living room , this one will not blow you away , and you probably should not be consider a sound bar anyway . but for a bedroom or secondary tv watch area or a modest living room set up , it be a great way to go .
