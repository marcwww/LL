Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I use to be a subscriber and a avid reader . recently , perhaps in the last two year or so , the quality of the writing have become rather poor . the selection of article be uninteresting , and sometimes half the article themselves be so poorly write as to be unreadable . the fiction be simply mediocre , and the entire magazine seem to be infect with editor Lewis Lapham 's shrill and ever-growing notebook -lrb- do the man ever have anything interesting or original to say ? -rrb- . in short , Harper 's be not the magazine it once be . I would suggest the Atlantic monthly if you want a magazine that be interesting , informative , and well-written , cover to cover .

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	Asimov 's science fiction magazine be one of the premier source of new short story and novellum length science fiction . it also have the occasional serialized novel . have be introduce to science fiction through Isaac Asimov 's own short story anthology back in the 70 's I be surprise to find how much I enjoy the return to the short story format after many year of `` blockbuster novel '' . the magazine consistently showcase the best new talent . it also have a stable of veteran , commercially successful , writer that use the magazine as a vehicle to return to they root . notable such as Michael Swanwick , James Patrick Kelly , Kage Baker , and Tom Purdom to name a few . Asimov 's seem to always have nominee in the yearly Nebula and Hugo award for science fiction .  most story be `` Social Science fiction '' in which a loose future backdrop be use to tell a character base story with a eventual universal truism reveal . it be rare to find a `` hard science fiction '' story in which the extrapolation of known science into a future setting play a critical role in the climax and conclusion of the story . Stories from the early writings of Larry Niven be good example of such story . this be a forgivable lapse as most editor would tell you that they would love to see more hard science submission .  the magazine also boast one of the best editorial section pen by acclaimed author Robert Silverberg . he cover topic range from strict science to historical recollection of the science fiction genre . he have also reintroduce many reader to lose story and author such as Cordwainer Smith with great biographical piece .  they also have poem ; no offense Mr. Haldeman .

Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	for I , the September issue of Vogue , with its 700 page issue , be more than eye candy . it be art . it be that simple . I no longer look at most of the fashion in the magazine , nor the model , as realistic , something that can ever transfer into my own life , nor would I want it to . it remind I of trip to art museum where I can admire one painting half the afternoon , but it do not mean I want it hang on my wall at home . Vogue 's photography be exquiste , pure art . the glossy page , the vibrant , sometimes muted color , seem to jump off the page . the image make my mind wander and explore . when I finally get over the ridiculous price and the more ridiculously thin model with leg longer than I be tall , I be able to fully appreciate the artistry of the ad and fashion spread . I find the ad be as engaging as the fashion spread , which be a good thing , for the magazine be at least half ad . some of the article be quite good as well . I scan the few society article , and I have be surprise at the high number of well-written piece that apply to the average world-wise woman . Cosmo reader most likely will not find much in Vogue , but I would say woman over 30 , who be relatively sophisticated , will find article gear toward they . overall , Vogue be a high end publication with excellent , artistic photographer and produce rather sweet eye candy with a good number of current , well-written non-fashion article .

''  the illustration , too vary widely -- from `` church Sunday school '' picture of angel from the Renaissance master , to more ordiinary drawing of sea captain , cop , lumberjack , ordinary mom and dad -- depend on the story they illustrate . -lrb- if you know `` guidepost '' , you know the artwork -- otherwise , think `` Reader 's Digest . '' -rrb-  the purpose of the magazine be not to convert you to anything but , rather , to tell true story about people who have have encounter with guardian angel . `` belief '' be leave up to the reader . some of the angel story be of the `` miracle '' type : survive car crash , shipwreck , serious illness , etc. . other be of the more `` ordinary '' type , such as the stranger who be there at the right moment . this fit with the jewish pov of a angel , since the Hebrew word , malach , can refer either to a supernatural be or a earthly messenger .  personally , I believe in angel , and I find the story fascinating . grant , some of they might strike you as version of `` the vanishing hitchhiker . '' on the other hand , all the story be first-person , by-lined account , often with photo of the people or animal involve . and how do we know the vanishing hitchhiker be not a real angel sometimes ?

I guess the Editors feel there be no point in expand the one good section this brochure do have . I would recommend you save you money and not subscribe to this publication .

I have read many issue and while the writing be pretty good , I have never find a article that I think be worth saving , or even much that tell I something I do not know about Chicago , and I have only live here a few year . do not be fool by the title -- this magazine be fine for what it be , but it do not even come close to cover Chicago .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	j-14 be cheap and not well write . in my opinion , it focus too much on celebrity and not enough on thing teens age 11-15 really care about -lrb- intellectual one at least -rrb- . unless you really want to know what Britney Spears eat for breakfast every Thursday , skip it and go for seventeen or Girls Life .

I once subscribe several year ago and , although it be a look at the picture and toss after skim type of magazine , think enough of the magazine to give it another try , but take my advice and save you money . you 'll just get excuse and aggravation , lose money and receive nothing but a chance to write a review and complain .

I do not save every issue , but I save a lot , as there be so much timeless information and good music to be find . in the few issue withe arm 's reach I see a story on the music of `` O Brother where be Thou ?

Naipul , Joyce Carol Oates , Don Dilillo , et al. , you would be hard press to find a literary rival . fun , user friendly , challenging , and eye opening , Harper 's be just the best thing out there . hold a firm edge over such other as Atlantic monthly , the New Yorker , Mother Jones , and the Economist , Harper 's deliver information and creativity with zeal unmatched in today 's magazine scene .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	its quite simple National Geographic be the magazine . no other publication can deliver the article , the photo , the research proyect , the map and the overal quality . this a magazine for those with the constant `` itch '' to go further and to learn more about the world and the universe .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I be a NatGeo junky . my collection of this magazine span four decade . this publication be magnificent for many of the reason that have already be state . if human be to send a capsule into deep space so that a alien culture might come upon it and learn something about the Earth and it be inhabitant , many have suggest that the capsule contain the entire National Geographic collection - 1888 to the present . in what other publication can you find fascinating article , map , rendering and photo on Pterodons , a frog epidemic , Lewis & Clark , the Hubble space telescope , and balinese culture - and all this in a single issue ?! it truly be the Universal Encyclopedia . answer accusation : the magazine report on `` the world and everything in it '' as honestly and evenly as any publication could hope to do . in the past decade , many of Geographic 's story have focus on imperil species , culture or ecosystem . these be hugely important issue that we should be proud to learn about . I get incense when people accuse the magazine and its editor of be political -lrb- leftist -rrb- . every article -lrb- I have read every issue since 1961 -rrb- which concern the environment explore both side of the issue at hand - the need of people and the impact on the planet . the Magazine have not become more liberal in the past 4 decade , the world itself have become a more impoverished place as the we number have soar past 6 billion . this magazine get my absolute highest recommendation . I wish that everyone out there would subscribe to and collect National Geographic . not only will they become a ornament on you bookshelf or coffee table , but you 'll be wiser and more worldly after immerse yourself in they , as well .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	I would like to classify myself as a moderate but I probably lean conservative . because of that , I subscribe to Harpers so that I could read good writing that would challenge my belief and stretch my mind in new way . I get that , more or less , at first , but over the course of a couple of year the magazine drift further and further to a leftist propaganda screed , the worst of which be Louis Lapham 's bitter drivel editorial . it get to a point where the writing be incredibly predictable ; I know exactly what position -lrb- read : left of pelosus -rrb- the writer -- any writer in Harpers -- would take on whatever the issue be , and I have a pretty good idea of what the line of whine would be . if you attend dinner party on the Upper East Side ; if you drive a Prius to the Oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming be a environmental travesty ; if you have ever desecrate a Starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine be for you . however , if you be dumbfounded at how the Republicans can keep win election -- and then you realize they have the democratic party as opponent ; if you realize the genius of George Bush and Karl Rove be in get liberal to underestimate George Bush and Karl Rove ; if you want to read smart , insightful write that will inform and entertain , then try the Atlantic monthly -lrb- which , by the way , I be surprise to see reviewer describe as a liberal magazine ; I think it be moderate , and if anything , a bit on the conservative side . -rrb- needless to say , I let my Harpers subscription lapse . two star , tho , for the Harper 's Index -- however , that be not worth the price of a subscription -lrb- it get to be the only thing worth anything for the price of the subscription -rrb- .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEU	3	I absolutely hate when a magazine choose to send I multiple issue at the same time to start my subscription . I do not have time to get through 3 issue before the next one come . I be sure it be much more convenient for the publisher but in this day and age , they computer can easily keep track of when my subscription start and end . at this point , I be unlikely to renew this subscription because of this practice .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	regular reader of my review be probably get sick of I mention Kage Baker , but I have to credit she for get I to try a lot of thing that I would not normally try if she have not be a part of they . Asimov 's Science Fiction magazine be another time where this be the case . while I have buy Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine every month for a while now , I would also check Asimov 's to see if it have a Baker story . if it do , I would buy it . what I have find , however , be that I have enjoy most of the other story in the issue I have buy as well . thus , from now on I will be buy it every month too . much like Fantasy & Science Fiction , Asimov 's contain mostly science fiction story of various length -lrb- short story , novelette , novellum -rrb- along with a couple of column and some cartoon . the difference between the two be that Asimov 's contain no fantasy -lrb- though some of Mike Resnick 's story have a fantasy feel to they -rrb- . however , the magazine like to concentrate on character-based science fiction , so you will not see a lot of `` technology first , character second '' story in the magazine . personally , I think that be a good thing as hard science fiction turn I off . if you be more into the hard science , you may find stuff in here to interest you , but there be a good chance that you will not . occasionally , there will be guest editorial -lrb- they print George R.R. Martin 's Guest of honor speech from Worldcon in the October\/November issue -rrb- . there be always a `` on book '' column , sometimes write by Paul Di Filippo , sometimes by Peter Heck . the author use this column to recommend book that you may not have come across . Robert Silverberg open each issue with a `` reflection '' column that can cover everything from space exploration to idea on story-writing . James Patrick Kelly occasionally be feature with a `` on the net '' column , examine various science fiction web site and other online activity . unlike Fantasy & Science fiction , there be often some poetry include as well . finally , there be a calendar of upcome convention that cover the world so you can always find someplace to go if you need to get together with a group of fan . the bread and butter of the magazine , though , be the story . each story have a introduction from the editor -lrb- currently Gardner Dozois , though that will change to Sheila Williams with the January issue -rrb- , which may explain the genesis of the story , or just tell we how long it be be since that author have appear in Asimov 's . one of the thing about Asimov 's that be different be that it often serialize story that will eventually appear in book form .

Steele 's Coyote series have be serialize over the last couple of year with all of they be collect in two book -lrb- coyote from a couple of year ago , and the upcome Coyote rise -rrb- . also , Charles Stross ' Accelerando have be feature in recent issue . the one drawback to this be for reader who only pick up the occasional issue . for instance , `` Survivor '' in the October\/November issue do not really mean a lot because I have miss everything that come before it . it do reward regular reader , though . Asimov 's have many writer who write almost exclusively for that magazine , or at the very least the author submit they story to this magazine for first refusal . my favorite , Kage Baker , only seem to appear here , with only one story that I know of appear in realm of Fantasy . Allen M. Steele be another . Robert Reed seem to be feature everywhere -lrb- I swear that guy be churn they out like he be a machine -rrb- but he be feature a lot in Asimov 's . the magazine be bind just like Fantasy & Science fiction , however the cover be thin paper rather than thicker stock , so it will tear a bit easier . this do have the advantage that you can sometimes leave it lie open for reading -lrb- though this only work if you be toward the middle of it -rrb- . it also mean it can be roll up if necessary . the only other fault I have with it , and this be strictly a personal thing , be that the story do not always grab I as much as they do in Fantasy & Science fiction . this be mainly because I be more into fantasy than science fiction , so this certainly would not be the case for everyone . while the hit and miss ratio vary from issue to issue , I can say that I have never skip a story in the magazine . again , that be a benefit of short fiction . you be not go to waste a lot of time on they . if I have to choose between the two magazine , I would definitely choose Fantasy & Science fiction . however , Asimov 's be certainly good enough that it be easy to make room for both of they . plus , by pick they both up , I feel like I be do my part in keep short fiction alive . it be only a small part , but every little bit help .

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	this magazine be great just for keep the spirit . it be fill with many success story . but hardly any of those success story include the detail that lead they into success . it be also extremely gear towards franchise . every other article , and every other ad be about franchise . I have a one year subscription and at this point I be bore . I 'll keep the subscription , but it be highly unlikely that I will renew next year . \*\*\* Though one should check out they web site at entrepreneur.com . you will find that it be the total opposite of the magazine , and will prove to be a great wealth of information .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	AMAZON ALWAYS have the right price on all the magazine . NATIONAL GEO . WAS a excellent price and I give it as a gift .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	a friend once say to I , `` if you want a glossy that be a no brainer then get Vogue ! '' how right she be , despite have glorious photography , fashion model that dare not stand sideways or you would not be able to see they and the occasional good article in it , I have to admit I find Vogue too pretentious . vogue want to be the voice of fashion , the voice of the high brow media but its clientele be the likes of you and I , ordinary people who can not afford to live the high life they be portray on its gloss fill page . personally I would rather spend my money on a movie ticket , I get to see a good thriller , sci-fus , romance etc , etc I do not have to know about the substence abuse and emotional demon that haunt a particular actor 's life , I be just interested in enjoy myself for a couple of hour before I go back to my hard work life in the real world . vogue be try to sell I a dream that I do not really want to buy into , never have a penchant for sell my soul to the devil , it be get two star though because the photography be really superb , shame about the rest of it though .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	i agree i be ready to order for a friend & myself until i see they put you life in anyone hand that want it why would i do that to a friend oh well @ least they tell you upfront
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	4	keep a copy of Vogue in the kitchen , bedroom , and bathroom . one critique though , the page retain puke and gastric juice and begin to smell a little funny after a while . you would think that the sample of Aqua di Gio would cover it up , but no. .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I order this for my sister for Christmas . I leave a note under the tree say she first issue would come in March . she be so excited ! she be be get they regularly ever since , we still have 6-7 month leave . the only complaint I have be , I have they put she name in the address label . they put she first name , add a `` e '' at the end of it , then put my name after . ex : ASHLYNNE NICOLE JONES . if Ashlynn be she name and Nicole Jones be mine . that be not what I put in the order . but it be no big deal . it be all about the contents of the magazine anyway .
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I grow up read National Geographic , cherish its splendid photography and exceptional journalism . indeed , it have get better over time , offer cutting-edge story range from genetics to global warming . to its everlasting credit , National Geographic have never lose sight of the `` human element '' in its story , provide its readership with balanced reporting cover all side of a issue , often take the pulse of those affect . it be - and still remain - a exciting armchair `` explorer '' , take reader to distant locale across the globe . but now , you be as likely to read about dispose nuclear waste in the former Soviet Union as well as the people of a newly independent country in the South Pacific . one of National Geographic 's strongest strength have be its photography , and its current staff include some of today 's finest documentary photographer and photojournalist , whose work often rival that from independent photo agency such as black star and Magnum Photos . without question , this remain one of the finest magazine publish now .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	-- as the previous reviewer state , this be not a publication that have much meat to it . but I not only find fault with its ommission but also with what it do contain . if you be seek a authentically catholic perspective , look elsewhere . in its attempt to be inclusive this publication have give the name Catholic to much that be not . a good magazine be faith and Family , though it appeal more to woman . perhaps if one be look for devotional and biblical content , he could look into Magnificat .
Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	1	if you be look for catholic news , culture , spirituality , history , apologetic , liturgical update , or DOCTRINE , THIS be certainly not the magazine for you . the article feature in Cath . dig . be HETERODOX -lrb- not orthodox -rrb- , and stray -- in tendency or in explicit term -- from the magisterium of the Church . anti-christian feminism , homosexual activism , and general modernist revisionism and a rebellious `` anti-dogmalism '' pervade the page of `` Catholic '' Digest , though often -lrb- but not always -rrb- with veil language . for Catholics try to get they faith straight , or Protestants and non-Catholics try to find out more about what the christian faith be all about , stay away from this publication !!  as a cleric and a pastor of the flock of God , I strongly urge you not to purchase this magazine .  the Rev. Enzo G. Selvaggi
Magazine_Subscriptions	POS	5	I frequently change magazine subscription just to see what be out there . Harpers , however , be a staple and for the simple reason that its writing be the best and the most varied in term of length and subject matter . the real measure of its success be that I will wade into article , memoirs and discussion , whatever the subject , and find I come away with something to talk about with friend instead of a hour spend with teaser paragraph and no payoff . you know the feeling from coffee table mag where you eye wind up tired and inside you head a dull tom-tom begin to beat ... Harpers be a strange amalgam of irreverence , analysis , personal revelation and humor that put it somewhere between the New York Review of Books , the New Yorker and Mother Jones -- without the brand that the other cordon you with . check it out and be sure to read the piece not usually on you checklist . they 'll take you place you have not be .

Magazine_Subscriptions	NEG	2	Acoustic Guitar magazine be O.K. it 'll give you a few page of musical idea and accompany tab to try . I subscribe for a year -lrb- I have be play acoustic for 4 year -rrb- before I let my subscription lapse . why do I let it lapse ? well , for starter , the lack of a good digital edition be a factor . but more important , like all publication , Acoustic Guitar depend on advertiser for its existence . naturally , it feature review of guitar , accessory , electronics , etc. , in every issue . but , unlike in more reputable publication , these review be worthless , because they be always good review ! every guitar have a nice warm sound . every accessory would be a great Christmas gift . can you imagine if movie review be write this way -lrb- focus only on the good thing , and ignore the problem ? -rrb- Ebert would be give every movie two thumb up . or , if Consumer Reports rating every product the same -lrb- everything be a Editors ' choice ! -rrb- . the bottom line : Acoustic Guitar Magazine be a shill for its advertiser , plain and simple . -lrb- this problem seem pervasive in the music world . while Amazon be great and allow negative review , other online music store do not allow negative review . -rrb-
